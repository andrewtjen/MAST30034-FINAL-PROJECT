**Abstract**: Essays are an important metric for academic achievement, but they are expensive and time consuming for teachers to grade. An accurate, automated scoring system can provide a fast and effective solution to mass grade essays. Teachers could use the time and resource saved to focus on more important tasks. Our project is focused on using various artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to automate essay grading. Our best final average kappa score was 0.744.

**Models**: Logisitic Regression, Feed Forward Neural Network, LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), BERT-SVR, can be found ![here](https://github.com/thomasbowes/MAST30034-FINAL-PROJECT/tree/master/Models)
