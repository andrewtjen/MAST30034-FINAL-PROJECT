12253,20716,8, A long time ago when I was in third grade I had a friend @PERSON who's mom was in a bad mood. She never laughed and she never smiled. Every time I saw her I would smile at her and all she would do was frown and keep walking. At first I didn't know she was a grouch i just thought she didn't like me or something.When @PERSON told me his mom was a grouch I started to laugh and laugh. He asked me what was so funny i told him that i thought his mom didn't like me or something because every time I see his mom I would smile at her and all she will do is frown and walk away. That made my friend laugh we were cracking up so hard that we got in trouble in class.   The next day @PERSON and I were eating lunch at school when he says to me &lt;hey your pretty good at making people laugh&gt;. I said &lt;no I am not my jokesare horrible&gt;. He said &lt;@CAPS lets put them to the test go up to some one new to this school&gt;. I said @CAPS so we went around the whole school looking for a new student unfortunately we couldn't find one we heard the bell ring and we ran to our class. We sat in the back of the classroom its only @PERSON and I and anempty seat between us. We were excited because our teacher @PERSON was going to show us a movie. @PERSON got the front of the room andclass today I have an announcement we have a new student in our class say hello to @LOCATION. @ORGANIZATION walked through the door. @PERSON told @ORGANIZATION shecould sit in the back in between @PERSON and I. She sat down turned to the both of us and said hello. @PERSON gave me a look that said tell her the joke and @CAPS him a thumbs up. I turned to @LOCATION and said hi I'm @CAPS do you want to hear a joke. @ORGANIZATION said yeah sure. I started &lt;@CAPS knockshe said &lt;who's thereI said &lt;booshe said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. At first she didn't laugh because she didn't get it but duringthe middle of the movie she said &lt;ohhhh I get itand she started to laugh. @PERSON turned to me and said &lt;I told you so&gt;.   @PERSON got this crazy idea that if I spent the night at his house that I could make his mom laugh or at least make her smile. I said &lt;@CAPS sounds like a plan&gt;. I asked mt mom if it was @CAPS if I could spend the night at @PERSON house she said &lt;yeah just make sure its @CAPS with his mom&gt;. @PERSON asked his mom she said it was @CAPS. When I got to @PERSON house the first thing we did was play video games. When it was dinner time we all sat down at the table to eat @PERSON and I were on one side and his parents on the other. When we started eating @PERSON told me to tell the joke to his parents i said @CAPS. So I said to them &lt;@CAPS @CAPS&gt;they replied &lt;who's thereI said &lt;boothey said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. His parents started to laugh and laugh and they keptlaughing for like five minutes. @PERSON turned to me and yelled it worked his mom asked what worked. @PERSON explained everything to them. His mom told usthat her mom had recently died and that's why she was in a bad mood. After dinner we went to bed and fell asleep. The next morning when my mom came to pick me up she asked me how the sleep over went. I said it was fun I made people laugh. She said @CAPS but laughter isn't going to help you clean your roomall i could say was gosh darn it.             FIN,18,16,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12254,20717,8," Softball has to be one of the single most greatest sports alive; playing softball in college has always been a goal of mine. I love the dirt that sticks to your face, the sweat dripping from your forehead, and the gallons and gallons of water you poor all over yourself to keep cool in the blistering @CAPS. Although I love softball I feel that the memories you acquire from the times you have with your teammates, are the things you remember the most through out your softball career. I have always had great memories through softball many laughs, tears, and frustrations so when I had the opportunity to play on a top notch team I looked forward to all the many more memories I would have.  Hood @CAPS @CAPS was my team name, I had played almost four years with this local team. Many of these girls were like sisters to me they had treated me amazingly through out my years playing with them. I felt like I had my set team, I was going to play with these girls all though high school and we would become even closer. As my fifth year now approached I was looking forward to it, but when my dad came up with the idea that maybe I play for a team not as locally, that idea was also very enticing. I now faced a big dilemma either stay with the team I knew so well and continue to play with them until high school ended; or play with a team I knew nothing about, play with girls that might not like me, girls that were so much better then me, and looked down upon me. As I looked at the pros and cons of both teams I decided no; I would stay with the team that I knew so well and I would stay comfortable at where I was at. At that point softball was just around the corner and I began to reanalyze everything. Did I really want to stay and be comfortable? Or maybe challenge myself to become a better player; maybe i could work hard enough, and have college scouts take a look at me and hopefully have me play for them later. I then decided I would take a chance and try for this team.  As my dad and I drove to the field where I would try out for this team, my stomach was in knots. I wanted this team to like me, I was playing all the possible ways in my head I could greet them so i didn't sound snobby or a grump. The time moved quickly and I wished it would slow; my heart felt like it was beating a million times per second. I was so nervous my mouth began to feel sticky and have an odd taste to it, soon after my mouth became bone dry no taste, no flavor, just a sticky mess. The car then was stationary my dad looked at me and just said ""ready or not here we come"". Nervous began to take over my body my arms were shaking uncontrollably and I was second guessing every move I made, I even had troubles removing my seat belt.  As I approached the field it felt like time was in slow motion, walking by I saw all the girls turn there heads to see what new fresh meat had arrived. My first thought was to run; that was it I didn't want to go, I was done I wanted home I was ready to start my year with the @CAPS, I just couldn't take it. Then as I walked onto the field they all grew a smile. Each and everyone of them told me their names, there favorite color, and a small fun fact about themselves. I found myself laughing through out my whole try out, there were no awkward moments and I enjoyed my time there. I couldn't wait to go back, I now had made new friends, friends I knew I would grow close with. My year with this team was amazing I have friendships with these girls that I never would have discovered if I hadn't gone. Those girls are like family, and the coaches even more so. Laughter played a very big role in the decision I made to play with this team, if I had just gone and tried out, and had I not had fun and laughed, I would have decided to play with the @CAPS. I have had great memories with the @CAPS, but also softball is all about going out discovering new friendships; therefore, enjoying the sport as well as the people.",21,26,46.0,46,0.0,0.0,0.0,46.0
12255,20718,8," Some people like making people laugh, I love it. I will do most anything to get a good laugh. I will make fun of my self, do insanely stupid things, and sometimes hurt myself (not in any serious way). When I was little I didn't really understand laughter. For some odd reason I could never tell the difference if people were laughing at something or laughing with it. I was kind of ""special"" in some areas as a kid (I still am today). Still at the tender age of five I loved making people laugh, and being special I would do even crazier things for a laugh. Mind you I was kind of a spaz, and a really big spaz. I was the most hyperactive five year old you will ever meet. For example one time I hit myself in the head with a hammer, another time I was dancing around in class with a pencil in my hand, stabbed myself in the head with it, and needed stitches. One of the craziest times though was a couple days before I had to take pictures and I wanted to go play outside, my mom knowing how ""special"" I was (I got it from her) wouldn't allow me to. The expert persuasive kid I was back then convinced her to let me go outside. Before I could even reach the street I fell head first on to the corner of the sidewalk leaving a huge mark and completely ruining the pictures. Although that might make some people laugh, this is a story about laughter not me being a spaz.  Now that you know that I love making people laugh, I'm ""special"", and that I'm a complete spaz I can get on with the story. Well I was in kindergarten and I loved school because I got to hang out with my friends and play with blocks, that might sound stupid but I was in kindergarten. The only thing I didn't like about kindergarten was bully's. Surprisingly I have never had a bully except kindergarten, but this was a bad bully. He would give me wedgies at story time and the whole deal (which was the best time to do so because the teacher could couldn't see). I still know the bully too, but he's no bully anymore, he's a goody two shoes now which I think is odd. Anyways, kindergarten was a very good year for me except one day (and every day I got a wedgies). That day is what this whole story is about, it's why I told you I love making people laugh, why I told you I'm ""special"", and a spaz, everything in the story circles around this one day, *dramatic pause* in kindergarten. It started out like any other day in kindergarten. I woke up, did my daily routine, hopped in the car, and headed to school. When I got to school I grabbed my daily binder and patted the education sign like a mall cop would pat the observe and report sign. I did all my work and colored (which was basically all my work). It came around break so we ran around the play ground and got are little snack. When we finished getting the last few drops out of our juice boxes we headed over to story time. We were all in the little circle (which was more like a deformed oval) listening to the story, right when I would get into the story and lose my guard I would receive an excruciatingly painful (for a five year old) wedgie. The story was almost finished and our five year old attention spans were wearing thin and we were getting all excited. The story finally finished and we were standing up, and this is where my memory starts to fade. I cracked a really funny joke and the whole kindergarten class erupted into laughter, me being a ""special"" spaz that can't tell if people are laughing at me or with me burst into tears. I remember balling my eyes out at the drinking fountain trying to hide my tears. One of the teachers tried to help me by telling me that they were laughing at my joke. It took me a couple minutes to stop crying but a little longer to realize the were not laughing at me.  To this day I still get reminded by classmates about that day, of course I can laugh about it now but that was in kindergarten, I'm in ninth grade now and for people to remember that is kind of crazy to me. It was a negative experience then, but it turned into a blessing in disguise. It made me grow into a better person, I can tell the difference of laughter and also be okay when people do laugh at me (doing dumb things to make people laugh at me is actually my forte). So remember, being ""special"" could sometimes be the best thing about you, what makes you who you are, what makes you great, what makes you grow, what makes people laugh.",15,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12256,20719,8," ""LAUGHTER""  @CAPS I hang out with my friends, the one thing we do best is laugh sometimes for no reason. The thing we tend to laugh about is running into trash cans, laundry or maybe even about what we ate for dinner the @TIME before. @CAPS I am usual stressed out the one thing I love is to hangout with my friends. they usual are good listeners. overall. Though they take your mind off things. So with my friends you can count on having a great time no matter what the occasion is.    @CAPS I say trash can I really mean trash cans I remember this one time in the hall way at school my friend was hanging on to my back pack because she tends to loose me in the hall way a lot because I walk a lot faster then her, anyways the class bell had just rouge an all the student were heading to lunch we were. I was just getting ready to cross the hall way an she said don't do it, so I did an nobody stopped! so she kinda slide into a trash can that was hanging on the wall in the hall way, she @MONTH have knocked it off but I can't really say? I was still walking an the sound effects were so funny I laugh at it still.       My friend an I have a inside joke? we went out to lunch together. @CAPS we saw a laundry mate an I minds went crazy, we made up a funny joke an said that we should make our self's aprons with lots color and rhinestones, so that way if we wanted to get all of our laundry done at the same time. We would take off our clothes there an put on our so called aprons. An do our laundry like it was nothing. @CAPS our laundry was done we said that we could pick out a new outfit because all of r close would be clean. yes we are weird but that is what makes us laugh more then anything is being silly an making up story just like that one.  Now about the food its sort of like the laundry but I guess better? I remember @CAPS i came to school the next day i just started talking about what i had for dinner @TIME i think at that time my mom had asked us if we wanted chicken @PERSON an my sister as i screamed an said hell yeah? so dinner was ready an @CAPS we went to go site at the table we looked at it an it was not what we expected it to be? it was frozen out of a box an it looked like somebody had eaten the food than puked it back up? it was that great looking.    All of these thing that have named or talked about is how my life is almost everyday @CAPS there not drama i love my friend I don't think I could have asked for a better one because all we do is laugh an have fun an fun in to trash can locker an whatever else there is but the one thing that matter the most with my one friend is that @CAPS we get in to a fight we can not stay mad at each other well I now that I can't. So at the end of the day I ask her are we done being made at each other? an than we just look at each other an laugh because that about all we can do because the reason was so stupid there was really no need for it.that is what a friend is to me having fun not worrying about what is around us. but just to have fun an be silly. not anybody else but are self's an sometime @CAPS we have are really goofy days? we make up the story about our laundry. talking about my life with my friends is nothing better than to laugh because deep down inside you an your friend will look back an say wow those where the best day was @CAPS-would would get in trouble in class for talking way to much.

12259,20723,8," My best friend, @PERSON and I have been close ever since we were @NUM. We met through @CAPS @CAPS lessons at our local dance studio. We've stayed close throughout the years because we've always done similar activities. We're very different from each other though. I'm more out going, I like to speak my mind and I'm more carefree. @CAPS's the opposite. @CAPS's very conservative and @CAPS can take things too seriously. But either way, we manage to even each other out. Finals week had just gotten over, and @LOCATION and I had been planning a sleepover all week. We just needed time to relax and have some time to ourselves. When I had gotten home from school, I gave her a quick call. ""@CAPS?"" @CAPS answered. ""@CAPS, @CAPS time did @CAPS wanna hang out?"" I asked. ""I was thinking @NUM?"" ""@CAPS good!"" I quickly hung up the phone and gathered up my gear. I grabbed my toothbrush, pillow, pajamas, and my blanket. I put my shoes on and headed back out the door. My dad dropped me off with all of me gear. I had brought my pajamas, my pillow, and an extra blanket. I walked up her sidewalk to her door, knocked, and waited. Only seconds later did @CAPS answer it with a big smile across her face. @CAPS lead me down to her basement where @CAPS had all the junk food set out ready for us to attack. @CAPS had gone to the store earlier that day and had bought everything. @CAPS had set it all up on her old pool table that nobody used. There were chips, cookies, sodas, candy, chocolate, and pizza. I set my stuff down on the chair in the corner of the room and we feasted. Of course, we could eat all the food. We simply weren't big enough. After eating for almost an hour straight, we laid on her basement floor trying to gain composure. We started laughing at silly little things that came up on commercials on her big screen @CAPS. Eventually, we got to talking about how each of our finals went. ""I did soo good on all of mine! I'm gonna get ALL A's"" @PERSON bragged. @CAPS has gotten straight A's every year since middle school. ""I think I did pretty @CAPS too, not so sure about a @NUM though."" I said as I was laying upside down on the floor. ""@CAPS, we'll just see tomorrow!""  We finally decided to move ourselves over to the couch on the opposite side of the pool table, so we could face the @CAPS. It was already @NUM in the @TIME and we were still on a sugar high. We switched back and forth from watching some old scary movie, and the top @NUM music videos of the week. That had passed some time and before we knew it, it was @NUM in the @TIME. @PERSON and I were laying on opposite ends of each other. Occasionally, one of us would get some chips or candy from the table. We grew tired to the point where we couldn't keep our eyes open. No one even had enough energy to turn off the overhead light. We fell asleep fast. When I woke-up the next @TIME, @PERSON wasn't laying across from me anymore. @CAPS was sitting in the corner chair where I had set my stuff. I looked at the clock, and it was already @NUM:30 in the afternoon. I looked back and @LOCATION, @CAPS seemed somewhat upset. I shifted around under my blanket so I could face her. ""@CAPS..."" I grunted, while I was stretching. ""@TIME."" @CAPS said abruptly. @CAPS was holding a folded piece of paper in her hand. ""@CAPS's up?"" I asked, sitting up on the couch. @CAPS crumpled up the piece of paper and threw it at me. I picked it up from my lap and unfolded it. It was her report card. I scanned down the paper looking at all of her grades. @CAPS had received all A's... and one @CAPS. @CAPS had gotten a @CAPS in her @CAPS class. I looked up from the paper to see her hands covering her face. I walked over to her kinda amused by how upset @CAPS was.  ""@CAPS got a @CAPS... and @CAPS're crying?"" I asked. @CAPS looked up at me quickly. I looked at her with a stupid face, and @CAPS busted out laughing. @CAPS felt so stupid for crying over @NUM @CAPS. I stared laughing too. I knew my grades we be far worse. Heck, I'd be glad to get @CAPS's. @PERSON and I are the perfect best friends. We even each other out. I tell her to lighten up, and @CAPS tells me to focus more. @CAPS can't take little things like that too seriously, it's just not worth the stress. Sometimes @CAPS just gotta relax, and maintain your focus. @CAPS have to find your perfect balance of work, and play.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12260,20724,8,"  Laughter is a really good thing to have in any relationship you are in whether its a friend ship, a love relation ship, or work relation ship. Either way you need laughter so you don't get so up tight that you are no fun to be around. Every now and then some body around you in your life needs some laughter to cheer them up. people should laugh every day because it makes you feel happy even when you are in a really bad mood.When you are being suicidal all you really want is some one to talk to you and make you smile, laugh, and giggle. It really feels good when you laugh with a friend or a significant other. You like to see people smile and laugh. Your friends and family also like to see you laugh here and there once in awhile. So every now and then laugh for once and be happy even if it is for a few seconds in your life. Laughter is a major thing to have in your life. Its nice to laugh and giggle even when life gets you down and is crappy. Anyone and everyone needs to laugh so they don't become so grouchy and unbearable to be around. So please for ever ones sake around you and in your life please laugh. Come on, you know you want to laugh. Ha ha ha. I hope that at least made you smile a little bit.

12261,20725,8," I believe that with all people laughter, and having a sense of humor, is something that generally everyone has in common, everyone loves to share with others. Among young teenage girls, laughter is a commodity that is infectious but always wonderful. It's the purest kind of joy we have, it's somethings that brings humans together. It's the beginning and end of friendship and unity. Laughter can ring out and lift the spirits of those that really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright. We all know that feeling of dread, and sadness . The kindness, generosity, and good of laughter is one of the few things that are right nowadays. Even in poverty, depression, and oppression the simple joy of laughter can wash away a person's worries for a split second and fill us with utter warmth.  @PERSON and I have been the best of friends since we were ten-years-old, and laughter has always been our strongest element. @PERSON and I have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry. We've decided that apart, we're just a little funny, but with our powers combined we could make anyone laugh. We use that power on each other when we're having bad days, or we simply need some cheering up. I think if it wasn't for laughter we wouldn't even be friends anymore. It really is what brings us together as best friends. We'd be different people. Even if I drifted from her we'd always be cracking jokes, making each others guts hurt, and tearing up from laughing so hard.  My first impression of @PERSON was of her stomping down to our neighborhood park to yell at her sister, whom I had been playing with at the time. It would be a very self-explanatory reason of why I didn't like her at first. Luckily, after going to @PERSON's house with her sister, @PERSON and I found that we had many things in common, and we were only four months apart. That childish kind of cajoling held our friendship together, for it was a bit rocky at the beginning. Always fighting, and arguing about things that now, we look back on and laugh at our adolescent stupidity. Either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize. One time she proceeded to tell me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remind each other of things like that and have a good ole time laughing about it. We were mere @NUM-year-old's then. Now, almost @NUM, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and make the best of what we've got with our poking fun. Laughter was definitely the band-aid in the beginning of our rickety friendship. @PERSON has a gift to make anything funny at any time. She says the wrong (but hilarious) things, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us, it's what keeps our friendship so strong. I think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows that it wasn't a good day if you haven't laughed or let alone smiled. People would be dull, and just unhappy. Laughter heals people from sickness, it gives us the feeling that maybe everything is going to be okay after all. I truly believe that it's healthy for you. With a flip of a switch, laughing can bring within us an ecstatic, and serendipitous feeling. People take it for granted and use it for wrong when it's meant to spread the word of happiness. We're lucky to have a gift of such natural joy. Can anyone even explain, in detail, the feeling laughter truly brings us? I think not. It's like describing the scent of something. You just can't do it. The words aren't there. I think of those poor and miserable people that have forgotten what it feels like to laugh, and it's very sad. I strive to laugh every single day, and make at least one other person laugh. What is a life without a diamond in the rough like laughter? It's no life at all, for laughter will always be your shelter on the pursuit of happiness.",21,20,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0

One time @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS and I stayed up until three in the @TIME. We were so delirious, and kooky, we acted like crazy people. Now we have the type of relationship where we can @CAPS at almost anything. Literally almost anything... As we were staying up, we drank lots of soda and had sugary foods to fuel us for the night. We made up songs, we danced around @CAPS house, and @CAPS felt like we laughed for hours! I laughed until tears were flowing out of @CAPS eyes, and i couldn't get a breath out of @CAPS heaving lungs. When @CAPS gets to the silent laughing, @CAPS's even more funny because that person can't control @CAPS, and they look so hilarious because there rocking back and forth, with this silly expression upon their face, not making any noise at all.

Without laughter we couldn't express our happy, out going side, we would have no particullar feeling in life except for frowning, which is a proven fact to cose more wrinkles beacuse of how many more muscles it uses.  For me laughter is a all day thing, @CAPS show, my friends, family and, horses are my number one reason for my frown to be tured up side down. You @MONTH think horses cant smile, or talk but @CAPS do have their own ways of showing a personality that will make you laugh. Shere @CAPS are all smart, but @CAPS can be clutsy or goofy at times. Mostly @CAPS all just make you laugh and giggle like your own little brothers or sisters.  There is this one time that I will always have locked away in the back of my mind. It took place on a @DATE mid-day at the beach on the @ORGANIZATION. I was with my friend and we both had our two horses saddled, ready to go. Both us and our horses felt the energy rush when we saw the waves pouning at the shore with the salty smell in our noses.  Once we hit the sand we were running side by side with the wind wistling past our ears like a moving train. The horses heads were equaly pointed towards the ocean. When we got to the water, the horses pranced and danced arounds like yearlings again, @CAPS would walk tell into the water tell it was drenching us both then soon as the next wave would come rushing up, we'ed swerve around and try to beat the wave to the shore.   After about five hours of adventuring caves, sand dunes and starfish we were all worn out, then decided to call it a day. It was around dinner time, so we eat dinner while watching the sun go down to finsih the perfuct day at the beach. We put the horses back in the trailer, and before I shut the trailer door I gave my horse a good pat on his neck, as I was about to walk out my horse tured his head, then gave my a nudge like he was saying ""thanks for the good time"". Driving home I knew this was a perfuct day because of the laughter, and of all the times I just laughed for the injoyment, also my face did hurt a little from smiling so much.",16,15,0.0,31,0.0,0.0,0.0,31.0

Those are the names of my identical twin cousins @ORGANIZATION I can honestly admit that they are @NUM of the funniest kids I know. My uncle isn't exactly the most intelligent human on earth, @ORGANIZATION by the way he named his children it's apparent that his sense of humor is a little bit off, but he's a really hard working man. Occasionally my mom does him favors by taking the twins off his hands for a little while because they can be a handful. Weekends are specifically better to have them over because of my hateful step siblings whom hate me, my brother, my sister, @ORGANIZATION even my mom. The amount of tension in the house isn't a healthy amount, so a couple of @NUM @DATE old running around livens it up a little @ORGANIZATION makes us all laugh together as a family. It must have been @DATE in @DATE when @CAPS was home @ORGANIZATION we were building onto our house when the twins came over. My mom was getting quite furious at their insanely high energy levels, she appeared to be on the verge of ripping out all her hair. My step dad @PERSON needed to go to @PERSON's for nails @ORGANIZATION child locks @ORGANIZATION I decided to tag along with him. I thought it would have been a great idea to take the twins with us, just to relieve my mom of the loud mouths for a few minutes. We loaded up the car @ORGANIZATION I drove down the highway, amused with the twins in the back seat playing with the ponies @ORGANIZATION laughing at the people stopped at red lights. We all sang songs like twinkle twinkle little star, @ORGANIZATION the @ORGANIZATION's until we arrived in the @PERSON's parking lot. @ORGANIZATION finds it pretty hilarious to run down the isles @ORGANIZATION hide behind items on the lower shelves, while @ORGANIZATION enjoys pretending he's @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION getting @CAPS confused. Eventually the twins were being too obnoxious, resulting in @LOCATION @ORGANIZATION me catching them @ORGANIZATION holding them as captives in the seat-belts of the @PERSON's cart. It was helpful but didn't do as much justice as we had hoped. We continued along on our adventure in search of the child locks, @ORGANIZATION found them down isle @NUM. There was a large man standing in front of our destination @ORGANIZATION when i say large I don't mean muscular, or tall... I mean he probably has a few too many @CAPS shows he watches daily, @ORGANIZATION maybe a few too many favorite snacks. His hair was long @ORGANIZATION sandy blond, he wore a dark purple @CAPS die shirt @ORGANIZATION slip on sandals. @ORGANIZATION apparently hadn't realized how inappropriate it is to talk about a person in a rude fashion, especially when they can hear you. He said, ""@CAPS cow @ORGANIZATION look at that lady! She's so huge!"" @ORGANIZATION laughed outrageously @ORGANIZATION agreed. ""@CAPS! She's as big as our whole car!"" I panicked a bit @ORGANIZATION tried to get them to be quiet, however the twins paid @CAPS attention to me, they were much more excited to see the man on the tall ladder next to me giggling @ORGANIZATION laughing along with them. They were quiet for a moment then @ORGANIZATION gasped @ORGANIZATION exclaimed, "" @CAPS she's as big as a fire truck!"" The man turned around @ORGANIZATION glared at me; i apologized at least @NUM times @ORGANIZATION started to take the boys out of the isle when the man on the ladder hit a button to make the ladder move. I was walking behind the larger man when the ladder made a ridiculously loud beeping sound, like that of a construction vehicle. The boys screamed in fear @ORGANIZATION shouted frantically, ""@CAPS run as fast as you can hurry! She's backing up @ORGANIZATION she's going to squish you on the floor!"" @CAPS laughed, even the man they were making fun of, but i was so embarrassed that i just took them to the car @ORGANIZATION waited for @PERSON. I tried to explain to the boys in the car that only big trucks beep when they are backing up, but unsurprisingly, they didn't listen to a word i said. @PERSON only took approximately @NUM more minutes before he came jogging out the door with the nails, the child locks, @ORGANIZATION a gigantic smile plastered on his face. I thought about what had happened in the store @ORGANIZATION i chuckled quietly until @PERSON hopped into the truck, then i started laughing profusely. When I returned home I told my mom what had happened, she laughed for a while @ORGANIZATION i laughed even harder @ORGANIZATION quite a bit longer than i had before.

Have you ever been walking around a store and you spot two couples laughing , having fun? I have and sometimes i feel like being in that same place. My grandmother always tells me her stories about her and my grandpa when they were young. She always says ""laughter plays a big part in our relationship"".  She was @NUM and @CAPS was @NUM the first time they met. Everyone always said they were never going to last, but the only way they could find out is to wait and believe. She felt like singing everytime she heard his name. She said she would walk into their shadows with him. She felt like all her problems would go away, everytime she had the chance to hang out with him. Everytime she could think about him she would smile and laugh. Thats how happy she felt about him. Can we call it love? I say it was, sometimes I wish I was in love like my grandmother is. She seems so happy everytime she talks about him, but i still dont know if laughter is @CAPS kept them together for so long. I see a really huge smile on my grandmother everytime she says, ""@CAPS didn't have the brightest head in the world, but @CAPS always knew how put a smile on my face"". Because she says that @CAPS wasn't so smart but @CAPS knew how to make jokes, and make her laugh. A question she asked me once ""@CAPS do you think of two couples when you see them laughing, having a good time"". The first thing that pops to your head is that they know how to have fun and doesnt let anything get in their ways of laughing and having a goodtimes. My grandmother says that the thing that kept her and my grandpa together was laughter, because if you dont know howe to make the other person laugh you dont know if you could have a good time with that person. When my grandparents are mad at each other it never last to long because my gandpa always knows how to make her laugh. Maybe if they didn't know how to make each other laugh than maybe they wouldnt be together still. I understand now my grandmother felt in love with my grandpa, because of how @CAPS made her laugh. In a relationship you always have to know how to put a smile on the other person, because if you dont know than pretty sure things will not work out. My grandmother was right, laughter does play a big part in their relationship.They alwasy know how to make everything better by making jokes or by doing something funny.

I've had days when all I could think about was how @CAPS life sucked, or at least seemed to. The days when you feel like everything is going wrong, and nothing could make it worse... And that'@CAPS when one of @CAPS best friends will make me laugh. I'll laugh so hard I'm on the verge of @CAPS @CAPS pants and @CAPS eyes water. I'll laugh so hard no sound comes out, @CAPS sides cramp and I fall on the floor. They make me laugh so hard, sometimes I think that even if I was in a coma, they'd say something so funny that I'd sit straight up in the hospital bed and @CAPS laugh the huge belly laugh that sometimes escapes me.    There was this particular time when @DATE, @CAPS and I were feeling more giggly than usual. It tends to happen a lot when we're together, but this time was way different than the others. We staggered to @CAPS'@CAPS house flushed and giddy at how funny everything was. You know how it is when you and your best friends @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS so tickled by each other? Those times when you glance at your friend and @CAPS as you've begun to calm down, you see her pinched expression from trying not to laugh, and you lose it all over again. If you've ever had the pleasure of experiencing these silly moments, try imagining that feeling for hours at a time. I'm pretty sure I developed a whole new set of abdominal muscles that day, if that gives you any idea how hard we were laughing.    Anyway, we stumbled into her house, trying to get serious, since we did have to do at least some of our homework. Of course we were starving after all that laughing, so @CAPS told @ORGANIZATION and me that we could get some cereal. @CAPS regular milk and cereal, right? There'@CAPS nothing @CAPS special about @CAPS'n @CAPS (besides that it'@CAPS freaking delicious). But on that day, everything was out of the ordinary, especially the milk. It was the most amazing milk I'd ever tasted, and I @CAPS, @CAPS, @CAPS, milk, so that had to mean something. ""@CAPS this milk is so good! @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS!"" @ORGANIZATION exclaimed. I swear she was about to choke on her own spoon, she was eating so fast. ""@CAPS you kidding me with this? What kind of milk do you buy?!"" I blurted out. For some reason that milk was really extraordinary, and it was seriously blowing @CAPS mind. ""@CAPS, I don'@CAPS know. Two percent?""@CAPS looked at us incredulously, a curious eyebrow raised at our inquiries. Her expression made us all fall apart in peals of laughter. Now whenever one of us brings it up, we still laugh like it @CAPS happened.    @TIME, it happened. @CAPS peed her pants, and not @CAPS a little. It wasn'@CAPS @CAPS the idle threat rushed out, the ""@CAPS'mgoingtopee!"" squeal. @CAPS no. She actually peed herself, and I still @CAPS'@CAPS even remember what I said to make her laugh that hard. All I know is suddenly (scaring me half way to death), she yelled out, ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS I @CAPS'@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS! THERE'@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS!!"" I whipped around and saw @CAPS, red-faced and open-mouthed, supporting herself against the counter. She looked like the freaking @CAPS @CAPS of @LOCATION all bent over like she was. Her eyes were closed tight, crinkling at the corners, a few stray tears escaping as she tried to hold in shrieks of (apparently) crippling laughter. It took me a second to realize what was going on, and then I was totally straight out laughing at her; pointing and laughing @CAPS shoulder-shake laugh, and it only made her laugh harder. Still laughing, she did a penguin-type run down the hall to the bathroom, where @DATE was. @CAPS, in her wet jeans and with a red, tear streaked face, burst through the bathroom door, looking slightly bewildered and amused with what @CAPS happened. So naturally, @ORGANIZATION laughed at the sight of her, in her comically delirious state. Who wouldn'@CAPS have?   The fact that we @CAPS always laugh at each other and ourselves is why I love @CAPS friends . It'@CAPS great when you have people that you @CAPS laugh about everything and nothing with. @CAPS is practically a walking ego boost because she laughs at every joke, and @ORGANIZATION'@CAPS pretty clever when it comes to thinking of them.

That's what I've heard my whole life, but as I've grow and really started thinking for myself I came up with my own kind of survival guide, if you will, to good relationships for anyone. Sure trust is important but @CAPS isn't the only key factor, I've learned laughter is just as important to not only starting a relationship but keeping @CAPS full of life. One person in my life helped me really understand that and be able to have that relationship with them. My mom and I have such a great bond and way of understanding with each other, other girls I know don't always have that with their mothers, I am very fortunate. Sure we have hard times just like any family, but we are able tolaugh @CAPS off with time and start new. @CAPS helped me realize, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""  @CAPS a great bond with my mom is so important to me, we have not always ran so smoothly though. From about age ten to thirteen I was a bit troubled in the sense of not wanting to show my emotions, I just wanted to stay quite.Then seeing my mom as someone who was strong and beautiful, I have to admit I was a bit worried @CAPS would think I was a disappointment. I guess I was afraid to show who I really was to her. Whenever @CAPS would joke around with me I would take @CAPS all to seriously and whenever we would fight about small things I thought @CAPS would hate me forever. I know now I was silly to think that, but I'm actually glad we went through that. I think that's part of what made us stronger, like how there would be no rainbow without the rain or how there would be no happy ending if all was well throughout your whole life. Little did I know the light at the end of the tunnel was just around the corner. One night after dinner my mom had informed me that @CAPS was my night to do dishes, unlike usual I completely forgot and went to my room to listen to music and eventually fall asleep. My mother came in my room upset and frustrated. @CAPS said, ""@PERSON, why did you ignore me? The dishes need to be done now."" I jumped out of bed without a word and began walking to the kitchen. @CAPS followed me into the small bright room, ""@PERSON? Are you alright, @CAPS's okay that you forgot. I'm not mad."" @CAPS exclaimed. Again not a word escaped my lips. I was afraid to say anything, the only sound that came from me was a sigh of relief when I turned back around and noted her absence. When I was finished with the dishes @CAPS pulled me into my room. I tried reading her face, @CAPS looked worried. @CAPS explained to me the relationship between her and her mom that @CAPS so desperately wanted to have with me. @CAPS told me about how they would @CAPS together over silly things and how they promised each other that when they got into fights they would stop themselves, take a deep breath, then @CAPS. ""@CAPS? What? Why would you guys do that?"" I questioned.  @CAPS replied, "" @CAPS laughter is the best cure for any sad feeling or bad day, as grandma would always say."" @CAPS helped me experience that by tickling me and joking around. For the fist time in my life I wasn't nervous and I spoke my mind. As we sat there and chucked ourselves to sleep I knew things would be different from here on out, and they were. We now have made that promise to one other and we are able to have wonderful smiling memories together now. Now at fifteen years old I can honestly say without question my mom will always be my best and truest friend. Our bond, our way of getting over tough times, and the way we can @CAPS off all stressful things in life makes me feel as if I can get through anything.

This one time my boyfriend and I were laughing so hard. My boyfriend is my life. I spend pretty much everyday with him, he is so amazing. Me and him well we do everything together. He is very close to me. He is the best best friend anyone could ask for! I've only known him for about a year, a lot can happen in one year. You can meet new people, build relationships, and even move away from those relationships you just made. Me and @PERSON we are always laughing, at each other and at other things as well. We always have fun times with each other. It was a late @DATE @TIME and he was walking me home like he always did before. There is this field with extremely tall grass and we were walking right next to it. All of a sudden out of no where he acts like he is getting pulled into the grass. So guess what I did, I screamed as loud as I could possibly scream! Then he starts calling my name in a creepy voice telling me to come over to the grass. Out of curiosity of what just happened I start walking over towards the tall grass. When I arrived to the spot where he entered the grass he tells me ""@CAPS I lost my shoe and I can't seem to find it anywhere!"" @PERSON and I start looking everywhere for his shoe. We couldn't see anything because it was really dark, so we used our hands to search around for his shoe, ""I found it!"" I said. After we found the shoe we realized two hours went by. We were so tired we laid down in the grass to take and break and we both started cracking up with laughter because of how ridiculous it was that we spent two hours on something that was suppose to be a little joke! it was so awesome. When we finally got to our feet our bellies hurt so bad and were very sore. I have never laughed harder than that in my life. Every time I'm with @PERSON is the best time ever. We always seem to find a way to make each other laugh. Without best friends or even just friends you would probably find it hard to laugh. With friends you always have someone to laugh at and also laugh with. This is why i cherish my best friend @PERSON and all the happy and laughing times we have together, because you'll never know when the last time you'll see that person will be.

She try's to make people laugh and hurt them selves so she can get a kick out of it. All of my friends are funny. My best friend @LOCATION is the funniest girl I have ever known. She likes to dance funny and mock people that she doesn't like. When she works, she'll try to find something to make a joke out of, so she could bring it to me and almost make me pee my pants. @LOCATION's relationship was very bad. She loves to laugh but her boyfriend hates making jokes. She tried to stick it out but things got worse and worse. The only thing he would do is sit on his bed or his couch and play video games, or watch wrestling. He would make @LOCATION clean his room and do the dishes. He has a one year old sister and he makes her watch her,clean her, and feed her while he was up in hie room playing video games. @LOCATION got so tired of it , so she packed her stuff and she left.

I love to sit on the floor and watch him wrestle with all of the other cats.Every time I go into the kitchen he is always there with me, bagging for food. After he eats, he gets an erg of energy and runs all over the house. It makes me laugh. He will stop right in front of me and just stare at me, if I move then he will run away. Cats are cute but not all of them have the power to look into your soul like my cat. @CAPS has big eyes and his meow is so sweet and incessant. The funniest thing about him is how fat he is. He is a fat cat, but he is only one years old. So when I see him running all over the place it makes me laugh. My horse is the same way. His name is @CAPS, and he is four years old. He is a crazy horse, but at the same time he is very funny. He try's to play with my other horses and get hurt because he bites them, so they kick him back. He has a blue eye, so I bought him for my purposes. Some people thinks horses are just a bill, but I think they are my family.",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12272,20741,8," Everyone enjoys laughter. Everywhere you look there is always laughter. Laughter comes from being happy, and being happy comes from having joy in your life. Many times in my life I have had joy. I tend to laugh many times throughout the day on account of I am happy. One topic that brings me laughter is my niece. @CAPS @CAPS is two years old. She is the most adorable little girl in the world. At least in my opinion she is. Since she is so young she does not have a care or worry in the world. She knows everything is going to be taken care of. In this case she is full of joy, and happiness, which causes her laughter. When I am with her all that takes place is laughter, and playing. These are the greatest moments. @CAPS has this cookie jar, and when ever you put the shapes into the right slots it sings a silly little song. This song makes her laugh, and dance uncontrollably. Which in return gets me laughing. It soon ends up being a huge laugh fest. These are the greatest moments. Recently we had another addition added to the family. @PERSON, my nephew, and @CAPS brother. As @PERSON gets older, he keeps learning new things, and @CAPS loves it. She laughs harder then ever. She thinks it is the funniest thing when he starts laughing. These are the greatest moments. As we can see laughter is happy, and fun. Laughter starts with smiling, and smiling is also rooted from being happy. Many things make me laugh and smile. My niece and nephew is just one example.

12273,20742,8," Why is it that laughter can bring people so close together? Is it because laughing shows trust for one another, or is it simply because you understand each other. There many different kinds of laughter, like cracking a joke, or someone does something very embarrassing. The story that I will be telling is about how such a bad day for hunting turned into the funniest moments ever.   It all started in the @TIME when I woke up, and I had forgotten to put my wet clothes that were in the washer machine to the dryer. Now I had to dig through all my clothes up in my room and find camouflage clothes that weren't dirty, or were something that I could wear. By this time anybody would be in a bad mood, and trying rush to get out the door. When my buddy @PERSON showed up and was ready to go and I wasn't. I was rushing, and when you rush you are bound to forget something, and I had left my gun at the house. Five miles down the road I noticed that I had forgotten my gun, so we turned around and went back to go get it. Not only now we were late, we were speeding to the cabin for breakfast, @PERSON had the eggs so that we could make omelets. As we are racing down, we hit a bump in the road and everything, I mean everything hit the ceiling in the truck and then slammed to the floor. In doing this all the eggs broke in the egg carton, so now we had no eggs, and no eggs meant no breakfast.  Its about thirty minutes till shooting hours, and we are late showing up to the blind so that @PERSON and I can meet up with our other friends, @PERSON and @PERSON. Finally we get to the blind right before sunrise and while we are getting all set up, a group of twenty mallards drop in unexpected and took off before we could get a shot off. Now were all thinking great their goes our opportunity to redeem ourselves from a terrible @TIME. Only to find out that those ducks were the only ducks we saw all day.   At around twelve o'clock we gave up, and went back up to the cabin, but on the way up we got stuck in two inches of water in a truck. I remember thinking to myself, ""@CAPS this is not really happening to us right now"". So @PERSON, @PERSON, and I got out of the truck to push, and @PERSON stayed in the truck to drive. Their were many attempts to push the truck out, and finally on the sixth try we pushed the truck hard enough to get it out of the muddy water. Now the funny part, when we had broke the truck free @PERSON laid on the gas causing the truck tires to spin, and spray mud everywhere. When I saw the amount of mud being hurled everywhere I jumped behind @PERSON and used him as a shield from the mud. By this point @PERSON, and @PERSON are @CAPS in a inch thick layer of mud from head to toe. You couldn't help but laugh, it was the funniest thing ever. @PERSON had watched it all through his rear view mirror and as soon as he was safe from getting the truck stuck again, he fell out of the truck because he was laughing so hard. Even @PERSON, and @PERSON were laughing a bit too.  So when its a day when nothing goes your way or having bad luck, you never know what the day has planned for, in this case its one of the most memorable things I remember that happened that duck season.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

I am really freaking bored!"" @CAPS explained as all of us relaxed next too his dark blue @CAPS which was gracefully parked right out side of my house. The @ORGANIZATION was young and as young boys we needed something to do. Gears started to turn in my head! As i thought of a bullet proof plan that would be very funny.  ""@CAPS I've got it!"" I yelped. ""@CAPS here it, I'm really down for anything right @CAPS,"" @CAPS quickly replied. ""@CAPS since @CAPS has car he can drive into town and buy some cheap saran rap then @CAPS back to the four way intersection right out side of my neighborhood and tie the rap around two of the trees on opposite sides of the street so cars will speed through it!"" I quick explained as i ran out of breath. Bursts of loud laughter came from all directions were my friends were standing as I came to realization that this idea was golden. ""I will drive and go get it, but does anyone got some money too pitch in!"" @CAPS pounced as @LOCATION, @CAPS and I, handed single bills to him.  "" that's plenty! give me a few minutes then we can meet at the intersection right out side of @CAPS's neighborhood."" @CAPS said as he brushed everyone off his car and begin to dip out of my neighborhood. ""@CAPS text me when you're about to get back!"" I screamed to @CAPS as sound of his poorly maintained engine bellowed in the @TIME sky. Minutes flew by and the rest of us just sat down on the curb, talked, and waited for @CAPS. Ring ting my custom ring tone for incoming texts sounded. My eyes quickly scanned the phone's contents and concluded that @CAPS was ready with the saran rap at the four way intersection.  ""@CAPS on @CAPS @CAPS go! @CAPS is ready and so @CAPS do this thing"" I muttered as i grabbed my jacket and headed for the exit of my neighborhood. @CAPS trailed, as @PERSON and @PERSON brought up the back. i yelled once again to enhance the passe. @CAPS's car lights lit up the @ORGANIZATION air as he made a blinking signal to express where he was to us. All four of us quickly jogged over to the drive way of a house that was for sale right near the exit of my neighborhood to where @CAPS was parked. ""@CAPS you @CAPS long enough,"" @CAPS explained. ""well we are all here! so @CAPS go to the intersection and set this up!"" @PERSON explained as the started too lead toward the intersection which was about fifty yards away. As we reached the intersection there were no cars! We all @CAPS to this opportunity and @NUM and @PERSON look out for cars!"" i yelled as @CAPS and i began the process. Quickly i opened the saran rap and ran crossed the road, uncoiling the rap as i went. Soon as @CAPS and I were both on opposite sides of the street we both started to firmly rap the saran around trees we have already pick out. Once i pulled and inspected it finding that it was prefect i sprinted to a short fence that was a boarder for the neighborhood on one side of the intersection. i was guessing this was where all my friends were hiding. ""haha this is prefect! i am made sure everything feels right!"" I explained as we all gazed upon delicately hung rap than ran from both sides of the two way street. ""@CAPS we must wait,"" @PERSON said as anticipation fell into place. Four heads bobbed up and down as we checked to see if cars were driving down the road. Since it was about @NUM pm most of the good folk of @LOCATION were sleeping or inside. But suddenly a car came out of @CAPS were, speeding and only @NUM yards from the great prank. ""@CAPS,"" i yelled as the car continued driving closer and closer. Boom! The car speed through the saran rap, then came to a screeching stop. Laughter burst out as the inspected target was completely in disarray. But the anger male driver hearing our laughing decided too leave his car and chase us! ""@CAPS up,"" I screamed! We all @CAPS right as the man reached the fence where we were hiding. Although it was too late for @CAPS! The anger man caught him as the rest of us all high tailed it for my house. As soon as we reached my house we all began too ask our self's what happened too @CAPS! Suddenly out of @CAPS where @CAPS came running, as he @CAPS reached us we started too burst into laughter once again! The whole left side of @CAPS was dripping with soda! @CAPS would never tell us what happened that @ORGANIZATION although we could have guessed!

12276,20746,8," In many relationships I have had, there has always been laughter, love, sadness, anger and complacations. Allthough there has been one person I had a relationship with that did not involve laughter and it was reather boring and sad. I would spend troumendous hours of my time to just get one little giggle or sound of laughter out of him. He was a rather gental soul and could never harm a fly, but still could not laugh eventhough he was happy. I would ask many times over and over ""are you sure your happy because you dont seem like it? I never see you smiling or laughing all I see is a frown"" I told him with a sour face and he replyed back ""yes, @CAPS I am happy but just becuase I don't laugh doesn't mean I am not and besides with that silly grin on your face, how could I not be happy?"" with that reply I simply just shrugged and began again. ""then why cant you not laugh?"" and he replyed back in a drowsy voice because he was gettig tired of the same topic everyday. ""its not that I can't laugh its that I choose not to"" and I said ""well why on earth would you do that?"" he sighed and huffed really getting tired of the topic. ""allright if you don't stop this"" he said in a gental but strained voice, ""im going to have to stop being so nice to you and I just might not talk to you for the rest of the year"" but of course he was only joking, he could never not be nice to me and besides he was my bestfriend he couldn't not talk to me. The topic was dropped and never brought up again until the @DATE I saw him. It was a cold @DATE when I walked out of my house one morning to go to school. I saw a big moving rental truck outside of his house and instandtly knew that he had not lied to me but rather did not tell me that he was moving away. I began to think that it was because of me always asking him why he would not laugh but that would be a silly reason to leave. I went over to his house not caring if I was late or never did show up for school that @DATE, I had to figure out why he was leaving. Once I got to the porch of his house he was walking to the door and I blocked the door way so that he could not go any further making sure that if he wanted to get the box of clothes to the truck that he would have to answer me. I asked him and he said, ""my father got a promotion at work and now we have to move to new york"". I begain to cry as he told me this, I was young about eight years of age and he was twellve. I knew I was not going to get to see him again so I made sure that before I lefted to school that we would hang out before he lefted. That night at the park he told me willingly without me asking him. ""@CAPS, I know you have always wondered why I dont luagh"" he said and went on ""like I said its not that I cant laugh its that I dont want to...I just...when I was young I was teased because of my smile"". I didnt understand, why would anyone tease him? so I asked ""why though? why would someone tease you, your nice"" and he repled ""because before my new teeth grew in my old ones didn't look so great"". And once again I was still puzzled his teeth looked good to me so I asked again ""then why don't you smile now your teeth look fine to me"" he said ""I would but I don't know after being teased for so many years I just didn't feel the need to and now well...I could smile and truth be told I want to"" I said ""really!?"" with too much excitment. ""yes, and the only reason is you, your about the only person that makes me want to smile, its because of that grin you always have your always so happy. I just couldnt admit it to myself well becasue your a girl and to me I guess having a girl make me want to amile and being my only friend that is younger than me makes me feel a little weak."" I didnt understand this at the time but now that I am older I do and I am so glad that I had that one night to see his smile and many phone calls to hear his laughter. I once heard that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and quite frankly it is absoultyl true becuase after that night our friendship grew even further with just a phone call a @DATE and a little laughter.",17,16,0.0,33,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.0
12277,20747,8," These days you don't really need a reason to laugh. Laughter just radiates out of some people as frequent as a breath of air. I believe that everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they enjoy being around. One of the people I enjoy being around most is my best friend @PERSON. No matter what the situation, whenever we are around each other we end up having fun. Laughter can turn a bad day completely around. One of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago. One of my, ""friends"", tried to play a cruel joke on me that ended up being a bigger mistake than she could have imagined. Once I had figured out that this person whom I once trusted was trying to spite me I became overwhelmed with my emotions. At one point I actually considered attacking this girl right in the middle of every one in school. Thankfully I used my better judgment to run away from her, and hide instead of hurt her. Half of the class period progressed and I was still very upset and unprepared to confront her. So there I stayed safe in hiding until my best friend found me. @PERSON had come to comfort me after she got wind of what happened. She talked to me until I calmed down and my tears stopped. She made me feel much better. Her just being there for me, and being able to remonis in the fun times we had together and the laughs we shared, seemed to make all my problems disappear. Eventually she convinced me to go talk to my,""friend"", who as it turns out was ashamed of herself for her actions. We were able to make up and return to a somewhat normal life. To this day and more than likely for the rest of my life I will believe that laughter is the best medicine. I guess I'm lucky in that I have found the best person in life for me to share all of my laughter with. Every body has to have a somebody.",18,20,0.0,38,0.0,0.0,0.0,38.0

I mean what is a friendship if there isnt those moments where you laugh until you pee. When you laugh until you can't breath and you feel like you have just done one hundred sit-ups. Ofcourse you @MONTH meet a friend like this and it @MONTH happen when you least expect it. I didnt expect a new friendship but in a new town and with new people i met the friend i now call bestfriend.  It was the year of @NUM and i was new to @ORGANIZATION. In homeroom everyone stared at me like i was some kind of criminal and everyone talked behind my back when i would pass by their desks, well atleast thats how i felt. My homeroom teacher @PERSON @CAPS me my so called schedule. Sixth period, @CAPS class with @PERSON. What? @CAPS, what is that. I really had no idea what a @CAPS was until i walked into that class. I turned the rusty knob of the door to the gym where my class was supposed to be. I walked in and well there I found out what a @CAPS was. It was a one wheeled bike. Wow! I laughed thinking how did i not know that.  I looked around and saw that i was the only sixth grader around. I took a seat and looked everywhere trying to figure out if i was really the only sixth grader there, when in walked a girl that looked about my age. She took a seat and i wondered if she was nice so i could go talk to her, but i was to emberrassed to. @PERSON asked everyone to get in groups of two and i asked the girl if she wanted to be my partner. We started to useb the unicycles and our partner had to help us get on and ride until we could ride with no help. Class was over and i tolde her my name was @PERSON and she told me her name was @CAPS. I was super excited to go to class next time because i now actually had a ""friend"" well atleast someone i talked to. I went into the class and she was absent so I was a loner that period. I had to be partners with this other girl named savannah witch was a total girly girl. She didnt want to ride the @CAPS, all she wanted to was talk. I was sick and tired of her by the end of the day and I had'nt practiced my unicycleing.  I was really hoping @CAPS would show up to class the next day, and she showed up. This time we had to get with our partner and make a routine to a song that we wanted so we were pretty stoked. We started practicing and trying to come up with something when suddenly we both fall. We stared at eachother and just started laughing and laughing i couldnt breath and she almost peed. It was one of the best times i had experianced that year, and i felt like me and her could become the best of friends.  We are now really close friends and just that one moment of laughter together brought us close at heart. We love to laugh we believe that the more you laugh the younger you look and well i think its true. everyone has their own story about how they met a certain person and how they became so close. I believe that in every friendship what braught it together was a smile or laughter. A laughing moment where you laughed so hard you farted and milk came out of your friends nose. Its a great time and you never forget it, its something that is so simple but so special and it really marks your heart and the way you feel around that person. It braught my friendship with a person i had barley met into a friendship that is now insepreable and amazing. ",19,17,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12279,20751,8,"  It was a normal bright and warm @DATE day, going into my fifth grade year. My older sister and I had been playing all day with my other neighbors that were around our age. One of those neighbors happened to be a boy. We could not find anything to do. It was too hot out to just go walk around in the sun, so we decided that it would be cool to play in the shade with the new slingshot my @CAPS had made. He made it out of an old swing set seat and I thought my neighbor would really enjoy it.  We all headed into our garage to get it. My sister offered to get it down for me since she was taller and it was hanging up pretty high, but I refused. It was my idea to show him so I would be the one to get it. As I was in total concentration, stretching and reaching to grab it, I noticed everyone around me giggling. My concentration got weaker as I begun to wonder what they were all laughing at. I stood there confused for a minute before I had found out what happened. My sister pulled down my pants.. in front of our boy neighbor. I picked my pants up off the ground, looked straight at my sister, and started beating her with my flimsy loose fists. I ran straight to my room, crying all the way there.   My sister came in a few moments later trying to bribe me out from under the covers with the last two fruit role ups. She sat on my bed waiting for a half an hour, I didn't budge. She did not say anything but I could feel her eyes piercing me through the sheets. Later that night I finally came out. My sister kept on apologizing but it didn't matter to me because I was upset with her, that's all that mattered. The whole next day passed and nothing had changed. She was still apologizing and I was still in the ignoring mood. My @CAPS came up to me and told me that she was terribly sorry and upset too because I was not talking to her. I thought in my head, "" how could she be upset.."" but I realized I had not treated her right, even though I wasn't happy with her.   After hearing what my @CAPS had said, I decided that it wasn't worth it. I went and talked to my sister for the first time in days. She told me that she didn't mean to hurt my feelings, she was just messing around. After talking about it for a while I concluded that I got so upset because she did it in front of our friend. We joke around like that all the time, but it's never in front of anyone besides family. I was scared that it would have frightened our neighbor friend away, but he was back to play in a few days so I had nothing to be mad about.   Even though I was embarrassed, I admitted that it was pretty funny. We had a good laugh about it and were no longer enemies. I learned that dwelling over the past gets you nowhere and you have to learn to laugh things off. Ever since then, every time it is brought up, we laugh so hard tears role down our face. I would not have considered it a good thing when it happened, but I do now. It is another memory that my sister and I share and can reminisce about.

12280,20754,8,"Making someone laugh is the best feeling to their soul, and it is one step closer to internal happiness. People might say that when feeling something good inside the body its when they know that they have done something right. I agree with this because it has happen to me; I was feeling down about something that I cant even remember but, when I felt the need to help someone do something I knew inside of me that I did something very special at that moment. It's amazing how you make someone laugh, and it doesn't matter where you are, you also feel happy. The one person in my life that has a great sense of humor is my mother. She is always in need of something funny.People enjoy laughing so much that it is if they were to take some sort of energy drink to make them not want to stop laughing. I hear people say that laughter is very healthy for a human soul, and it will also make the soul and body last longer. Laughter is a way of expressing yourself without having to say much. It could be a great way to start a conversation with a person. Positive thinking leads to making good choices especially if happiness leads you on in life. By making someone laugh it makes the awkwardness go away. It is better to laugh then to be sad.Everyone has their addiction to something in which they need to depend on. My mom's addiction is laughing. She laughs at work and she especially laughs at the house whenever I'm around. Although, sometimes she feels down whenever something goes wrong. I hate seeing her like this, because it then makes me feel down. When she is feeling sad it is if there is nothing in the world that would make her cheer up. If one person is feeling depress, that feeling passes on to the next person closest to them. Eventually I get tiered of seeing my mom like this and in this situation I cant help it but to get up and start doing some ridiculous stuff to cheer her up. Some things that pop into my mind is that I can start dancing funny or tell a little lie that might of happen at school that I think will cheer her up. When there is an opportunity to make someone laugh I enjoy to put a smile on their face.My mom means the world to me just as I mean the world to her. We try to help each other in any way as possible. This one day she came home from work and my dad was sitting in the table reading the newspaper and my mom walks in, and notices that my dad hasn't made food yet she started to flip out on him. She thought that it was stupid of him to not make dinner for us. She was pretty angry at him for a period of time, so she started to make us dinner but she was doing it all wrong. She was mixing the spices in the wrong pan, I was going to let her know that she was doing it all wrong, but my dad was holding me back so that I wouldn't get her more angry. She finally finish cooking and served us our plates but we didn't wanted to eat it because she made the food out of anger and made it smell funky. My dad forced us to eat it because he thought that by eating the food it would make her happy, but he was wrong it only made her feel worse because my youngest brother didn't like it. I felt bad so I had to do something funny that was going to put her in the mood to not be mad at my dad anymore. I turn on the @CAPS and changed the @CAPS to the music @CAPS and started to dance as if I were to have ants in my pants. Her lungs were about to burst because she was laughing so hard, and eventually she was in a good mood for the rest of the day.Everywhere I go I see people smiling and laughing about something and it only makes me wonder about the funny things that are being said. I think that it is a good thing for someone to feel good about themselves because it brings a positive feeling in the room. I enjoy to see people be happy because it always makes me feel happy. What better way to be happy when smiling is one step closer to laughing. My mom and I like to take walks just so that we wouldn't feel apart and stay closer to each other, we see different people each time we go walking and we always get a smile from them.

For all the tears I have cried and all the pain I've been through there has always been a laugh to top the sadness. some time I to sit and pander my life, although i have not lived long and my real experiences are yet to come, I have been through a great deal in my short experiences, but it does not trouble me, for i have taken in what has happened during my time period and I have learned a great deal form it. I've learned that no matter how hard you try you can never fully plain your life theirs always going to be something or someone unexpected, all you can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Its not hard to be happy, just keep an open mind and a light heart, and soon you will find yourself laughing with the rest of the world and enjoying your short time on this amazing planet we call @LOCATION, so listen to your mother and father or even the person you look up to most in life.  There are many things that keep me going, like my boyfriend or my love for animals, but the most important thing i can think of isn't just one thing its a collection of things, such as love, laughter, new beginnings and old endings, a bright and new path (all you have to do is take it) , the relentlessness of the universe, and the idea that there @MONTH be other planets out there that sustain life, maybe even intelligent life. Its easy to find things to live for and even easier to find things to die for, hopefully you look for things to live for. I remember when it was hard and I thought I would never ever be happy and I felt like I wasn't right for this world and its many confusing aspects. I was at the end of my path or so I was making it out to be, but then something happened as I sat on the side of an old road. I looked up at the stars and thought what would i miss out on if I ended my path now, what would I dare to name my child or children for that matter if I even have the chance to produce any.Who would I marry if i marry, will our love last or fade like morning due. so I finally decided that there was to much i would not experience if I ended it this soon. after that fateful evening I went about my life slowly molding into a better person who wanted a bright future with a romantically new but burning love story to tell to my child or children, and with devotion, trust,and respect would hopefully last. but that's not all I would want my adventure to consist of. I would want to find peace of mind in a place where silence is a scarcity, I want to help bring out the possibility of sharing the world with animals not pushing them aside or abusing their natural right to be on this @LOCATION along side us, I want to solve the pollution problem that we humans have more then helped produce. i suppose in my small way i will because in just one person and a every small thing on this very big home of ours, but as small as I am what i do or say will make an impact. so if I want something to look back and laugh on i had bettered to what i consider my part and making this planet a shared and healthy planet.",18,16,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12283,20757,8,"A true story about how two close friends became friends over the joy of laughter. One year their is a boy named @PERSON who wanted to so something fun this @DATE ins ted of just staying in his room and playing video games all day. So he heard of a play called""@CAPS In @LOCATION"" from a friend and found out if he could join and help out with the play, but he ended up getting a part of the play and helped back stage when ever he could. @PERSON found that he enjoyed the doing the play very much and made a lot of friends. At the some time when @PERSON was having fun their was a girl named @ORGANIZATION who didn't talk much to @PERSON at all, but she liked him and she didn't tell a whole lot of people. @ORGANIZATION also tried to make as many friends as she could when doing the plays and spent as much time with her friends as she could. As the play stared to end @PERSON stared to hang out with @PERSON who is @ORGANIZATION older brother and stared to pay a little more attention to her and found out from her brother that she liked @PERSON, but @PERSON already knew that she did like him from the way she acted around @PERSON. @PERSON joined another play called""@CAPS in @LOCATION"" after doing""@CAPS In @LOCATION"" because of how much fun he had in doing the first play. @PERSON found he already knew most of the people form doing the first play. So he stared talking to the rest of the people that was their that @PERSON didn't knew already. This is when @PERSON and @ORGANIZATION stared talking to each other and both of them found that they enjoyed each others laughter they became vary close friends. they became such close friends vary fast because of how @PERSON like to make friends vary easy and @ORGANIZATION doesn't have vary many friends or close friends or it could have been the fact that @ORGANIZATION liked him so much. @ORGANIZATION didn't have vary many friends because the kids at school would make fun of her for being so smart and then she go home schooled and lost some of her only friends that she had. @PERSON soon found out in their friendship @ORGANIZATION was scared of of @PERSON not wanting to be her friend because of all the friends she had already lost. By the time that the play was starting to come to an end @PERSON had already noticed that @ORGANIZATION had liked @PERSON before they were friends and he asked her if she did like him she said no at first, but then she felt bad for lining to him and told him the truth about how she did like him and how she thought that is would be best if they just stay as friends. Both of them knew that they could only be friends because of their age difference. @PERSON was @NUM and @ORGANIZATION was @NUM. So they both knew that it would have never have worked out because of their age. So they both agreed that is would be best if they just stay as friends. As the play was ending the used every minute of it to grow their friendship. By the end of the play they both have became close friends and enjoyed the the good times that they had together and also enjoyed the laughter of one another.  Even after the play both of them still talked when ever they had the time to talk to each other, but they didn't get to see each much of each other. When they had the time to talk they talked about the good times that they had with one another and how much fun they had. They also talked about the great and fun that they had in doing the plays. Both of them agreed that they would do the plays again next @DATE and looked forward to seeing each other next @DATE and how many great thing that they will have to talk about. End the end I think that @PERSON and @ORGANIZATION are going the be friends for a long time. maybe when they get older they could be more then friends and have their friendship go to the next level......... only time will tell.",15,18,0.0,33,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.0
12284,20758,8," I never thought that laughing can help you start a conversation with someone you don't even know. But @CAPS can. Just by laughing with someone can get you to meet a new person. One of the things I do first @CAPS someone is trying to be funny is laugh. Once you know @CAPS the other person is talking about, you forget that you are just getting to know that person. This happened to me once. @CAPS happened in @LOCATION, where my family and I usually go every year in @DATE. I made a great friend and the first thing we did was laugh. As you know, @LOCATION is a hot place and the sun is usually out every day. I spend the days we stay over there going out to walk with my sister and cousins or going to the beach with all my family. I remember @CAPS was a day that my cousins, sister and I went to a small store that's right down the street from where we stay at. We wanted to buy candy and other stuff to bring with us @CAPS we returned to our home. I didn't expect to see one of my cousins there with his friends. @CAPS I saw them, the only thing they were doing was laughing about something. I couldn't hear them but once we got closer, I heard a hilarious thing they said. I couldn't help overhearing so I started to laugh. One of his friends saw me laughing and he thought I was laughing at him. He asked me if I was laughing at him and of course I said no. I told him I had accidentally overheard his conversation so then he started to laugh. ""That was funny wasn't @CAPS"" he told me laughing. ""@CAPS @CAPS was. I didn't know you made jokes like that"" I replied.  He kept on talking to me and then he said, ""I always talk like that so don't be afraid. I don't say @CAPS to hurt anyone.""  I thought @CAPS was nice for him to clear that out but I already knew people in @LOCATION talk like that. We kept on talking @CAPS I started to laugh again. ""@CAPS did I say now?"" he asked. ""@CAPS. I was just remembering @CAPS you said in the beginning. That was really funny"" I replied. For some reason I couldn't forget of @CAPS he said and I don't think I will ever forget. I think @CAPS was probably because the way we met was really surprising to me. I had never met a person, especially a guy, by laughing first. I guess I thought @CAPS was a great way to start a conversation. Laughing with the person will let them know that we are interested in their subject and we understand them. That's at least @CAPS I thought. I had a good conversation with my new friend. We talked about how I was taking my vacations. I told him that every year I go and I always enjoy them. My family and I have a great time spending time with my grandparent and cousins from @LOCATION. I told him I sometimes say I would rather live in @LOCATION than where I live know because @CAPS's so much calmer there. He agreed with me on one part of @CAPS I had told him because he knows @CAPS @CAPS's like to live in @LOCATION, but he doesn't know how I's like to live in any other place. After he told me that, he stayed quiet for a couple of seconds. I noticed something instantly. I had noticed that our conversation wasn't like in the beginning. In the beginning, we wouldn't stop laughing and we had interesting stuff to say. Then, @CAPS got calmer and a little unusual. I didn't want to just stop our conversation there so I asked him where was he going to go because @CAPS I started talking to him, he was with one of my cousins and I was with my other cousins. Now we started laughing again. This time @CAPS was because we just had noticed that the people we were with had left us. ""@CAPS did they leave?"" he asked me. ""I don't know, but they can't be that far because we haven't been talking for a long time,"" I told him. We walked together to go and look for them and I was right. They weren't that far. They were still looking for things to buy and I don't think they noticed we were missing. We just got together with them and acted as if @CAPS had happened. @CAPS was strange for me because whenever I looked at him, I would remember our conversation. The first thing that would come to my mind was that we started our conversation by laughing at a funny thing he said. I actually liked making a new friend this way. Now, whenever I go to @LOCATION, I know I have a new friend over there and if I decide to, I can make other friends by simply laughing with them in their conversations.",23,18,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12285,20759,8," As I waited in the car, anxious to meet my best friend and man I'm in love with, I started to laugh. Not because something my mother or brother said was funny, or because I saw something funny, but I was nervous. I'd talked to him countless times on the phone, many many text messages, and countless emails. But I was still nervous. I knew him better than I knew most people, yet my anxiety seemed to be making me lose my sanity.  As our black rental sedan pulled up to where he was waiting outside of where his family lived, I got more nervous. @CAPS if he wasn't actually the way I thought he was? @CAPS if he didn't like me? @CAPS if I didn't like him? As soon as he stepped into the car, smiling brightly at me, my nervous laughter and my anxiety all melted away. I smiled back. ""@CAPS, @PERSON,"" he said. ""@CAPS @PERSON,"" I said, butterflies in my stomach. I was smiling broadly still, he reached out and cautiously took my hand.  ""@CAPS was the drive?"" he asked, lightly squeezing my hand. ""@CAPS, and nerve wracking,"" I replied, nervous laughter bubbling up again. ""@CAPS your here now, and I'm very happy @CAPS are,"" he said, smiling. And for the rest of the car ride to the restaurant our conversation flowed so smoothly I thought I was dreaming. Here him and I were two guys in love with one another, a new thing for both of us, and we were happy as can be. The whole car ride we held hands ad talked, I felt like I'd known him my whole life. Not just the year and a half I'd known him.  We arrived at @ORGANIZATION all too fast and all of us got out of the car, I was famished and so was he. But we had to wait for a table for a half-hour before we sat down. Once at the dinner table my mother, who was very happy I found someone I loved so much and knew of our love, started regaling us with tales of my childhood. It was one of the most embarassing moments of my life. I was bright red for almost the entire time she told these stories. Some of which I remembered, others I did not. @PERSON laughed and joked wth me about all of them. Which made my nervous laughter come out as actual laughter. It also helped that he was holding my hand under the table.  After we ate dinner and dessert we went to the nearby mall for some shopping and to just hang out. My mom and brother went one way, and @PERSON and I went another. We bought some clothes together and finally ended up in a book store. My favorite book store, @ORGANIZATION's. Back in my favorite section, young adult fiction, I noticed @PERSON staring at me. ""@CAPS?"" I asked stupidly. He smiled deviously.  ""@CAPS just look very... In your element,"" he smirked.  ""@CAPS?"" I said, in mock confusion. He just smiled and took my hand in his again. ""@CAPS problem,"" he said, squeezing my hand. He pulled me closer to him, we were the only people in this area of the store. ""@CAPS if I'm a little forward?"" he asked. I shook my head @CAPS. He leaned in and kissed me very gently on the lips, I blushed a bright red and started to giggle after our lips parted. He quirked an eyebrow, I knew @CAPS he was thinking just by the look on his face.  ""That felt fantastic,"" I said, putting my fingers on my lips. I had a silly grin on my face.  ""@CAPS,"" he simply said, kissing me again. ""I love your laugh, love,"" he told me, I was on cloud nine, I was truly in love with somebody and I felt great! I'd never been this happy before. Except maybe the first time I went to @ORGANIZATION. But this was definitely better, because it could last much longer. Which it has, since we've been together ever since. Both our gazes fixed our future together. Now whenever I remember that I was start to giggle happily to myself. Yes I get a stare every once in a while, but I don't care. Laughter is the thing that helped bridge the gap between him and I. Making us the closest we've ever been.",23,24,0.0,47,0.0,0.0,0.0,47.0
12286,20760,8," Fourth period, freshman year was the highlight of my entire freshman year. @LOCATION was what most people called him, but I simply called him, @CAPS. So I'll start off with the first semester of ninth grade with physical science, fourth period. I had the first term with my best friend, @PERSON, @CAPS we got to choose our seats, so we sat next to each other in the back, right hand corner of the classroom. We sat there so we could get away with more, like passing notes @CAPS talking during class. So one day, while we were passing the notebook of notes, I most have written something that embarrassed her. So I went to grab something out of my backpack, @CAPS she took advantage of the situation. So next thing I knew, I was being shoved out of my desk, onto my backpack, on my back. The class got quiet, for he was giving us notes @CAPS showing us how to do the assignment. So as we erupted into fits o laughter, I looked at him to see if he was very angry @CAPS if he was going to send us outside of the classroom to talk to us. But all @CAPS did was look at us, shake his head, laugh a little to himself, @CAPS begin talking again. So, we kept laughing, but we were trying to settle down @CAPS stop ourselves from laughing. In the second term, @PERSON was @CAPS in there with me, but I had my friend @CAPS-@CAPS, @CAPS.@CAPS, @CAPS @PERSON. i was even closer to @CAPS then in the first term. So, one day he was teaching us about compounds. So while he was writing down a chart to help us study, he sang out, ""@CAPS play the @CAPS @CAPS!"" @CAPS even seconds later, the class burst with laughter, even he had to stop from writing he was laughing so hard. It took us about ten minutes to settle down @CAPS stop laughing. Another part of the second term that was a fun @CAPS a good laugh was doing some example problems on our own. So one of my classmates, @LOCATION, asked what should we do to tell him we are finished with the problems. So @LOCATION thought for a few moments, @CAPS said, ""@CAPS you finish your problems, cluck like a chicken for me."" @CAPS about five minutes afterwords, people started clucking like chickens. @CAPS with that, my friends brought up the fact that I own chickens. But as more people were finishing their problems, it was getting annoying. It was hilarious at first though. Then there was @CAPS @CAPS. We had just a regular classroom, @CAPS a science @CAPS, so we were unable to do to many experiments. So @CAPS, the other science teacher let us borrow her classroom for an entire school @CAPS, being as her class had an online report to do. @CAPS banned me from using the matches, because his nickname for me was @CAPS-@CAPS. Then on the final day, he broke about @NUM to a dozen glass test tubes. @CAPS this happened, i was almost complete with my packet we had to do for the @CAPS. So I went over to him while he was cleaning up, @CAPS I asked what happened. He told me, my classmate broke a bunch of glass test tubes by dropping them. But he looked at me @CAPS he did so. So @CAPS I looked at him, he started laughing. Which gave his cover away, so i got after him @CAPS told him @CAPS to blame the children for things he did. especially for breaking the test tubes. There was also the one time I went into his @CAPS class to do some homework. My friend wanted me to be there for one day, because she lvoed the class so much. So my guitar lessons teacher allowed me to spend fifth period in that class. So, @CAPS he was done giving notes @CAPS giving the class their assignment for the day. Some friends of @CAPS @CAPS called him over for a question. So I looked up from my drawing. By then he was already over to them. So they asked him if he was a swimmer, he replied he did swim. So then they asked if he shaved his legs because he was a swimmer. I think he got embaressed, so he said to come after class @CAPS ask personal questions. So they just wanted a yes or no, so he explained, for about five minutes, that they shouldn't waste classtime for silly @CAPS personal question about him. I thought the entire time, ""@CAPS doesn't he just say yes or no?"" @CAPS were fun times that I will never forget @CAPS tell the day I die. No class, or science class will ever replace fourth period physical science. Nor any teacher replace @LOCATION, he is @CAPS always will be my favorite teacher. I will forever remember the days of every phsycial science class, because of that one simple teacher.",15,15,30.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12287,20761,8," Sometimes I wonder why people laugh. People laugh when something is funny or when things @CAPS awkward and they aren't sure what else to do. Often people laugh when they @CAPS embarrassed or offended. I, actually, find myself laughing for no reason on occasion. if I can make someone laugh I usually feel very accomplished. I think it personally shows emotions out loud. But, in some cases, you laugh uncontrollably at yourself. Every year, since i moved here six and @DATE, my two cousins and my sisters and I have gone ""cheese ball caroling"" with our grandparents around @CAPS time. Even after my grandpa died in @DATE and my older sister left for college. On the twenty-first of @DATE, we go secret @LOCATION shopping one at a time with one of our grandparents while we make the cheese balls by hand. After all five of us have gone, we wrap the cheese balls and put a ribbon on them while we practice our carols for that evening. We always make a list before we start the caroling. First thing on the list is the people who's houses we @CAPS going to go to that night. Second next to each families name is the number of cheese balls we will be delivering to that specific house. Third is what song we @CAPS going to sing to them. Usually, there is about twenty- five to thirty people on the list. All of which @CAPS family members and really close friends or people from their work. We always have a really good time with it too. No fighting or bickering or anything like that. It's really nice to just be with the family and catch up. Usually, it's been about a year since we have all been together at the same time. Last year was the first year we went caroling with out my older sister. She went off to college the @DATE before, leaving me the oldest grand kid there. At first it didn't seem any different, but as the day went on I could feel it taking it's tole. With her being gone and my grandpa no longer being around made the pressure build uncontrollably. I started to relax a little when we got started and just tried to have fun. My grandma yelled to me to grab the list and add a name. At first, I didn't think anything of it. Later she told us we had to come up with a special song for the family. And that's when it hit me. The name looked and sounded familiar because I used to go to school with a boy with the same last name. That's when I asked her to verify if it was the same family. Sure enough, it was. I had had a crush on this boy since I could remember. We lost contact after I had found out he liked my cousin though. I knew it was going to be extremely awkward to have to sing in front of him, not to mention embarrassing. I remember thinking ""@CAPS great, this is just what I needed. This is going to be awesome."" We did our rounds and everything went very smoothly. We were having tons of fun, making jokes and laughing at absolutely everything. Then it came time to go to ""his"" house. We all choked up. The girls had heard many things about how cute and dream like this boy was so they were all nervous too. We were sitting there in the truck telling ourselves he wont be home, and even if he was it would be fine and we would be fine. I think that was the longest walk to a house with that short of a walk way ever. My grandma rang the door bell and we positioned ourselves to be ready to sing when the door opened. To our dismay, he answered it. We froze! We were like gargoyles gawking at him. He gave us a weird look and said "" @CAPS you going to sing or just stand there?"" with an evil little smile. I did attempt to sing, but nothing came out. That's when the youngest cousin starts singing happy birthday. That was not the song we had planned for this house, and it was not his birthday. In the middle of the second ""happy birthday to you"" we all start cracking up laughing, and I don't mean giggling or a small laugh. We @CAPS all laughing hysterically to the point where we could not breath, and he shut the door.  I know if we would have just stood there it would have made that memory a lot more dreadful, but because we all were laughing, we can look back and laugh at ourselves for it. Laughing is a good way to release inner emotional pressure I realized that night. It's a memory i'm sure we will never forget. I have done something like that on multiple occasions but that was defiantly number one on my list of ""what were you thinking"" moments. I wouldn't change anything about it.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12288,20762,8," Laughter is always the key to complete happiness, all you really have to do is laugh to be happy. I remember back in the @NUM grade, i was the new student and i sure can tell you that i didn't know where anything really was, it was a new school: new bus, new everything. Being the new student is something no one wants to be, you get made fun of alot and sometimes you just dont fit in. Well thats my story, i never fit in.  One day i was walking up the stairs to my class, and it was a bright sunny day, i dont believe there really was any clouds that day. Anyways, as i was walking up the stairs i tripped and fell backwards and my skirt i was wearing flipped up over my head, and of course in that era of time you had to have character underpants. Well i remember everyone pointing and laughing at me A. because i had just fell down, and @CAPS. because i was wearing dora underpants. Therefore, i went the whole day with everyone laughing at me, but to tell you the truth, i laughed right along with them. I honestly thought it was pretty funny, falling down and your underpants show? who doesn't think that's funny? After the fact this girl named @CAPS came up to me and told me im not the only one who wears character underpants.We both laughed as hard as we could that whole day, just remembering the fact that me of all people, I fell down the stairs! Next, being the new kid that could actually be taking embarssing, but for me I have done it a million times, so it really didn't bug me as much as people thought it would. @CAPS and I, became such great friends, we laughed all the time. Like when we went to the park and she fell in the ice cold water, or back to the time where i fell down the stairs. Up to this day we still talk about that, its just something you really don't get over. Not to mentioned it was pretty funny when my charcter underpants showed.  In conclusion, i think when the quote says ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" really is true, you have to have a good laugh before you can go on with your day, its just a known fact. If you dont laugh throughout your day then something is really wrong with you. Just because your getting older doesn't mean you have to throw away your laugh. Laughing is the part of the day where you can do whatever you want. So you tell me what is your funny story?",15,17,0.0,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.0

She made me laugh with everything she said. She was my better half would sum it all up. I still remember when I first seen her in @CAPS. The nickname of the town was @CAPS @CAPS hell because of where it was located, in the middle of nowhere. We met when I was on vacation at @CAPS. My parents had just retired a few months before and were looking for a cozy retirement home away from the big city's and more closer @CAPS the good eastern @LOCATION mountains that seem @CAPS always have snowy tops and beautiful landscapes. We ended up staying there for a week or so in this little trailer that we took with us. That thing was hell on earth, every time we stopped I would have @CAPS set everything up even if we weren't going @CAPS use it. It was a two hour process and after the hundredth time you can see how I would get bored. looking for a great house @CAPS stay in that town was not hard @CAPS come by. They were all amazing homemade houses. Never was a contractor paid @CAPS build these houses because the men of the town made them by hand. They were incredible two story oak made houses that look like they could take a tornado coming out with only scratches. We ended up finding this one house that was so amazing that I wanted @CAPS live there right off the bat, surprisingly my parents wanted it @CAPS. But the sad thing is is that we had @CAPS sell our house first or we wouldn't be able @CAPS afford it, so we put that house on the ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS"" and headed back @CAPS the trailer.  We had another @NUM days or so there and I was officially bored out of my mind. I needed something @CAPS do besides stock the fire and make sure the hot dogs did not burn. I jumped on my dads bike and rode into town ( the trailer park was located about half a mile out of town). I arrived in town @CAPS be very disappointing. It was just as boring riding a bike around town and stopping inside the shop @CAPS make small talk just as sitting by the fire in @NUM degree weather. In my mind it was just another boring vacation but little did I know it was about @CAPS get a lot more fun. I woke up the next day and took my shower and got ready for the day. It seemed like another boring day in hell from what I could tell. @CAPS me fun was doing stuff I normally would not do. But back then @CAPS and places like that just did not cut it because all I did that @DATE was go @CAPS places like this and do nothing so it was expected of me @CAPS be bored. I rode my bike around a corner and I saw a bunch of guys and girls that looked like they just came from fishing or tubing or something fun, so I rode over @CAPS see what was going on. I started talking @CAPS a guy named @CAPS. He told me they just got back from a youth group get together on the snake were they went tubing and cliff jumping. I was in aw. That seemed crazy @CAPS me. Cliff jumping? Tubing? It seemed way @CAPS crazy for a youth group. But I guess that's just how they do things in @CAPS. They just don't go have a picnic they go do crazy stuff that I personally have not done any of the things they were talking about because for one i not crazy and for two I have never had the chance. We kept talking and before they all left they invited me @CAPS go on there nature hike up on top of this mountain. I was more than happy @CAPS oblige seeing as I love hiking.  I woke up in the @TIME feeling all hipped up and ready @CAPS rock. I had my permission slip signed and I was ready for a good ole hike. I jumped on my dads bike and rode into town at five in the @TIME and arrived at the youth administrators house just in time for a protein shake for breakfast ( he offered it @CAPS me I did not ask). We drove @CAPS the mountain and at the base there were around @NUM @CAPS @NUM people all in hiking gear. It surprised me because I was not expecting so many people. That's when I met @LOCATION. She was gorgeous so I was attracted @CAPS her immediately. We began the climb and I began @CAPS talk @CAPS her. We were like two pees in a pod. I couldn't get enough of her and her of me. Her laugh made me extremely happy. She was my other half. All I can remember is her amazing laugh.",19,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

That day was a hot day so my friend and I devised a plan to have fun and stay cool, so my friend and I went to the garage and found the sprinkler, so we decided to put the sprinkler under the trampoline and when u do that it makes the trampoline wet and slippery. My friend and I started jumping on the trampoline and he was starting too jump higher then me and I started losing bounce and he came back down the same time as me, but he had more bounce, which made me bounce a lot higher then I normally could also he weighed more then me. So i came back down and I landed on my back and the angle I was at on the trampoline shot me off. As I was bounced off the trampoline I thought I was gonna get hurt and I had rather gotten a few scratches then landing on a dogs manure, but that's just what happen I landed on a pile of dog manure and it really stunk my shirt up so bad, but after i took my shirt off i started jumping again and i jumped for that whole day about but i don't regret it it because after that everyone had a good laugh including me. so @CAPS story was a part of laughter and how laughter is a great way to have fun and even when it @MONTH have been a bad thing that happen to you, maybe in the end it was funny even though at the time it was not.",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12291,20765,8," @CAPS you ever been scared so much that you couldn't sleep the whole night? Were you with a group of @NUM friends at the time? Telling scary stories can be fun and games until someone gets too afraid and freaks everyone out. It starts out with everyone watching movies and having fun until the parents go up stairs and its time to party. It was called our ""@CAPS @CAPS"" night, we call it ""@CAPS @CAPS"" because, us @CAPS kids, we consider ourselves as @CAPS. Our night involves @NUM antsy @LOCATION, @NUM frightened teenagers, and a house that has said to be ""@CAPS"".  To start this amazing night of terror, the guests had to arrive at first. Everyone reached at my house around @NUM pm. We started out by playing videos games, laughing, having a good time, eating, playing board games. Just your average teenage party. That was, until the parents went upstairs to go to bed. Once they were settled in bed and fast asleep, we brought out the ""@CAPS or @CAPS"" games. I bet you thought we were gonna be immature seedlings and play the unrated version didn't you? Well, fortunately we are the @CAPS kids. Just your normal ""I @CAPS you to run around the house three times"" or ""@CAPS you ever kissed someone?"". Nothing unrated about that. After a while everyone just got bored of playing that redundant game, so we moved on to the next activity we were going to do which was to play sing-star on the @NUM, but @LOCATION brought the wrong cords over so we couldn't hook the console up. Since that didn't turn out as planned, we started to chat and capture pictures of the @CAPS. Since this was our ""@CAPS @CAPS"", it was definitely necessary to take some pictures of all of us together as a @CAPS. For our @CAPS role, it goes like this, I am the father, @PERSON is the mother, @LOCATION is the cat, @PERSON is the @CAPS, @PERSON, @PERSON, @CAPS and @PERSON were my children, @PERSON is my brother, @PERSON is the strange atrocious woman, @PERSON is the sister in-law, and @LOCATION is our cable guy. This is how we all considered each other in the @CAPS, so we all had to wear costumes that fit our personality traits for the photos. It took a while for everyone to concentrate and to stop bickering to each other, but we managed to cooperate and proceed with the photo shoot. After photos, it was time to fulfill our appetites. I ordered pizza ahead of time before my parents went to bed. We got @NUM different large pizzas. Hawaiian, @CAPS @CAPS, @CAPS @CAPS, @CAPS, @CAPS @PERSON, and @CAPS. One by one, we all kept coming back for more. My ""daughter"" (@CAPS) dropped her pizza onto the carpet and left a hulking red stain. We all started to pother. @PERSON got the cleaner, I got the rags, @PERSON got the @CAPS, and @PERSON got the camera. She thought it would be humorous to take pictures while we scrubbed for our life. After the mess was cleaned up, we stopped eating and placed everything else away. Now it was @CAPS movie time. Snuggled up onto the couch with @NUM people all clutched together is the ""right"" way to contemplate a @CAPS movie. The movie we chose was called The @CAPS. Every one sitting on top of every one was fun until someone had to use the bathroom. Then, that's when it all happened... when @PERSON got up to use the bathroom, the @CAPS turned off, all the lights in the house shut down and we kept noticing shadows whisking across our living room walls. @CAPS started to cry, @LOCATION was complaining, @PERSON wouldn't go to the bathroom, and I was freaking out. Since none of the lights would turn back on, we all got in a circle on the carpet and started telling legitimately scary stories. Most of them were genuinely honest, and the others were said to be myths. There was one story that @PERSON portrayed about a possessed @CAPS that had no left leg and would go around terrorizing pedestrians. Well, it just so happened that I had a @LOCATION that had no left leg and when we started telling that story my @LOCATION started to freak out and assail all of my guests. So I grabbed my dog whistle and commanded them to cease, and dismiss. After all of the commotion, my parents never woke up and we all scurried up to my room to continue our discussion of @CAPS stories. During the whole process of the @CAPS, the main lesson was that you can conquer any kind of fear as long as you @CAPS a sense of laughter and friends to back you up with it and that's what happened at the party. We were just hysterical about the whole situation and nobody ever left someone alone by themselves and always comforted them with laughter. By far I would @CAPS to say that was my favorite and most adequately funniest parties I @CAPS ever had.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12292,20766,8," Laughter and exuberance are key elements in any good relationship. Being able to be giddy and joyful with someone close to @CAPS is a sign of comfort. It often can bring people closer and help to solidify their friendships. Your true self is shown in your humor. Two years ago when I was in @PERSON's seventh grade math class at @ORGANIZATION, I was chosen to be in the @ORGANIZATION along with just three other classmates. Being in the @ORGANIZATION simply meant that we would be teaching ourselves @CAPS-@CAPS using only textbooks, while @PERSON would teach the rest of the class an easier, more simple math. The @ORGANIZATION was almost like an elite club. Our other classmates looked upon us with jealousy because we got to sit in the back of the classroom together, never had to do any homework, and were never called upon out of the blue to answer questions in front of the whole class. Being the immature seventh graders that we were, we abused @TIME incredible opportunity that we had. I became fast friends with the three other people in the @ORGANIZATION. Their names were @PERSON, @PERSON, and @CAPS. @PERSON and I were already friends, but it was working together in the @ORGANIZATION that really brought us closer together. I also became close with @ORGANIZATION and @CAPS. To @TIME day, @PERSON is one of my very best friends and I still keep in touch with the other two. We were all very different from each other. @PERSON was caught up in the popular crowd, @CAPS usually hung out with the really smart kids who were into chess and reading books, and @PERSON and I were just normal. However, we all had two important things in common; our sick sense of humor and our intelligence.  We each felt that the work we were teaching ourselves was much too easy. We breezed right through the book and never really had any questions. In doing @CAPS, we always finished our assigned work quickly and had more than half of the class left to just sit there, eat, and goof off. That doesn't necessarily mean that that's the order things played out in. ""@PERSON, I don't feel like doing math @DATE. I'm beat,"" I complained as we walked into @PERSON's room for math right after lunch. ""@CAPS neither,"" she replied. ""I say we just sit there and make it look like we're doing work."" We made our way to the table in the back where @CAPS and @PERSON were already sitting. They had their books, pencils, and spirals out, but sat there with vacant expressions. @PERSON and I joined them in sitting and we all exchanged disgruntled looks. ""@CAPS uh, I was talking to @LOCATION @TIME and he said that we don't have to do any work @DATE. We can just sit here and hang out,"" I lied, not even bothering to hide my smirk. Catching on, @CAPS and @PERSON grinned. @PERSON turned around and pulled a brown paper bag out of her backpack. She began to pull food out of the bag and offered it all up to us. I immediately grabbed the miniature chocolate pie. Midway through eating it, I dipped my finger in the gooey chocolate and wiped a big blob of it on the window behind @CAPS. @PERSON noticed and immediately started to chuckle. ""@CAPS, what's that?!"" she exclaimed, loud enough for everyone in the class to hear. @PERSON and a few classmates glanced over briefly, but got back to the lesson instantly. It really wasn't funny at all, but the four of us dissolved into giggles. ""@CAPS guys, I had @TIME crazy dream @TIME,"" @PERSON said as the laughter died down. ""I went to @TIME @DATE camp thing, and @PERSON was one of the camp counselors. He was wearing khaki pants and a white shirt with blue pinstripes. Oh, and he also had a clipboard!"" We stared at her blankly and then burst out laughing once more. The funny thing about @TIME, was that @PERSON often substituted for our teachers, and he wore that exact outfit each time. But the even funnier thing was that it really wasn't funny at all. We were @CAPS desperate for a good time, we found chocolate blobs on windows and khaki pants to be hilarious. Our laughter died down and we sat there in silence. Suddenly, @CAPS leaned back in his squeaky swivel chair and it immediately broke, dropping him right to the ground. To anyone else, @TIME would have been funny. However, we each sat in silence, staring at one another. It wasn't that we were embarrassed for him or felt sympathy, but simply ironic that obsolete things sent us into fits of giggles, while a substantial, laughable event made us simply sit there. I don't think I'll ever forget the @ORGANIZATION. Though it was a waste of time, we had many good laughs. We @MONTH not have learned a lot about math, but we learned a lot about each other.",25,20,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12293,20767,8,"Many @CAPS to laughter People always say that laughing can have many benefits. The truth, I believe, is that laughter is not always the best thing. Laughing can have many different meanings. When I think of laughter, I think of smiles,happiness, and memories. Although, there is one memory of laughter that does not prove that to be true. ""@CAPS, I really don't wanna be here. I don't know that I can stay here and tell him this,"" I pleaded to @CAPS mother to @CAPS me go back home. ""@CAPS need to do this honey. @CAPS's for the best."" @CAPS that point I had always though @CAPS mother knew best. Now, I wasn't so sure. I sat patiently, trying to hold back tears, waiting for @CAPS father to get back to his house. I knew he was at the bar, and silently thanked him that I had time to think.  I was supposed to go tell him how I felt about him always drinking alcohol. Every time I went over there I saw him either drunk, or on his way there. The truth is, I was scared. I was scared for his health and scared that I was the reason for his drinking. I was getting older and needed to tell him what I thought and how I felt. While distracted by this realization, he came storming through the door. I looked up at @CAPS drunk father and @CAPS heart dropped. I burst out in tears while @CAPS mother held me in her arms. ""@CAPS...@CAPS's alright,"" she soothed. @CAPS father looked at me without any recognition and went into the other room. I walked in the room where he was and watched cautiously at him through the open doorway. He wasn't the man @CAPS mother had once married anymore. He had became a monster.  I couldn't stand @CAPS anymore. I walked into the room where @CAPS mother waited with worry in her eyes. ""@CAPS's go home,"" I said. On the way home I sobbed until @CAPS shirt was streaked with tears. The car ride home was silent and the thoughts and sadness hung thick in the air. I could barely sleep that night. The sun shone down on @CAPS face as I awoke to a new day. I felt confident and ready to go back and confess to @CAPS @CAPS how I've felt all along. We drove back to his house and when we pulled into the drive way, nervousness rushed through me. I wobbled up to the door and knocked. ""@CAPS. Hey."" @CAPS made me upset that @CAPS father was acting as if nothing was wrong. I walked in, with confidence, and asked him to sit down. I was content with the fact that I had caught him in one of this rare moments of not being drunk.  ""@CAPS, we really need to talk. I feel as though @CAPS are making a huge mistake by drinking. I know @CAPS addicted and there are risks with stopping but @CAPS're also endangering @CAPS health!"" I basically screamed at him. I poured out @CAPS heart as a whole new wave of tears rushed over me. By the time I was done @CAPS father sat there with a blank look pasted on his face. He laughed. ""@CAPS mother told @CAPS to tell me this stuff. Don't worry about @CAPS. @CAPS @CAPS doesn't know what she's talking about."" @CAPS jaw dropped as he acted as though this wasn't serious. Anger boiled in me.  ""@CAPS don't even know me! @CAPS don't even care about me!"" I screamed then stormed out. I went into the living room and looked straight at @CAPS mother and somehow she knew exactly that I wanted to leave.  This time the car ride, again, seemed to be filled with silence. Thinking about how laughter is almost always a great thing, I started to cry because, just once, laughing didn't mean happiness. @CAPS meant tears.",20,25,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0

I knew that @CAPS they went into the other room, @CAPS wasn't for some quality time together. They were getting a divorce @CAPS the time to tell me had come. As each of my parents gathered around me, I knew that they were about to say something I wasn't ready to hear. The words ""We are getting a divorce,"" rang in my head like church bells @CAPS a couple is getting married. The happiest sound @CAPS could ever hear. But that was the exact opposite of @CAPS was going on right now. As I looked up into the face of my mother, I could tell she had been crying. Where the blue, gray mixture used to meet @CAPS become one, @CAPS had turned red @CAPS irritated. @CAPS killed me inside to see her crying, @CAPS while this was happening my dad just sat on the couch near me with his head buried in his hands. I could tell that he was thinking that he was so in love @CAPS that @CAPS all just went downhill, leaving him with an intense feeling of resentment @CAPS anger towards my mother. The love of his life, was now his enemy.  At seven I couldn't fully wrap my mind around @CAPS was happening to our family. I got that one parent would move away, that I wouldn't always get tucked into bed at night by a duo of love, I just didn't understand @CAPS this had to happen. My poor little brother. Only four, how could they possibly explain this to him. If I was confused, he had to of been off on another planet. At the thought of my family crumbling before my eyes, I wanted to cry. I wanted to go far, far away from the troubles occurring at home. If a genie had been there to grant my three wishes, I would of used all three of them if I thought there would be a possibility to save my parents relationship.  Crying just seemed so much easier than sitting in the living room listening to my parents say ,""@CAPS's not your fault, don't blame yourself, this is between your father @CAPS I."" @CAPS did they think those statements made @CAPS better? Because @CAPS really didn't help. My parents had fallen out of love with each other, @CAPS the hope I had that they would get back together was diminishing faster than the amount of rain forest left in @LOCATION. Plus, there was still the underlying factor that my home was broken. @CAPS more importantly than my home, my heart. @CAPS was broken @CAPS I didn't think there was enough super glue in the whole world to pull the pieces back together.  Just @CAPS @CAPS felt like the whole world was going to crash down upon me, my mother said something to me that I @CAPS never forget. ""@CAPS @CAPS feel like crying, laugh. Remember all the good times that we spent together as afamily."" One by one, each memory began to flood back into my mind. @CAPS dad jumped into the pile of leaves we had collectively raked. The time @CAPS mom @CAPS I made sugar cookies in the winter that ended up burnt, but still made the whole house feel warm @CAPS familiar. @CAPS especially the wedding that brought the two of them together in matrimony. That sacred bond that only ministers can ensue on people. The one that forever changed their lives @CAPS mine.  I began to laugh, @CAPS then to cry. My parents weren't sure @CAPS to think about my sudden change of emotion. They asked ,""@CAPS's wrong, @CAPS?"" @CAPS I, still thinking that none of these memories would be had again, I then realized something. I realized that even though my family wouldn't be together all the time, that we would still laugh. That @CAPS someone slipped on a piece of paper, @CAPS would be funny. My tears had stopped spewing out of my eyes like a dam in desperate need of repair, @CAPS the realization had finally set in that we would be okay. That with laughter in our lives, @CAPS memories in our hearts, we would survive this.  From then on, i solely believed in that one statement spoken to me by my mother. ""@CAPS @CAPS feel like crying, laugh."" The statement that said to me, @CAPS's okay to be sad, but that as long as @CAPS have laughter in your life, everything @CAPS be alright. In my heart, I applauded my mom for handling that situation so well. If @CAPS had not been for her, I would of kept on with the water works @CAPS never stopped for just a second to think about all the hilarious times we had had together.

12296,20770,8," Laughter is indeed an important part of anyone's day. For whatever reason, humans like to laugh, and they like to make others laugh as well. But that reminds me of a funny story... There was this time that I had to take a writing test. In fact, the test was very much like this one. In fact, it was this one. I had to write about one of four topics. Unfortunately, all four of them were about as vague as they could possibly be, and this made picking one rather challenging. After staring at the screen for a good fifteen minutes or so, I began to silently laugh at my situation: I have to write about one of four things when not a single one was even remotely interesting. For some reason, I found my problematic situation amusing, as I am kind of weird that way. But then it hit me... one of the four topics was about laughter... why not write about myself laughing at the irony of my situation? Yes, all I had to do was tell a true story about a time I laughed, so I used this delightful vagueness to my advantage. The topic did not state that the laugh had to be an actually audible one, nor did it state what kind of laugh it had to be, so I figured a silent laugh at irony would do just as well as an audible laugh at something silly.  So now I had my topic. To make things even more amusing, as I wrote about myself laughing at the fact that I had to write about myself laughing, I began to laugh at how silly the task I was carrying out was. However, I began to worry that whoever is grading these things @MONTH not find this as amusing as I did, which would perhaps hurt my grade. But that possibility served only to make the situation even more ironic, and consequently amusing.  You @MONTH think that I am easily amused, but to that I must say: well, yeah, I kind of am. I can find almost anything amusing, but that, I find, is the beauty of laughter. It is so abstract, that each and every person experiences it in differently. Some people @MONTH find very simple things considerably amusing, but others @MONTH be not so easily amused. These differences are part of why interacting with other people is so enjoyable. As I said before, humans like to laugh, and we like to make other people laugh with us.

I was so hurt I told him I just wanted to be alone and he understood. As he was walking away he slipped and landed in a puddle. The way he fell reminded me of the cartoonSpongebob @CAPS, when @ORGANIZATION slipped on a banana and fell hard. I looked at him and his entire back-side was drenched. His cheeks were cherry-red with embarrassment. I just busted out laughing, I couldn't help @CAPS. He saw that water had gotten all over me, then he started laughing. That was a moment of comfort brought on by laughter. Whenever we had a promblem, we could always laugh @CAPS off. That's actually how I met him. I was hanging out with a couple of my friends and we decided to go see a movie calledStep-@CAPS. There was this one seen where one of the characters said, ""@CAPS @CAPS that was so funny, last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur,"" then other character looked like he was going to cry. I thought that was so funny. After the movie was over my friend @PERSON suggested that we go back to his house.

I laughed so hard I almost went the bathroom on myself. @CAPS and myself were the only ones laughing and we just clicked. If he wasn't funny I can honestly say I would've never been with him.

We had one class together. Which was called @CAPS. Passing each other in the hallway just would make my @DATE. We met in a class that we both didn't care for. I would ask him for help even though I didn't need it just so I could talk to him. We also would see each other at the swimming pool because his brother swam and I did also. I would see him during the @DATE but not very often. Instead of him ""helping"" me we would sit and talk about our lives how they were at school and at home.  First semester is over and he got moved out of the class to another class period. We would still talk at the pool and see each during the school @DATE. He would now give me hugs in the hallway. We started to become really close friends. Talking drew us even closer. Laughing was big part in our conversations. We found out that we have a lot in common. Like hunting, wheeling, foods, favorite dog and our personalities are so much alike, that it seems as if we grew up around each other. @MONTH came around one more month of school. I started to go to his house every once in awhile. He came to mine more often. In the beginning of @DATE strawberry festival came around and I asked him to go with me. He said okay and his parents also went but with my parents. That @DATE was fun and enjoyable. The end of @DATE was finally here, school was out in a @DATE. Summer break was here. The @DATE @DATE of school was fun. It was going to be so nice not to have homework over the @DATE or during the week. All we did the @DATE of school was sign @CAPS books and tell funny stories about the school @CAPS. After school I went to swim practice and after practice he was still at the pool waiting for his brother. We were outside talking and all the sudden out of know where he asked me ""will you go out with me""? I said... yes! He made me one of the happiest girls in the world that @DATE. Today, in @DATE we are still dating. One and only relationship I have ever had. I hope we @DATE. He tells me almost every @DATE that he is going to marry me. He tells me he doesn't know what he would do with out me. I told everyone I swore I was falling in love. Now everyone knows I fell in love. I fell in love at first sight.

12300,20774,8,"When I was younger I liked to go fishing a lot. I always went with my two friends @PERSON and @PERSON.We loved to catch @CAPS, @CAPS head, and sometimes @CAPS. We did a lot of fishing while we were camping. One day when we were fishing for @CAPS head and it was not going very well. It was very cold and it was even snowing. We were about to leave when @PERSON hooked one on his last cast. He yelled t me that he was going to catch this on so I jumped off the four-wheeler and ran over to him. When I saw the fish I thought it was a @CAPS. It was by far the biggest @CAPS head that we have ever seen.  While he was reeling it in he said that it was very strong and I could see that he was having trouble. After a few minutes he started to get the fish by the shore. We all started to relax and think that the day was going to be good now. Right as @PERSON told me to get the net he slipped and fell right in the river and he let go of the pole.At this time I thought we lost a fish and a pole but @PERSON was not thinking straight and he jumped in the water after the pole.   Once @PERSON and I saw him swimming and struggling we decided to jump in and help him catch his fish. The three of us were swimming as fast as we could in the cold water after a pole and I was almost to it. Right as I got about a foot from the pole the fish started to swim faster. While I was trying to get the pole I was not focused on where I was going and I got caught on a tree so it was up to @PERSON and @PERSON to get the pole.  The chase for the floating fishing pole had now gone on for over five minutes and all of us were very far down the river. Now @PERSON was very close to the pole and @PERSON and I were just catching up to him. Suddenly, @PERSON yelled that he got the pole so we all swam to the shore to reel in the fish. At this time we were very happy that we went in the ice cold river to after this fish and we could not wait to get home and dry. After a few minutes @PERSON was still reeling in the huge fish. He said he did not know how he was going to get it to the shore. Once the fish got very close to the shore @PERSON jerked the pole as hard as he could to get it onto the bank but as he pulled the line broke and the fish got away. All of our hard work was not for anything. After that we decided that it was time to just go home and sit by the fire. A lot of people I tell this story think it is funny but personally i don't see anything funny about swimming in the snow to break your fishing line. One good thing is that this was the most memorable day of fishing I had ever had.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

So her mom set up the tent for us on the deck, and after we ate dinner, we grabbed our things and went ouside. She was on the phone with her boyfriend and i was on the phone with mine, and both of them were best friends. @CAPS was like two best friends dating two bestfriends, and we were closer then ever. My boyfriend had to get off the phone because he had work in the @TIME so @CAPS was just @LOCATION on the phone. I started saying really funny things and she just started laughing so hard that she snorted and at the time she was still on the phone with her boyfriend. At this point i was just cracking up with laughfter, @ORGANIZATION started laughing even harder because she saw me laughing and pee'd her self while she was on the phone with her boyfriend. For some reason she forgot that she was on the phone with him and started laughing even more after that happend, so all of this was going on at around one in the @TIME and i was surprised her mom didn't come out and yell at us for being loud. When i looked over and saw that she had pee'd her self i yelled out ""@CAPS my god, @CAPS pee'd your self @ORGANIZATION!"" @CAPS was the most funniest thing, i dont think i have ever laughed so hard in my entire life. So her boyfriend finally got her attention and said ""@CAPS should probably go take care of that,"" and then they got off the phone.

12302,20776,8,"@ORGANIZATION is one of the many joys I love to share with people. I absolutely love to laugh, I don't know where i would be if I didn't laugh. My cousin; @CAPS and I, are usually together for most of the @DATE and the truth is we are not supposed to have energy drinks. @CAPS's dad; @PERSON, gave us a monster to split and that day we were going to @ORGANIZATION in @LOCATION. After about ten minutes of us drinking the whole monster, me being the one who drank most of it, was the one who was staying calm. @CAPS on the other hand, who drank a couple of sips, was going crazy. She was running down the aisles and tripping over her own feet. She almost tipped the cart over with me on the end of it. @ORGANIZATION hysterically for no apparent reason is normal for her. Wendy; @PERSON's wife and my second cousin started to get hungry, so we went to go eat pizza at the @ORGANIZATION cafe that is there. My mom had called me and I was trying to get my phone from my pocket to answer while trying to hold on to my plate of hot pizza. I handed my plate to @CAPS because my plate was slipping from my grip. She was holding her food in her other hand, she felt the bottom of my plate and said it was really hot so she passed it off to @PERSON who wasn't paying attention and he didn't have a good hold on it and my pizza dropped on the floor, pizza side down. It was so embarrassing everybody was looking at us. After that embarrassing moment, @PERSON realized that he forgot the churos, so he told @CAPS to go get them. All three of us realized his mistake as soon as @CAPS left, cause @CAPS is a klutz and we probably jinxed it by saying @CAPS is probably going to drop them"". We were a little surprised that she hadn't dropped them yet, as soon as we thought that and she set them on the table, one of the churos fell off the table and rolled out of the package. We were @ORGANIZATION so hard that we couldn't breathe. @CAPS was so embarrassed by her mistake that she turned bright red. We felt bad for poor @CAPS, but we couldn't help but laugh because of how funny it was. She knew it was funny but she didn't want to laugh at herself. One of the things i usually say is if you can't and aren't willing to laugh at yourself then you aren't having fun. That's why i believe it is so important to laugh cause you gotta learn how to have fun when it is in a situation that you need to laugh at yourself but yet aren't wanting to. That's one of the biggest ways to have fun is by @ORGANIZATION, because you know you made a small silly mistake that you think everyone in the world saw, all you need is to laugh it off. But you wont cause you feel too embarrassed or too ashamed to admit that you made a little mistake. Sometimes it's your job to go over to them, pat them on the back and tell them that everybody makes mistakes, you gotta learn how to be silly in a tough situation, and that nobody is perfect. Tell them to laugh it off, it helps and you will feel better once you realize that when life knocks you down just get back up cause that's what life is all about. That's the only way you can learn from your mistakes and from life as well. Laughter is really important the more you laugh the better you feel and the better you feel the more fun you will have. Laughter fixes everything, it is a bandage for the little things that happen in life.""",18,15,0.0,33,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.0

I could laugh all day long, finding anything @CAPS everything funny in @CAPS world. Laughter is important to me, without it, life would be boring. Sometimes Laughter is good @CAPS comes from the heart. Other times it can be cruel @CAPS mean. I like to avoid the cruel @CAPS mean laughter, @CAPS just stick to the good laughter. When one of my friends is laughing @CAPS smiling, it makes me want to know @CAPS they're laughing about, so I can laugh too.  Birthdays are fun, laughing usually comes with fun. I remember my twelfth @CAPS, I decided to have a party at my house. I wanted it to be very special so I invited my closest friends, @CAPS my cousins. Family always makes everything special. My cousin @CAPS I are pretty close, she was born nine months after me, so we are both the same age for a little while. We always have a good time, both of us acting crazy @CAPS always laughing. For my party my mom made rainbow sherbert punch, it was delicious. Everyone had fun, @CAPS soon the party was over, but, my cousins were not leaving until the next day so we continued the party. I was in the kitchen getting more punch, my cousin came in @CAPS wanted some more too. I poured both of us a glass. ""@CAPS is so good!"" my cousin @PERSON said. ""I know that's why I had my mom make it"" "" @CAPS you wanna hear a joke?"" ""@CAPS."" @PERSON said.

""@CAPS @CAPS, @CAPS you wanna know @CAPS the doctor said?"" ""@CAPS?"" @CAPS @PERSON. ""@CAPS itch it!"" @PERSON had just took a drink of punch when I said @CAPS. She spit the punch out of her mouth while laughing, it got all over me. Usually when someone spits, or spills something on you, you get mad. I started cracking up laughing, @CAPS so did she. ""@CAPS my gosh! That's so gross."" ""@NUM @CAPS I could not stop laughing. The joke was not that funny, it was the punch all over me @CAPS the kitchen. We laughed for at least fifteen minutes before even realizing that both our moms were standing in the kitchen. They were just staring at us wondering @CAPS in the world had happened.  You would think that getting punch spitted at your face, on your @CAPS, would make you mad. @CAPS is why laughter makes ordinary days special. In my case laughter was the shortest distance between @PERSON @CAPS I. It would have to be short for her to get that much punch on me.

12304,20778,8," @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS , @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS, and now even @CAPS ( @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS). Laughter! some say it is the best median. It can brighten a cloudy day, cure a case of the blues, and even sooth a breaking heart.  On the other hand a simple sinker or soft giggle can break a heart to! I have had first hand experience listening to goofy squeals being thrown my way and not because I told a witty joke simply just for siting, siting in my @NUM grade class room and becoming the but of my pears jokes. Before I go on with this story there are a few things @CAPS must know. Let alone that all @NUM graders have a common undeniable erg to bring people down so they can build them self's up. I was a @NUM grader who's weight had reached the point at witch my doctors were telling me ""@CAPS should look in to a weight loss program."" this news alone was crushing my self a steam and my class mates laughter soon brought me to tears. I can recall a particular @CAPS, perhaps one of the worst. I was on the buss and almost home when @NUM girls who i thought were my friends started laughing. Little did I know it was me they were laughing at so I joined in what i thought, and what seamed to be some @CAPS giggling. Suddenly they stopped, looked at me started whispering to each other then one of the girls blurted @CAPS between chuckles ""@CAPS look like a beached wail!"". She said this so @CAPS the whole buss herd and immediately burst in to side spiting laughter. I walked down the same street i walked down every day were the buss dropped me off. That day it seamed more gloomy then ever before. This is the day I decided I was never going to set foot on the buss again! It is encounters with laughter like this that broke my heart but also gave me a strong motivation towards loosing weight and regaining confidence. Days, weeks, months, even years have passed scene that day in the @NUM grade. I'm @NUM pounds lighter, a varsity cheerleader and proved of who I am. The tables have turned for me in many ways. I am no longer the person who gets laughed at because of my weight, but some times i catch my self sometimes mindlessly cracking a joke or two at some one else expense. I can recall just the other day, I was with my best friend at the mall. She spotted this girl who was over weight and immediately started giggling and elbowing me in the side trying to draw my attention to her like she was some freak show. When I saw the girl my first reaction was a hideous @CAPS but just as soon as I did so i felt the same pain I felt when that buss full of my pears laughed at me. I immediately stopped, realizing the pain my laughter could have brought her. My self, I am a very funny person and will do just about any thing for a @CAPS. But when it comes to laughing at people and hurting there feelings this is were i draw the line because i know how it feels to be in there position and i hope that my story helps open the eyes of u and others to the harmful effects some laughter can have. So go ahead and @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS, @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS, and even @CAPS just not at the expense of another persons feelings.",20,18,36.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12305,20779,8," Laughter is a big part of my life and I believe @CAPS have to have laughter in a good and healthy relationship. This is a true story about laughter and it's affects on my life.Laughter is a good thing for your body, mind and soul, it lightens my mood when I'm feeling down. I'm glad to say I have lots of relationships, many of which are blessed with laughter. My mother and I have a good relationship together, and almost any time we're together in the same room there is bound to be laughter. My mother and I laugh all the time, over silly things. We laugh just to laugh and most of the time, we don't even know what we're laughing at. She can make me laugh at the most ridiculous things. I'm also pretty sure she's the only person who can get me to spit my drink all over the dash board just because of a silly face she made.  My mother isn't the only one I can have a good time with. I remember a conversation I had with a good friend of mine, it was about the way people laughed. I told her about how I had noticed that people usually laughed in different vowel sounds, like a, e and o. It seemed odd to me that I had only ever heard people laughing in those vowels and not I and u. She thought the same thing I did, so we came up with this idea to laugh in the vowels I and u. Of course people were too busy with their own lives to notice us laughing oddly, but it was fun all the same. @CAPS never really realize how hard it is to not laugh until the occasion is upon @CAPS. My mom and I were at my aunts house trying desperately not too laugh. We had all decided to do a facial cleansing mask we had seen on @CAPS @CAPS. The mask itself was made out of whisked egg whites and toilet paper. @CAPS dip the toilet paper in the egg whites and plaster it all over your face. @CAPS have to wait at least fifteen minutes or until it's completely dry before @CAPS can take it off, other wise it doesn't work.   The three of us did as the instructions told us, but were dismayed when we saw the final results of our efforts. We weren't upset because we looked repulsive we were upset because we all looked like a bunch of crazy ladies, and we found it exceedingly difficult not to burst into laughter. The site of my mother and aunt was so ridiculously funny I had to leave the room for fifteen minutes so my face could dry. After about fifteen minutes I came back to find my mother and aunt in the bathroom drying each others face with a hair dryer. After seeing this I just couldn't stand it any longer, I started crying with laughter, my mask cracked and all my hard work went down the drain. that day was one of the funniest days of my life, we laughed together so hard our abdomens hurt. I love to laugh as I've said before and I personally have many different forms of laughter. when I laugh really hard I laugh all the air out of my lungs and forget to breathe. What it looks like to others I have no clue but I must be a red faced girl rocking back and forth. Other times I kind of have a manly ha ha but if your lucky @CAPS'll get to hear me snort. The thing I'm trying to say is that laughter is a good thing and it has made a big difference in my life, I don't know what I would do without it. I love to laugh, I think I would die if I couldn't laugh.",20,17,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12306,20781,8," The laughter in me.  To me all you need to do to get through a tough and horrible day is a good @CAPS. It gives you hope throughout the day, and no matter what kind of mood your in, when leaving to work, going to school, or really any activity that involves a ""sigh"" moment. For me I get that feeling about school, but I can always count on my best friend, @PERSON. Everyday she manages to say something totally off topic and we'd end up dying of laughter at the top of the stairs near the science labs were we eat lunch. As people walk by they give us weird looks, we don't care because we understand each other. To me @CAPS is my way of reliving stress.My @CAPS agrees with me her name is @CAPS I call her @ORGANIZATION. We've been best friends since the second grade. She is my rock. She inspires me to do something with my life, something more than working at some fast food restaurant. I hang out a lot at her at her house and we share so many great and fun memories. Its really bad when we are around each other, its like one look at each other and boom!, I'm on the floor not breathing because I'm dying of laughter. I don't know what it is but, its like when we see each other its a rush off all the good times we've spent coming together all at once. Sometimes we @CAPS hysterically over nothing. I doesn't make sense but I guess that doesn't matter when your hanging with your best bud.  Laughter is an important part of my relationship with anyone. Its shows me how fun a person can be and if the have a sense of humor. It shows me that they can smile and not some stuck up want to be perfect robot. All @PERSON and I talk about is boys and boy problems and it makes me @CAPS and giggle, but when we are in our fifth period class forestry and fire we are like caged monkeys in a zoo. It's like we are magically ""high,"" all of a sudden have this out burst of energy. We sit next to sit side by side to one another and we tickle each other and @CAPS really loud. By the end of class I make a paper ball and we play paper soccer ball its fun especially when the teacher gives you dirty looks and tells you to stop and you don't do it. Lets just say that her face turns a very bright red color.Nothing compares to how much I @CAPS when I'm with @ORGANIZATION. When I used to go to @CAPS I had three classes with her @ORGANIZATION, @ORGANIZATION, and @CAPS. We also had lunch together, but anyway as I was saying, I swear we had a not stop @CAPS war everyday. My @CAPS is more like a cackle mixed with giggling. Some people like, some thinks its cute, others think I @CAPS funny( The weird kind of funny). In @ORGANIZATION she'd stand next to me and she'd look at me weird, or said something that didn't come out right, or sang obnoxiously, anything she did cracked me up it was so distracted when she was around but so much fun. I swear I got all of my exercise from @CAPS with her. At home when my family is all together, are way of laughter is mostly picking on one another. It's different than laughter with your friends. We make fun of how my sister @CAPS was supposed to be a boy because everybody thought she was going to be a boy when she was in our mothers stomach. We made fun of my brother for being the only boy out of five kids. We make fun of my sister @PERSON for being the shortest one in our family. I can feel the difference between laughter. It's mostly criticism really.I @CAPS mostly because I feel more alive it gives me something to live for everyday in stead of ""@CAPS great, another day to try to get through, @CAPS...no."" @CAPS for me gets me motivated for the day it's like my drug to get through life. It gives me an easy way in to communicate with others. I thank @CAPS for giving us the ability to @CAPS because without it I would lose my mind and have a hard time making friends.

As I stared at the majestic destruction of the warm, humid air, I felt someone or something watching me from behind. The weight of the sixty pounds of wood started to get heavy as I walked from one side of the house to the other. Finally, I reached the trailer just to be told by @PERSON, my best friends mom, the she didn't think we would need that much wood. I thought to myself the this was going to be a long weekend. After about two hours of packing clothes, food, water, sleeping bags, pillows, and tents we headed out for @ORGANIZATION. It would be about two hours of driving, that felt like twenty minutes. @PERSON, @PERSON, @PERSON, @PERSON, and I were the worst group of people to put into one car. We all yell and fight and punch at each other just for fun. Once we arrived at our destination, we sprung out of the car like a hive of angry bees. I race @PERSON to the @ORGANIZATION. the second we were done unpacking our belongings. The first few days were spent basking in the one hundred degree heat, swimming, and flirting with the random girls we found around the camp site. We slept as little as possible, so that we could enjoy the friendship and just pure fun we were having. During day two, we decided to go mountain biking. We were on those bikes for hours before we noticed the sun was going down. In the moment we all turned and saw the most extravagant view the earth has ever created. There were burst of orange and red. The colors ricochet from cloud to cloud. After hours of riding our bikes in the heat, we chose to go for a swim. As we swam I felt something touching my foot. Then all of a sudden there was a hand on my foot. When I looked down to see who was grabbing me, it was only a stick. As I looked closer, it turned out to be a root system of a fallen tree. It looked fake, as if someone or something had put it there. This though sparked a conversation about @CAPS for the day to come.  The sparks danced together as if they were @CAPS and the @LOCATION. The only light we had was the brilliant glow of the fire. @PERSON was playing a gorgeous melody on his guitar. As I listened and enjoyed the flawlessness of nature, I felt someone watching me from behind. I nudged @PERSON and when we turned around, our hearts stopped. There was a spinning green light, almost twenty feet in the air. I spoke the word everyone was dreading, @CAPS. I had slowly stood up and the light started spinning faster. I quickly grabbed the machete, that was next to me, and approached the light. As I grew closer, I could make out small figured in the @CAPS shadows. Then, an eruption of children laughing came booming from the direction of the light. A little boy emerged, unable to control is laughter, and ran away. After returning to my seat next to the camp fire, I thought about life. What if @CAPS were real and they are watching us. No, there not real. I laughed it off, and continued my week long vacation.",18,15,0.0,33,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.0
12308,20784,8," What makes you laugh? Laughter is a really good stress reliever. There are many different types of laughs around the world, some people's laughs are really high pitched and others @MONTH be very deep and low. Some other people snort and make other animal noises. I know that for me I have many different types of laughs for all the different emotions I feel. When I am upset I have a very distinctive laugh. Although when I am upset I laugh to make myself feel better and have a better day.   One time during a basketball game, I was having a really off night. Fouls were being called on me left and right. Normally when this happens to me, I get really mad and I lose my head and end up being taken out of the game and sitting on the bench. I absolutely hate sitting on the bench. This time when I got a foul called on me after already being threatened to be ejected from the previous game for the same reason. I decided to just smile and laugh about the foul and told myself to shake it off. My coach was very pleased with my change in attitude and just told me to play defense with my feet and to shake the bad call off and keep my head. When you are mad a person can take a lot away from the demonstrative looks you can make, although if you just smile and laugh about it, their reactions will be a lot different. I am not the only one on my basketball team who feels this way. A lot of us just laugh about calls that are made and just shake them off.  I am also a cheerleader. When you are a cheerleader you should always try to have a smile on your face at all times, and make it seem like you are in a happy mood. I play in a basketball game every night before I go out and cheer. I have to do my best to keep my cool while playing so that I'm in a good mood for after my game when I do cheer. Laughing helps me a lot with keeping my cool and relaxing while I am playing, so I'm in a good mood for cheer.  My coach is also very huge on people having positive attitudes. She tells us at practice that if we just smile and laugh about things that go wrong the outcome will be a lot better then if we have bad attitudes about it. I took this in very strongly and it stayed with me. My coach inflenced me to have a better attitude and since that day I have tried to have a positive attitude. I keep my positive attitude by just smiling and laughing when things in my life go wrong.  A laugh can go a really long way. I personally think laughing helps express the mood you are in. Laughing is also good for the body. Laughing can make you feel one hundred times better when you are feeling down in the dumps. I try my hardest to be in a good mood at all times. I really don't like being in a bad mood, it's really not fun. Laughing makes me feel a lot better.  I think that laughing is a very good function for the body. I feel that when I laugh it makes my mood better and the moods of the people around me a lot better. Laughing is a magical feeling that goes through out your body and makes you feel warm inside. I think everyone should laugh at least once a day. It will make your day that much better.",17,20,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0

""@CAPS just doesn't like school"", I would tell his grandma. The thought of school being no fun and not liking it changed drastically for my nephew.  We let him think it was going to be another boring school day, but it was party day for them. Every two weeks if they work hard they get a party, lucky for @CAPS they have been working diligently. The stubborn side of my nephew was showing it's ugly face that morning as @CAPS fought every move we made. When we walked through that narrow door @PERSON did something uncharacteristic, to him and five year old's all over the @LOCATION. @CAPS stood as still and silent as a marble statue. It couldn't have been better prepared! Streamers, balloons, food, party hats, and bags, they went all out for the first one of the year. The aroma made my stomach gurgle with desire. Above all they had desserts, cakes, cookies, pie, all of this cooked thirty feet from you. so you walk through that door and you mouth instantly fills with warm saliva. These children played with a ninja like ability, one moment in front of you, you blink, and just as fast as you blinked they disappeared. It took me an hour at least to find @PERSON in that small room. As I realized though it's easier to sit down and let them find you. As my butt hit the cold, hard, and nearly unbearable surface @PERSON was in front of me. @CAPS had this ear to ear grin on his face that scared me, @CAPS never had that big of a grin on his face unless @CAPS had a plan. @CAPS definitely had a plan, in seconds my face was soaked.  @CAPS had been concealing a squirt gun behind his back, and had the escape route planned out. With the chairs and the short tables how they sat long legs and weaving through them did not go well together. It was extremely difficult to catch up in the room, but once we hit the hallway and I could extend my legs it was an easy run. His ear to ear grin disappeared once I caught him, but the laughter on both sides did not. @CAPS @MONTH have got my face but I got his head! My nephew loves school now. It's almost the end of his first year, and they still party hard, but thanks to us no more squirt guns. I think if we would have waited any longer it would have taken some more work to get him to like school. @PERSON is a very smart, athletic and good child. @CAPS will be just fine in school, plus @CAPS is strong so I pity the child who fights him.",22,20,0.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0

Well I'm sorry because I was not able to answer the prompt either. I cannot remember when the last time I had a really good @CAPS within a couple of years, so I will tell you why laughter is special to me instead. What's so special about laughter? For me laughter helps us in many ways. I will talk about how laughter is good for my health, how everyone's laughs are different and even make us @CAPS at them. Also why laughter is so special to me.  I have always felt this weird feeling in my head after I laughed. I think it's because endorphins are being produced into my brain. If I @CAPS too hard my stomach hurts because laughing also burns calories and works out my abs. I also think it helps all three sides of the health triangle. My social life makes me @CAPS with people. Emotionally laughing makes me happy. Also physical is always funny when you work out with a friend.  I think that everybody's @CAPS is unique in it's own way. I also know that sometimes it's funny to listen to other people chuckle, snort, or sound like a mouse. Our laughs are another thing that just makes us, us!  Laughing to me is special because of all the people who make me @CAPS. My friends are family I have chosen for myself. My family makes me @CAPS and be happy everyday. It's special to me because those people are special to me. Laughing with my father is nothing compared to me laughing with my mother. Laughing with my friends will never compare to me laughing with my significant other.  My life is all about laughter and it's special to me. It's not like chewing a piece of gum. It's a whole other thing. Nothing is more fun then having a girls night and laughing all night, or even going out dancing and having the most romantic night of your life. Laughter is a matter of life.                         So @CAPS, @CAPS, @CAPS.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12311,20790,8," Laughter has been a nonchalant but steady and strong force for me in many relationships. I believe that laughter is useful in getting to know people you've just met and growing closer to people you care about. In my opinion @CAPS brings people closer and can change a bad situation upside down. Getting enough bravery to gain new friends, ask this girl out and eventually develop a good relationship with her, is where laughter played an important role. @CAPS was the @DATE I was fifteen and a sophomore at @ORGANIZATION school. @CAPS was my first year there. I have been to many schools, @LOCATION, @CAPS wood, etc. and like any new school I was having a hard time connecting on a social level with my peers. Everyday I woke up, got ready, went to school, got home did homework (maybe), and went to bed . @CAPS was a boring cycle that I seemed to be trapped in. The image of being cool and trying to fit in did not seem to work so much. Because one thing I realized was that trying to be cool and something you're not only gets you so far. The one thing that kids, people in general, like is when you're real and being yourself . I found that out later on, but I actually didn't realize that's what people liked the most. I said to myself one time that I didn't like trying to act like someone or something because the truth was I actually thought that I was a cool person deep down. So I changed my ways I stopped trying to act cool, and acted like myself. And @CAPS turned out that I actually was cool and that girls actually found me attractive, and not only attractive but a funny person that was likable. My main attribute, well besides my looks was my ability to make people laugh or at least smile. @CAPS gained me many friends that I didn't have in the beginning. @CAPS even gained me one of the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. Her name was @LOCATION, in my eyes there was no girl that could compare to her in any way. She had the body of a coca cola bottle, caramel skin, and the face of a goddess ( and I'm not exaggerating). Like any beautiful girl she had many followers and admirers who were similar to me. So what chance did I have? What did I, @PERSON have to offer her? Laughter. My greatest attribute that had come to my rescue many of times. Even though @CAPS didn't last as long as I would have liked @CAPS( forever) @CAPS was great being with her for as long as I did, the things we got to do and the many experiences we had together, are priceless. And @CAPS was all because of my ability to make her laugh and to put a smile on her face. I believe that without laughter this world would not be the place that @CAPS is today. Sure, there is still crime and many horrors and atrocity's committed today, but imagine how horrid @CAPS would be without laughter. Joy, which I believe is the core of what laughter brings, allows us to forgive and forget. @CAPS allows us to turn our heads and overlook things. Without us being able to laugh how could we expect to survive the future",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12312,20791,8," Laughter @MONTH be the best part of life. It usually expresses the feeling of happiness and joy. The expression almost seems contagious in a way, one laugh that goes hand in hand with a smile could improve someones day drastically. Possibly the best part about laughter is that it is not hard to come by, there are many things in our world that are worthy of laughter. I have personally find myself laughing most when I am around people that I enjoy being with. Some people think the key to happiness @MONTH be love or joy, or possibly being happy with yourself. I think the key is surrounding yourself with the ones you love and care for because everything seems better when they are around. They are comparable to sunshine, everything is better in its presence.  My favorite memory that involved excessive laughter took place on a warm @DATE day at my friend's house just outside of city limits. It must have been around @NUM in the @TIME. The @DATE air was warm, but not overwhelmingly hot. It seemed like the perfect afternoon. My friends and I were hanging out, playing catch with a football, building a fire, and being happy. We had all the components needed to have the best night of our lives. The most vivid memory I have is when we were playing catch, I threw a deep pass to my friend and as he he was running under the ball, he ran straight into a fence. He got up laughing, and the laughter spread. That, you could say, set the tone for the rest of the night. The rest of the @TIME seemed like it could have been straight out of a movie. Everything was going right and we were all feeling good. It was the quintessence of happiness. Laughter was everywhere and smiles stretched across the faces of all of us.

My sister is my other half and we share everything. She makes me laugh and is always there when i need her. I'll always be there for her also. Laughter is an important part of life. @CAPS, my sister and I laugh and play. One day I came off the bus from school, all i could do was cry. As I waited for my sister's bus to arrive, the tears fell down like a river flowing. The bus appeared and a sense of joy appeared with it. @CAPS, it wasnt the bus that brought my joy. It was my sister, right away she could feel my pain and noticed my tears. I could see in her face, the love and care. She asked me whats wrong. I could hear the worry in her voice. My river of tears stopped and I began to speak. I could tell her everything, without trying or holding anything back. The words flowed through my mouth. @CAPS need to think of what to say. I told her what happened without a pause. Afterwards, she told me something I'll never forget. She said,""@CAPS matter whatever happens, I'll always love you."" @CAPS we laughed. It was the sweetest laugh. A chorus of laughter filled the air. Nothing that people say about me is true, so I learned to laugh at it.",15,16,0.0,31,0.0,0.0,0.0,31.0
12314,20793,8," The night was dark and cloudy giving my surroundings a gloomy figure. Shadows slithered across the street by the lamp light of passing cars and pedestrians. My day had been depressing and it seemed that karma was out to get me. Everything that could go wrong; did go wrong. And the rest of my night was only going to get worse. Earlier that day I had upset my girlfriend with a statement that should not have been stated. Resulting in her calling me as soon as I sat down on my bed. The words we exchanged left smoldering wreckage in our wake. Our conversation ended in fury and the disconnection of phones. Once I laid back down in my bed, and my anger diminished, I began to feel an overwhelming sense of guilt.  I said things that were unnecessary and horrible. As I laid on my bed, my heart felt like it was slowing being squeezed by some unseen force. It labored my breathing and soon tears began to fall from my eyes. The guilt and agony crept through my soul like a burglar creeping through a dark house, and stealing whatever valuables I had left. My day had ended in tears and pain. But then my phone rang once more. Quickly I wiped the tears from my face and proceeded to read the caller I.D. I turned out to be my best friend, and so I answered not knowing what @CAPS wanted. @CAPS asked if I wanted to hang out and possibly catch a bite to eat. His words lifted my spirit even if it was only half an inch. When @CAPS pulled into my driveway, I was there waiting for him. I climbed into the passenger's seat and immediately @CAPS knew something was wrong. @CAPS asked me if something had happened and I replied with a one worded answer, ""@PERSON.""  @CAPS knew that it was not the right time to talk about it, and so we drove to the nearest restaurant and found our seats. We both ordered coffee and I began to rip open sugar packets vigorously and dump them into my steaming cup of coffee. @CAPS did the same but with much less force. Then @CAPS cautiously asked me if I wanted to talk about it. I looked up from the mess surrounding my coffee cup and slowly nodded my head. I started to spill out all the events of my day in rapid succession. Bringing a storm of swearing and profane language. My best friend just sat there and listened until my voice grew softer and my fists unclenched. We sat there in silence for a short time while @CAPS chose his words carefully. Then @CAPS decided to change the subject for the time being because @CAPS saw that I was still squeezing my car keys. @CAPS asked how things were with my mother and another storm of curses poured from my mouth. We became silent again and then @CAPS asked me, ""@CAPS you feel better now that you got it all out?"" I looked at him puzzled because it was not the reply I expected. After thinking about it I replied yes. We then enjoyed our dinner, payed, and left. My mood had been lifted, but I was still upset. So we drove down to the river and exited his claustrophobic car. @CAPS and I walked down to the bank and stood there just staring at the water. @CAPS then asked if I wanted to hear a joke, and after a pause I said yes. The joke @CAPS told me probably should not be repeated but it made me laugh so hard I had trouble breathing. His timing was impeccable and it made my mood soar. I have always turned to my friends when I felt down. And there have always been there proving I can count on them.  That day had been a disaster, but the rest of the night turned out to be far better then I had hoped. It is not only the fact that my friends can lift my mood, but it is also important that they make me laugh. Because if your counting on someone to brighten your day, what better way to @CAPS it ten make them laugh. Laughter has always held important meaning in my life. I laugh every day. Mostly because I find the most idiotic things hilarious. I know that laughter will never disappear. I hope that one day when I am old and decrepit, all my wrinkles will be from the countless times I enjoyed a few good laughs with my friends. Because laughter is magical.

12315,20794,8,"  Being with people that can always make you feel comfortable and be yourself around is most likely the best quality in a friend. Everyone has their flaws; a friend can always look past them and find the good in the one that they trust. A friend can tell a joke and make you laugh until you cry. Making someone laugh can always help when they think that it's not possible for their life to get any worse. Laughter is the most valued gift that can be given. You know inside that it's making them happy just from seeing the smile on their face. There have been many times in my life where I have laughed so hard that I cried. There is truly no greater feeling in the world than knowing that you have people in your life that can cheer you up just by doing or even saying something so ridiculous that it just breaks you into a hysterical laughter. I laugh a lot throughout the day. When I don't, people get suspicious and they feel like there's something wrong with me. That's literally how much of a role that laughing plays in my life. Laughing is my second language in life. There has been one time in particular in my life span so far that has made me laugh so hard that I cried tremendously hard. My friends were staying the @TIME at my house and we were just being boys. We did so many things that mad us question our sanity: we at hot sauce by the spoon full, we watched comedy shows, and we also ate ourselves sick. It was the time of a lifetime and we laughed through it all. While watching the comedy shows, we couldn't breath. We were laughing so hard! Nothing could make me stop laughing; I would just keep replaying every joke in my head and I'd start laughing even more. I already hurt so much as it was when we were watching it from earlier. The comedian was a magician with words; the way he put them all together to just seemed like he was reading a sacred scroll from ancient times. I laughed and cried over and over again. I probably did that for ten minutes straight! It was unbelievable. Making these life-long memories with my friends is something that I will never forget. I truly know how great I have it in my life; people would kill to be in my shoes and to get the love and support I get from my friends and family. All my experiences are the things I learn from, whether they're good or bad, I know that its all going to help me later in life to be able to make the right decision when it is presented to me. All the laughs i share with other people makes me know that they have had a good time throughout their day because they smiled and laughed with me. They made a point in my day great as well. Being myself around them is great as well because I know that they're already accepted me into their lives and I don't have to try to be anyone else.  Everyone laughs at some point or another throughout their lives no matter how much they deny it. I really don't even know why they would because what better feeling is there than being able to let out a little giggle every once in a while? I really don't think that there is any. I feel really honored that I have such amazing people in my life that always make it exciting and full of laughter and life. It shouldn't be any other way in my personal opinion.

12316,20795,8," Its always hard to know what to do when a friend or family member comes to you when they are sad or mad. Most of the time you don't know what to do. I have learned that making people laugh with something as simple as a joke can always make them feel better. As I was sitting at home one sunny afternoon, I got a call from my friends @PERSON. When I put the phone to my ear all I could hear was a loud crying. @PERSON wasn't saying anything to me, not one word. Even though, I repeatedly asked her what was wrong with her, @PERSON wouldn't even say a word. Not knowing what to do or say to her anymore, I asked her to calm down and take deep breaths. Desperately, I wanted her to be able to talk to me and tell me what was going on because I had started to get really worry. Couple minutes later, @PERSON started explaining to me what had happen. @PERSON started off by telling me she was irresponsible that she didn't pay attention to what was happening around her. I asked her why she was saying that about herself because I knew she was a responsible person. Finally, @PERSON screamed that while she was home watching the @CAPS basketball team play basketball, her dog @CAPS got run over. The dog had actually died. I found it very ridiculous and pathetic that @PERSON would be crying over her dog. I didn't want to be rude about it and tell her what was going threw my mind at that time. Even thought that was the way I felt about the whole situation. I thought of what the words I needed to say to @PERSON but I was confuse. Actually, it wasn't so much that I was confuse, I was afraid of hurting her feelings with my words. Finally, I decided to tell her not to worry about her dog, that my friend had a couple of dogs for sale. Also, I told @PERSON that if it made her feel any better I would buy her a new puppy. After saying that to her there was an awkward silence. My hands started to get shaky because I thought @PERSON was mad. All of the sudden I just heard her start laughing really loud and once again she couldn't talk. I felt so relief that I had made her laugh and not cry or get mad at me. @PERSON wouldn't shut her mouth she just laughed and laughed and laugh hysterically. Finally, she shut her mouth up and started talking to me again. @PERSON thanked me for making her laugh and making a joke out the situation. Rather than saying depressing words that would make her feel bad and make her cry even more. I was happy I made her laugh because she felt better about herself and not worst. As I was laughing I told her that anytime she needed to laugh I was the person she needed to be call. Anytime, any day and anywhere I would be happy to bring a smile to her face and a loud laugh to her mouth. @PERSON laughed with me and thank me one more time for making her laugh. From that day on I always like to make people laugh because I know I'm going to make them feel better. I sure love it when others make me laugh too. It's just an amazing feeling, a great feeling that everyone loves and cant really describe. After making my friend @PERSON laugh I found out laughter was a key element of life.

Because without @CAPS there would be no happiness or joy in the world. @CAPS are a great source for laughter, @CAPS are the people you go to to be yourself. Some people use laughter for to release pain. For example, whenever @CAPS dad gets hurt he starts laughing. @CAPS @CAPS was in the navy a few years ago. And during training he got hit in the stomach. Nothing really was wrong, but @CAPS did hurt him. so @CAPS @CAPS sat down and started to laugh. I guess this so-called trait is hereditary because I find myself doing the exact same thing from time to time.  When I learned about how laughter heals, @CAPS wasn't too long ago. @CAPS was last @DATE, @CAPS was early @DATE and @CAPS of @DATE was coming close. Traditionally me and @CAPS parents would drive to @ORGANIZATION. And use the money we have been saving up all year round and buy a huge pack of fireworks.  Once @CAPS of @DATE came I was filled with joy, I woke up and immediately run up to @CAPS mom and ask ""@CAPS's @CAPS of @DATE can I take the fireworks out to the package now?"" I was a new puppy discovering its first chew toy. @CAPS shook her head ""@CAPS yet @PERSON, its only eleven in the morning. Sunset doesn't come around till seven or eight"" @CAPS smiled at me. ""@CAPS girl."" @CAPS whispered as @CAPS left the room.  Once the huge golden sun finally went down and the smaller bright shimmering stars appeared. We all knew @CAPS was time. ""@CAPS you like to do the honors?"" @CAPS dad handed me the first firework and a lighter. A big smile appeared onto @CAPS face without @CAPS control. I loved fireworks, I love bright colors watching them as they spewed into the newly lit sky, filling @CAPS with a sea of colorful sparks. After @CAPS of @DATE had ended @CAPS cousin @CAPS came over. @CAPS mom had was little sick but @CAPS wasn't something that was contagious. @CAPS @CAPS figured that we were old enough to take care for ourselves and for @CAPS mom. And @DATE was ending and I wanted to see the movie @CAPS with @CAPS mom and @CAPS so badly.  @CAPS mom had a lot going wrong her doctor put her on several medications to relieve her problems. but @CAPS seemed like @CAPS got a new pill from the doctor every week because the symptoms from each pill was causing more and more problems.  Its mid @DATE, @DATE, and still no sign of @CAPS mom getting any better. @CAPS and I took walks with the dogs to the near by park, we went swimming, watched @CAPS, clean the cars, We would try to find anything to do really.  @DATE came, and @CAPS mom was showing signs of improvement @CAPS was walking more naturally . I called @CAPS dad and asked if he thought going to see a movie was a good idea. he said to wait one more day. I was worried about waiting another day because @CAPS was going home the next day. The next day, I woken up by the soft whisper of @CAPS moms voice. ""@LOCATION, @PERSON honey wake up"" @CAPS shook @CAPS shoulder. I opened @CAPS eyes slowly, opening them wider as @CAPS eyes focused of what was around me. ""@CAPS go to the movies?"" @CAPS shook @CAPS shoulder once again. ""@CAPS, but your sick."" I exhaled a heavy sigh. ""I am feeling a lot better today."" @CAPS smiled. ""@CAPS because the next showing is in twenty minutes."" The sudden rush to @CAPS, woke me up. I then woke @CAPS up and we soon then left. The movie was good. Afterward, @CAPS went home and everything was silent once again, the rooms kept empty, the sun went away, the whole house stood still.  @DATE. this day is usually a time to kick back. I was on @CAPS computer most of the day, @CAPS dad was playing his video game. and @CAPS mom was in the kitchen preparing dinner. @CAPS dad went in to help her with dinner. until @CAPS almost had fallen with a few pans in her hands. @CAPS dad suggested that @CAPS go and take a nap or at least lay down. Later that evening @CAPS dad had found @CAPS mother. laying stiff, cold...@CAPS mother had passed away in her sleep that day. I felt as if @CAPS heart had exploded like a firework. A few days have passed I stood still on the couch. I found comfort in texting @CAPS. Told her what the doctors told us. @CAPS mentioned how torn @CAPS @CAPS was about @CAPS mom. And even though @CAPS was hurting inside, her and her @CAPS @PERSON tried to get @CAPS @CAPS and everyone to laugh. Because they knew that laughter would make some of the pain go away. And I think they are amazing for finding a bit of laughter in a dark place. That is why laughter is a important element of out lives. ",18,17,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0

I believe this because at one point in time my older brother and I did not get along very well. We were almost never around each other, and when we were,we would either be fighting or ignoring one another. It wasn't much of a problem since he is five years older; but once I became older my brother and I began to see one another more often. So we then decided to sit down one day and talk. We weren't exactly sure what to say; so for the first ten minutes we just sat there in silence. Just two guys on the back porch in the middle of the @TIME. Then out of no were he fell over backwards into a bush. We both laughed harder than we have ever laughed in our lives. So @CAPS, when my family get together, there isn't a lot of arguing or fighting and we all sit and tell stories and laugh.For my family and friends, laughter is one of the most important components of a relationship because, with laughter comes happiness, and with happiness comes love; and love is the most important component of life.

He had a @CAPS big hope that he could have a chance at making @PERSON happy. @CAPS... he @CAPS @PERSON if she accepted to be his girlfriend. Without a doubt she said...

But that didn't stop @PERSON from fighting to get @LOCATION's @CAPS. @PERSON is the type of girl that doesn't like hiding anything from her boyfriend. @CAPS one night while @PERSON and @PERSON were talking on the phone, @PERSON decided to ask @PERSON if she was willing to try to forget her ex. @PERSON was scared to answer the question but she had to be honest and said... ""@CAPS @PERSON I'll try but I'm not promising anything.""@CAPS @PERSON and @PERSON have a @CAPS good communication when laughing is involved, @PERSON changed the subject and @CAPS @PERSON if he was willing on doing her a favor.

12320,20802,8,"My relationship with laughter.  Well the first time I came face to face with laughter was when I met my boyfriend for the first time. Before I met him I was depressed all the time and my friends couldn't stand it anymore. But when my friends introduced me to him I fell in love for the first time I was happy for once not depressed and all alone in a corner crying all the time. When that happened for the first time in almost a year I smiled I didn't smile until the day I met him. That's when my friends knew that i found someone to take care of me and love me for who I am.  Later in the relationship is where laughter came into play I was laughing all the time when I was around him and not upset all the time. That's when we started hanging out but, it took all of our friends to us to hang out. After we stated to hang out we got to know each other better then we did for the beginning when we first met. It took until freshmen year for us to start dating. That is when I found out I suppose ably dating someone else and not him I didn't believe it at first until that guy came up to me and started yelling.   He came up to me and comforted me in front of my friends and said ""@CAPS are @CAPS cheating on me and it's over?"" with a guy @CAPS just met. Then he tried telling me it was over and I told him ""We were never dating in the first place!"". My friends walked up to me and saw me in tears and asked me whats wrong and tried to find me someone new. By the time @CAPS did I was with another guy and I'm happy with him and nothing can change that he will always be there for me and no matter what happens between us. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me and he makes me laugh when I'm upset or mad he says ""don't worry everything will be okay I promise so just believe in me.""  Laughter has been in this relationship for almost a year now so we don't plan to change that unless one of us messes up again we have messed up so many time that we don't know what to do anymore. If it leaves now I don't know what I'm going to do it's apart of my life and the relationship now lets see if we can keep it together with out messing up this time around. This part of my relationship is the best and it wont change at least I hope that it wont because it would make me go back to living in fear of my step dad I'm glade that I found someone. I hope that it doesn't change because laughter is what comes with him and when I'm around him he makes me laugh and no one has ever been able to make me laugh when I was crying not even my friends and family. Now that laughter is here almost all the time I can't wait until the day that sorrow goes out the window. So now that me and him are together and happy and hopefully nothing goes bad between us because of how much we love each other and I'm not my bubbly self when he's not around. Six to @CAPS of my friends say "" @CAPS are losing your bubbly self don't let her disappear on @CAPS she is there to guide @CAPS down the road."" @CAPS also told my dad that I don't really hang out with them anymore and the reason @CAPS I don't is because @CAPS can be bossy and @CAPS tell me what I can and can't do. @CAPS can't people just understand that this relationship isn't going to work if @CAPS keep getting in the middle of it @CAPS all think that my life revolves around them and it doesn't. My relationship with laughter has nothing to do with my friends and family it has to do with my boyfriend and me and that's @CAPS I told @CAPS about my relationship with laughter. Lets just say my relationship with laughter will always be here and nothing will change it not even my parents or his parents we can promise @CAPS that much. @CAPS can't this relationship just have a happy ending to it with out anyone or anything trying to get in the middle of it? I just wish that there was a world @CAPS could just run away to with out anyone knowing where it's at in the world. Well just to say nothing can make this relationship ever go bad unless we start to fight again with each other I hope that nothing will tear us apart and if it does who knows what will happen.",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0

There is nothing better than a good funny movie that makes you laugh so hard you cry, your jaw hurts, and your stomach is even sore the next day. Some of my favorite movies are funny.  I bet laughing or making someone else laugh could get you hired at a job. Say you go in for an interview for a job that involves you working with people everyday. Are you going to go in there boring and moditone? No, your going to go in there make the person who is interviewing you laugh and act like you have known him or her since @CAPS @CAPS.  Laughter can also be abused. It can be used in bad ways, such as making fun of people because it @MONTH be funny. Calling kids in your gym class names because they cant throw a baseball as far as you. Laughing @MONTH make people feel as bright as the stars at night, or it @MONTH make people feel as bad as a basketball player missing the buzzer beater to win the championship game. Be careful when you use it, treat it like a loaded gun, because if you use it wrong it could hurt someone.  A few hours after my @CAPS died. My family and I began to talk about all the good memories we spent with her when she was with us. I had noticed that tears were rolling down the sides of my @CAPS @PERSON's cheeks. We then suddenly began to talk about all the times she would get mad mad and swear at my dad when he was a little boy, then get embarrassed because she knew she never should have said the lords name in vain. After thinking back on those moments we began to laugh, and not just a small unnoticeable giggle, i mean we were laughing out loud. It then got rid of that aching sadness that had been in the room all night. I will never forget how laughter that very night would become such an emotional memories later in life.",20,17,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12322,20804,8,"Laughter is important in my life for many reasons. With out laughter my life wouldn't be as wonderful as it is right now. I have many people in my life that make laughter the best way to brighten up my day, like my friends, family, and boyfriend. I have many stories in which laughter was a part of my life, but I'm going to tell you a story about how my boyfriend used laughter to make me feel better and not think about my stomach ache.    It all happened on a @DATE @TIME @CAPS I was heading home from my boyfriends house. We were sitting on the max and my stomach started to hurt. I told my boyfriend about it and he told me that it's probably because I haven't ate anything. I was worried because it was going to be a long trip home. On our trip to my house my boyfriend was trying to distract me so I wouldn't worrying so much about my stomach ache. He started talking to me and telling me how my day was at school and I told him that my day was okay, not bad.     We started talking for awhile, up until my boyfriend took off his hat and said ''from flat to volume!'' @CAPS my boyfriend took off his hat and said that I bursted out laughing! I was laughing so hard that instead of my stomach hurting because I didn't eat all day, it was hurting because of how hard and how much I was laughing. I was laughing so hard because my boyfriends hair was all messed up. His hair looked so funny! As I was trying not to laugh I asked my boyfriend why his hair was like that? He started telling me that @CAPS he was taking a shower he had grabbed a shampoo bottle that said from flat to volume and he didn't know that his hair was going to have so much volume.The whole way home I couldn't stop laughing about my boyfriends hair. I thought it was so funny, that I had forgotten about my stomach ache.     Till this day I still laugh about my boyfriends hair and how it looked that day. We now have an inside joke and every time I remember that day I tell him ''from flat to volume'' and we both just start laughing.Now i know thatlaughter is the best medicine for me @CAPS I have a stomach ache. Laughter will always be a part of me and my life no matter what!",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12323,20805,8," Have you ever wondered how you and your best friends even became friends? Maybe not, but maybe you have and couldn't remember. Well this story I'm about to tell you today is about how my friend @PERSON and I became friends. I'm also going to tell you how we have stayed friends for as long as we have and all the little things that have kept us friends. Admittedly we did not start off as friends who laughed all the time, instead we started off as a crier and a helper.  @PERSON and I first met in the eighth grade. I had just gotten called out of my first period class and greeted by my math teacher @PERSON. @PERSON told me that we had just gotten a new student that moved here from @LOCATION and wasn't exactly happy about it. She also asked me if I wouldn't mind showing her around the school with another classmate, @PERSON, I agreed and walked into the room @PERSON was in. When I saw her the first thing I noticed was her eyes, as the tears went down her face. Then I realized she was a very pretty girl who, like @PERSON said wasn't happy. I will admit i was a little scared to try and show her around seeing as she wasn't happy at all to be here. But once we got started she had calmed down immensely, but she still wouldn't even crack a smile at our feeble tempts to make jokes. I still felt like she should be happy and broke out the big guns. So I walked differently and talked in a funny voice, I even started saying random funny things in long pauses. Eventually she smiled, so I kept going. Toward the end I got her and @PERSON to laugh so hard we all almost wet ourselves. But as funny as it was for us, it definitely wasn't the last funny thing we did. You know the type of funny things that happen and no matter what, you always remember it when you see that person it happened with, right? Well to say the least @PERSON and I have a lot of those moments. Granted a lot of them happen with other people, but that's what makes it fun. Like this one time in our drawing and painting class we, @PERSON, @LOCATION, and @CAPS and I, were all in @PERSON's little office getting a picture to draw. I had been hyper pretty much all day and so had @CAPS else. I randomly look around the room and see a really cute looking poster I hadn't noticed ever before and without realizing it I had said aloud, ""@CAPS, that's really cute."" @CAPS started laughing and holding on to the desk to keep from falling to the ground. I still hadn't realized I said it aloud and was really confused but still laughing because watching them laugh was really entertaining. They finally calmed down long enough to say what I'd just said and I blushed but started laughing along. Now every time they see me and remember that moment they crack up laughing and they point to something and say it the way I said it. That's why I think that having the big memories of the really funny thing has kept us together. It helps us remember the fun times during the bad times. It also helps to keep our link strong throughout the group of our friends.  But the little things matter too. Every little thing we do together as friends helps us later. If we didn't do all the little funny things and only did either big funny things, or boring things, I don't think our friendship would last long. Like when we're talking and we accidentally burp or we fart while we walk. Or maybe when I laugh and I hide my face with my hands and my arms jiggle. Possibly even when we say something weird or walk funny because we really have to go to the bathroom. It's not just being friends that keeps us together it's how we are and who we become with that other person, I feel like I become a better person and I believe I help her become one too. Besides the little things are just as funny as the big things we do.  So as I've stated before laughter is a big part of a friendship. @PERSON and my friendship hadn't started in of laughter, it started in tears and grew to be laughter. Laughter had brought us together in an act of weirdness and it has stayed very strong ever since, not only because we had a lot in common, to be frank we don't really even have that much in common, it is because of the big hilarious moments we've shared not only together, but with other people and the little things we do on a daily basis that we find really funny. I do have to say laughter is probably the best thing to keep any relationship good and healthy.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12324,20806,8," There are a couple things that can lead strangers to being comfortable with each other, in my experience it was laughter. Meeting my boyfriends parents was very nerve wrecking and uncomfortable. I am a people person and I can get along with anybody. Starting a conversation with someone who is judging my every move was a little bit of a challenge.  My boyfriend @PERSON and I have been dating for almost a year now and are the type of people that like spending time with our families. So because of this it was obvious that meeting the family would come into play. I met his parents when we were young and we attended the last years of elementary and some of middle school and all but one year of high school together, I left for a couple years and came back really different. So after @NUM months of dating I met the folks.  One day in @DATE @PERSON had a football game that i attended with some girlfriends who were also dating guys on the team. After a terrible loss @PERSON came out of the locker room and hugged me and told me it was time to meet the parents. I took a deep breath and started to get really nervous. I love meeting new people and I usually don't have a problem with it, but the fact that I wanted his parents to love me put a lot of weight on me.  I slowly walked over after him, and said ""@CAPS"" in my most friendly voice possible. His mother reached out and said "" @CAPS @PERSON, I'm @CAPS"" I took her hand and shook it and replied ""@CAPS, so nice to meet you"". I looked at @ORGANIZATION for reassurance then his father reached out with a very welcoming smile and his eyes looked so familiar and warm. "" @CAPS there, I'm @PERSON"", I shook his hand and felt less nervous and a bit comfortable. "" @CAPS , great to meet you, what did you think of the game?'. He looked surprise that i talked and we started a great conversation about football.  After talking about football for about @NUM or @NUM minutes @PERSON brought up something that reminded me of a joke. I always have lame jokes so I was nervous about telling it to his parents. It wasn't even a funny joke, @PERSON thought it was lame, yet i loved it. I took the chance anyways. I said "" @CAPS that reminds me of a joke"", @PERSON looked at me with wide eyes that said oh god, don't. I looked away and started ""so there were two muffins in the oven one said, wow its hot in here, there the other screamed, holy crap! A talking muffin. I started laughing and my laugh is very odd. Anyone i meet tells me me laugh is so unique. His mother was like ""that is adorable i will have to tell it to @CAPS"", I smiled gratefully. His father @PERSON said so sweetly "" I like your laugh, i ain't heard anything like it"". @PERSON came in and said ""yes her laugh is really something"". We all kinda smiled and at each other and went to dinner, cracking jokes and laughing then laughing at my laugh. Thank goodness for laughing, once we started laughing I felt comfortable and welcomed. Until this day we laugh at me telling that joke. I still until this day am happy i told the joke.",17,18,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12325,20807,8,"   On @DATE, I had a mission trip meeting in @LOCATION, @LOCATION at @NUM o'clock in the @TIME. @CAPS friend @PERSON decided he would go with me. So I had @CAPS grandpa pick us up from the house and take us to @LOCATION. When we got to the church I went to @CAPS meeting till @NUM o'clock, then went to bible study. I was tired and ready to go home by then.    Come to realize @CAPS grandpa is know where to be found, he apperently left to go home and @CAPS mom, grandma and @CAPS sister @CAPS had just got there to pick us up. I had just been informed that there was a parent meeting for the students going on the mission trip. After the meeting we went to @PERSON craft store. When we got there me and @PERSON went over to @CAPS @CAPS, while @CAPS mom, grandma, and @CAPS stayed in @LOCATION. I bought me and @CAPS mom a pair of comfortable slippers. then we went back into @PERSON to brag about the slippers to @CAPS mom and grandma.   That was a bad idea, @CAPS grandma decided she needed a pair for herself, so she walked over to @CAPS @CAPS. She was taking forever. I told her that if she stopped looking at stuff we would go to @CAPS, get a sandwhich, and come back. So we did. When we got to @CAPS @PERSON was in a bad mood because he was ready to go home.   We ordered our sandwhichs and went back to @CAPS @CAPS. She finally found herself a pair of slippers, after looking for an hour and a half. Everyone gets in the car, and we think were going home when all of a sudden grandma shouts out ""were going to @LOCATION's, I want a bowl of chili"". Our reaction was ""@CAPS, @CAPS gosh"". We couldn't let her be hungry, so we had to stop. after getting her chili she says ""I need to go into @ORGANIZATION"", @CAPS boy was that a mistake. We were in @ORGANIZATION forever in a day.   After we got back in the car from @ORGANIZATION I sat in the backseat in the middle of @CAPS and @ORGANIZATION. I told @PERSON not to forget to show @CAPS mom an important piece of mail he had when we got home, and his response was ""@CAPS ya! If we ever get home"". All I could do was laugh. I was being video taped by @PERSON and @CAPS mom kept looking back at me to see if I was ok. I just couldn't stop laughing. I laughed so hard I was crying, I lost all @CAPS breath, and @CAPS face was as red as a cherry. I laughed without a break from @ORGANIZATION to @LOCATION road. When I eventually fell asleep.",18,17,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12326,20808,8," Laughing makes you live longer. That's what I was told as a child. I think laughing is really important in life. And, in relationships. In my realationship with my sister @LOCATION, we laugh all day, everyday. And I think thats why we have most fun together. I laugh most when I'm with my homies. I remember one time I was with @PERSON and we were just laughing so hard over nothing, thats something we do alot. I'm just a laughing person. Everybody knows that. I think when I laugh it just takes everything thats bad right now, and none of that even matters. I have this one friend namd @PERSON, and he was the kind of person that made me laugh no matter what kind of mood I was in. So because of that, he'll always be an important person in my life. One time me and @PERSON were with this girl that was very quiet for some reason when she was with us, and I just straight up told her that she needs to talk, or laugh! or something. Then she opened up and actually laughed about the funny things. See, if your with a bunch of friends, or people that your affiliated with it's not good to just sit there and not say or do anything, just be yourself. Laugh about the things you think are funny even if other people dont kaugh about it. Who cares. Be you. I love, absoulutly love when babies laugh. When a baby laughs, to me it means that baby is gonna be a happy human. In movies and tv shows, sometimes I laugh. I just feel like if you laugh, your life will be way easier than just looking at the negative things. Just be happy, and laugh every once and a while.  One time me and my sister @PERSON stole a truck, well.. We asked the guy if we could use his truck for something and he said yeah, but we really didnt use it for anything.. We just wanted to drive. And, when we started driving, we were going so fast, and blasting loud music. It was hilarious, and now everytime we listen to that song we were blasting, we just crack up laughing. So, when you make good memories and later in life think about the memories, or they get brought up somehow.. It's funny to just sit there and reminise. I could tell you a thousand stories. Heres one. One time, me and @PERSON were living with our good friend @PERSON, and we were under his table pretending we were in a space ship, it was so, so, so, much fun! I'll never forget that time. And even when I'm writing this I still laugh about these stories. One time me and my sister @PERSON were skating downtown, and I was trying to do this one trick, I think it was a tre' flip? Anyways, I tryed to do it and I fell on my butt. It hurt, but it was hilarious. And now everytime we pass that place where i fell, we just laugh about it. Memories are fun, every memory that I have, I laugh when remebered. One time me and @PERSON were hanging out with some cool people, and then we left and went to this girls house, and there we turned the music up all the way and just danced for like a hour, we have a video of it. That was really funny. In the video I'm mostly just laughing. ",15,16,0.0,31,0.0,0.0,0.0,31.0
12327,20809,8,"@CAPS.., that is a sound i love to hear, laughter. Laughter plays a big roll in my life. To me it is the only thing that can keep me going. Sometimes it is even better then ice cream, and that is saying a lot. I have had many different experiences in life that laughter has been a big part of. Like @CAPS my brother got sent back to jail. @CAPS I was @CAPS I had to laugh because it was the only thing that made me feel good inside. Also, @CAPS i got dumped like last nights garbage, laughter made me feel as if nothing had ever happened. So @CAPS people are not feeling the best or are going through struggles in their life, I truly believe that laughter will make everything feel a little bit better. @CAPS!"", it hit me like a brick in the head. Hearing that my brother got put back in jail was a hard thing to hear. He had just gotten out from a four month sentence, three months ago. One of the hardest things is thinking of what to say @CAPS his three year old son, @PERSON, asks ""@CAPS's @CAPS?"". The main reason I'm not as scared for my brother as I was is because of my nephew @PERSON. He can light up any situation with his adorable laugh. So whenever my brother gets thrown back into jail, I know everything will be okay @CAPS I see a big smile on @PERSON's little chubby face. He is my inspiration to smile @CAPS I feel like there is absolutely nothing in this word to smile or laugh about. Even @CAPS we were both sitting in the emergency room he still just kept on laughing.  Being @CAPS is the absolute worst thing in the world to me. I hate not being able to get out of bed and go places. All I usually do is go stuff outside with my friends, but @CAPS I'm @CAPS I cant do anything. The only things I can really do is take nasty medicine. Recently I was in the hospital with very severe abdominal pains. Then not even two weeks later I was back in the emergency room with strep. I was in a lot of pain for about four weeks all together. one thing I hate more then being @CAPS, is people feeling bad for me being @CAPS. So whenever I'm @CAPS I always crack jokes and make people laugh no matter how much it hurts me to laugh. Even though the laughing did not feel good physically, it sure made me feel a lot better emotionally. Laughing is like my brand of medicine for @CAPS I'm not feeling well. It seems to make me feel better faster then any other over the counter medicine. Especially for breaking up with my first ""love"". ""I just don't want my mistakes to hurt you anymore"", that was the last thing he said to me. My first ""love"" just left me standing alone on a staircase to drown in my own tears. It was my first real break-up. I was having a pretty hard time dealing with it. Then the day after we broke up my friends came and picked me up. They told me that I needed to be cheered up. @CAPS we got into town we stopped by the store. My friend @PERSON told me to pick out a half gallon of ice-cream, so I got mint chocolate chip. We finally got to @PERSON's house and he told me that I had to eat the whole half gallon of ice cream to myself. Of course I didn't argue. While I was eating the ice cream him and my friend @PERSON put on a little skit of how they were going to be up my ex boyfriend. I was laughing so hard I got a brain freeze. By the time the skit was over I was rolling on the floor laughing. All the laughing made me forget that I was sad in the first place. I felt that just having a good laugh with my friends brought us closer together. While I was with my ex we never hung out because i was always with him. I had a blast that day and I will remember it forever. Laughing is truly the key to living a great life. ""@CAPS life gives you lemons make lemonade"", that is a quote that I chose to listen to and try to follow. To me the quote is just saying to enjoy the little things in life. So whenever I laugh, I am enjoying a little pleasures in life. Laughing is a part of my life no matter how hard life @MONTH seem. So even if my brother is in jail, I'm @CAPS, or i just got dumped; I laugh so that I don't have to worry anymore. Laughter is a main ingredient to everyone's life, don't forget it or life wont turn out the way that anyone would want it.   """,20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12328,20812,8," Laughter. We all need it. We need it @CAPS a reminder that @CAPS is hope for those who have perseverance, for those who strive not to better others, but for those who strive to better themselves. We need it @CAPS a reminder to live our dreams, instead of dreaming of living. And, in my opinion, most importantly, @CAPS a reminder that even though we @MONTH make mistakes, @CAPS is still a chance for those who simply have the courage to seize it.   In the @DATE, my foster parents decided to go out for dinner. The children, of course, were not invited. We were to either stay home with the babysitter, or go to a friend's house. No one wanted to stay home, @CAPS @CAPS was nothing to do. One of my best friends, @PERSON, was a single child living with her grandmother. I made a quick phone call and ten minutes later I was waiting for her grandmother to pick me up. It was about five in the @TIME, and I was to be back no later then nine. I had four hours, and it was two weeks before @CAPS. Neither of us knew @CAPS to do with so much time on our hands. After all, we only saw each other for a few hours at school. This way new to both of us. We were both sophomores, and I had a crush on @LOCATION. This turned out to be a big problem, considering @CAPS knew this piece of information. @CAPS didn't have a problem with it, but @PERSON, her boyfriend, did. We got along, but he didn't like the fact that I was spending so much time with her, especially while he wasn't @CAPS. He trusted me to take care of her though, so he didn't make a huge deal out of it.   We had decided to set up the @CAPS tree first, and go from @CAPS. We both had @CAPS, so just about everything on the tree was shiny. Tinsels, ornaments, pictures, @CAPS name it. It took about twenty minutes to get everything set up, not including the time it took to unpack all the decorations. It looked magnificent when we were done. I'd help make some pretty @CAPS looking trees, but this was by far the best. I was proud of our work. I didn't have much in my life to appreciate, so this was one of those things that normally wouldn't matter, but suddenly became really important. We admired our work for a few minutes and then went down to the den. @PERSON got on the @CAPS to talk to @PERSON for a bit, while texted my girlfriend. I was in the process of preparing myself to break up with her.   @PERSON and I had been together for most of my sophomore year, and I was beginning to regret it. Our relationship had started when one of my buddies, @PERSON, and hers ended. I know this sounds bad, but I really didn't want to be with her at first. I was putting myself between @PERSON and her so that they would stop fighting so much. Now I was starting to see why he broke up with her in the first place. @CAPS was like a bad drug that got @CAPS really high, and then dropped @CAPS like a rock. @CAPS was extremely controlling. @CAPS wasn't @CAPS for me, and @PERSON had finally convinced me that enough was enough. After I broke up with @PERSON, I felt both happy, and depressed. I was happy that I could be free, but I was depressed because I felt so alone. I'd never been @CAPS at getting close to people, so this was hard for me to do.   Seeing me so roughed up didn't sit well with @PERSON. @CAPS knew me much better then most people, so @CAPS knew that I needed help quick. @CAPS did something so subtle, that to most it would have seemed unimportant. @CAPS took one look at me, got up from the computer, and gave me a long hug. At first I didn't think it was a @CAPS idea. Her boyfriend was very protective of @PERSON. He didn't like guys getting close to her, under any circumstances.   ""@CAPS @CAPS please just try to relax for a minute? Your making me nervous."" @CAPS said in that tone that meant it was more of an order then a question. Maybe it was the fact that I was in such a bad mood that this seemed like the funniest thing in the world to me. I started laughing really hard.   ""@CAPS. That wasn't so hard, was it?"" @CAPS @CAPS pulled away from the embrace, I kissed forehead; our way of saying ""your beautiful.""   ""@CAPS @CAPS going to be okay?"" @CAPS asked in a worried voice.   ""@CAPS, I'll be fine. Thanks @PERSON.""   ""@CAPS. @CAPS never showed me that guitar thing.""   ""@CAPS guitar thing?""   ""@CAPS said @CAPS played guitar."" @CAPS then I realized that I might not ever get another friend @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS this one.   ""@CAPS @CAPS. Come on. I'll show @CAPS how to play @CAPS man.""",20,19,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12329,20813,8," As people have bonded over the years, those bonds have been streanthend by laughter, joy, and trust. All of these are imporntant but they all work together to build these bonds. For normal people to enjoy one another they must have fun and fun begins with laughter. Laughter comes from the brain and if two people think in the same thing as being funny, it brings them together with their similar intrests.  By telling a funny joke or being a person who always ends up with a smile on his or her face, brings people around more easily. Since I was young I've always been a real happy kid and one who is easy to be around. I believe I am like this because my parents have always told me, ""People that are happy are the ones people want to be."" @CAPS by being a seemingly happy person it has given me the friends I have. Although I have never really understood what it ment because it could mean many differant things.  When ever I'm with my friends, looking back on it now, we are always laughing or joking about something. We could be laughing about ourselfs, or we could be laughing at a random person on the street. We could be doing absloutley nothing and be laughing at something stupid, but still be having good times. It @MONTH be starting an argument that is funny to us. If someone starts saying stupid stuff, then one of us will jump on the chance to make him sound as stupid as possiable. Most of the time we wont get butt hurt about it, but alot of the time we will take it to far. With all the laughter we have shared before it keeps us friends. Stupidity and pain are probly the top two reasons why we laugh. Stupidity would be if some one says something that doesn't make sence or came in at the wrong time. I have never under stood why we laugh at pain, maybe it is because we are glad that it is not us in pain,although sometimes it is, but maybe it is because we know that they will get over it. When someone is hurt badly, and another person is laughing about it alot of the time I will see them get angry because they are being made fun of for their pain. They need to just realize that it is funny for people to get hurt and know that they laugh at it too. Laughter will always bring people to relationships. It show common intreasts and what people can tolerate from others. Laughter is the main component to bringing happiness into peoples life, with out happieness and laughter this world would be supper boring.",18,18,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12330,20814,8," Laughter is a mystery. Happens @CAPS ever it pleases. It puts smiles on faces. Laughter just happens in many ways it can. Although, mine just happened to end up in a crazy situation with a huge mess to follow it. Things got extream, unforgettable. Things you could never forget.  Around two months ago, in the cold @DATE. It was my @NUM birthday. I threw a little party for myself at my house. Though, I was in for a little treat. @CAPS everyone arrived they all had a smirk on their faces. Nobody would tell me whats going on. I started to become distraught about it all. Until my buddie @PERSON and my boyfriend @PERSON walked into the kitchen with a @NUM pound bucket full of spaghetti, with a ten pound gallon can of tomato sauce. Next thing I knew my mouth was agape. I couldn't believe my eyes, not understanding why so much of it. Also, why did they have it. My mother walked out and exclaimed ""@CAPS up the cars, and let's go!"" @CAPS we approached the @ORGANIZATION, I had a funny feeling in the pit of my gut. I looked around and noticed my sister in law was holding a video camera. Right then and there I knew something was going to happen. Something big, extraordinary, out of the extream and I was right. Spaghetti was flying everywhere, getting in peoples hair, faces. Clothes were getting stained and messy. Not to mention it was cold,wet and rainy outside. The fog made it hard to see who u were hitting and who was throwing it at you. By the end of the noodle war, I looked the worse. Even now the shoes i was wearing are stained. @CAPS we got back to my house we had to wash down with the hose. I swore i was going to get sick from the cold water running down my face. I could feel noodles falling outta my hair and clothing, the sauce steaming down my face. Laughing here and laughing there. Everyone was laughing at others for how badly they were covered with noodles and sauce. Eventually, we all got hungry. We decided on nachos. So, my mom poured two family size nacho chips on the table followed by two ten gallon cans of nacho cheese with jalapenos, olvis. You @MONTH think the noodle and sauce was messy, well that's where I went wrong. My friend @CAPS dropped nachos on my couch. @PERSON threw nacho cheese at @LOCATION, she threw chips at @ORGANIZATION. @PERSON tossed cheese at me and ended up on my dog. Let's just say my living room was a cheese fest. I couldn't believe that nacho cheese got stuck in my dogs fer and in all the girls hair. Chip crumbs were in the couch and cheese was on the floor and @CAPS tree. So @PERSON finally said""@CAPS more nachos!""  @CAPS on it was cake time. Ginger thought that there wasn't going to be another mess. Well once again she was wrong. They all started singing the happy birthday song, cameras were flashing, my mother in the background crying. She cries on our birthdays because she says its just a year closer to her kids moving out. I figured she would be use to it knowing that she already had two kids move out. All of a sudden there was frosting on my face! I rubbed the frosting off and smeared it on @PERSON face. Though he just rubbed it back onto mine. My mom grabbed a plate and threw it at @LOCATION, she tossed it at @CAPS then @ORGANIZATION and @PERSON then @PERSON. Chocolate frosting was everywhere along with nacho cheese. Soon after that we played video games. Of course me being me I played @CAPS @CAPS @NUM live on @CAPS @CAPS. I got irritated with someone on the game and ended up throwing the controller at my television and broke it. Mother wasn't to pleased with me after that. Oh well, we still got to watch movies in the other room. Eventually people started leaving. Saying our goodbyes, ill see you @CAPS, peace out dude. We said it all. I looked back in the living room and say nothing but huge mess of chips, nacho cheese, and cake. Not to mention my broken t.v. I got stuck cleaning the mess for over three hours. Though, we were laughing the entire time it happened. Having the greatest time ever with each other. If I could I would go back and do it all over again just for the fun and laughs. Laughter is everywhere. You @MONTH not see it right away. Though you will @CAPS you started laughing your brains out. Laughing puts everyone in good moods and smiles on there faces.

But many other people believe and (think) that laughter is an important part of any relationship with your friends, family ect. Now I'm going to talk about a few reasons of how laughter can be a benefit to us, and how it can also make us have distances from people, or how laughter works in between relashionships we have with friends. Many people think that it's really fun to laugh about simple things and thats me I can laugh for things that might not seem funning to others, but to me they might seem extremely funny. I won't stop laughing for a while. But many other poeple don't consider laughter as funny, as many others. I believe that laughter is an important part of us because it shows people around you the way you are and how you express your self on things. Many of your friends or even your family will know what type of person you are and how silly you can get to be sometimes. Thats the reason why I think it's a great idea or (thing) to do around, just have some fun and laugh. Now talking about relashionship in between people. Do you think that laughter can be an important part of any relationship or how could it help us (ways)????? Well yes I do think that laughter can be extremely important in many relationship we have with people. You get to know and others get to know about you and how you are.  Eventhough many relationships that we have with our friends, family, or with new people we meet. I believe that laughter tells you how a person is and how that person reacts to what other people do or tell them. Laughter expresses how that person is and wheither they are fun people to be around. Laughter even tells you if that person has a lot of humor, just a little, or doesn't have any humor at all. When people don't have that much humor they really don't understand and get the funny parts from jokes or anything. I also think that laughter is really important to any type of relationship you have with anybody, because that makes you know that person a lot better. But other people consider laughter being a reason that distances two people from each other.I don't considerlaughter being a reason for to people to have distances in between. The reasons why I think and say this is becasue their are many people that laugh a lot almost crying and they don't have distances in between other people or anything. They might get more friends or more people to talk to them becasue other people as well might see how that person is and they might see that the person is really fun to be around with. I know this becasue I laugh a lot and that hasn't happened to me. Thats why I don't consider and don't believe that laughter is being the reason to have distances in between people (relationship). In my opinion I consider laughter a very important part of who we are, the way we think, and also the things we like to do. What I mean by this is that you can have some humor but you don't actually express the way you are thinking about what other do. Or if something is super silly and theirs a new kid at school and you or someone else says something you might probably think that it's funny but you might just not want to laugh at that moment becasue you @MONTH a little to shy or simply becasuue you might not know that person as well and maybe the other person won't have enough confidence to laugh with you for whatever silly thing someone just said. Although many people still should laugh whenever they want. Sometimes if you laugh a lot you might be the happiest and funniest person anywhere. Or whenever somebody is sad you might as well be the only person theri who can make her/him laugh and happy. In addition these were some of the reasons why i think that laughter is great for you, that way people will get to know you better. These were a few reasons of how laughter can be a benefit,how it can distance people.",15,16,0.0,31,0.0,0.0,0.0,31.0

Like this one time me and my friends where walking to the store, I start pointing out the most random things. When I pointed out the @CAPS store, he started laughing so hard that he literally peed his pants. So we had to go back to his house so he could change into some clean cloth, and it took him @NUM to @NUM minutes to get dressed. So I asked @CAPS he was doing in there, and he said. ""I'm taking a pee."" @CAPS I started laughing and rolling on the floor, and that's when it hit me why he was laughing so hard about me pointing out the @CAPS store. It was because the last time we had gone inside and there was a man talking about his son's football team which my friend and I was on at the time, was in the top ten. Guss @CAPS we really weren't. The man felt so afraid of @CAPS the lady he was talking to might think of him. So @CAPS gets up and says to us. ""@CAPS you for letting me know that. I thought he was right for a second."" @CAPS gives us a hug and the man gets up and says. ""@CAPS about me? How come I don't get a hug."" That when I started to laugh harder @CAPS heck.

Laughter is the key to solving life's problems.@CAPS is a way of adding something special into our life and comes from many different areas of life .Laughter could come from a pitiful joke that someone could have told you,@CAPS could be brought up by a show, and @CAPS could also come from the joy we get when a near loved one has returning home from a long journey. Imagine seeing something comical like a person falling down or crashing into a pole , the moment right when that happens you hear your self laughing as hard as you can that you practically cant breath and the person standing right next to you is joining in on the laugh. Although @CAPS might seem rude and disrespectful you have just made a bond with the person right next to you and found a similarity between the both of you. @CAPS is how friendships are brought up and made, just by one little thing that made you both laugh and have a connection with each other can trigger a brand new friendship between to people that could either last a minute or can last a life time. In my case @CAPS is how I met one of my closest friend ever , we had seen a student from our class trying to show the class how cool he was by climbing up the flag pole and replace the @ORGANIZATION state flag with his own personal home made flag ( he got the @CAPS off of a show ) ,as he was heading up the pole almost half way their he must have gotten scared because minutes later he started yelling for help, a minute later the faculty members finally heard his cry's and yells and tried to get him down from ware he was, @CAPS took them almost half an hour to get him down. @CAPS was the moment ware I had made one of the greatest friendship I've ever had in my life. Many friendships are made in class and with the people you go to work with but a great friendship is brought up by a simple laugh two people share with each other. God laugh's last. @CAPS is the name of @PERSON son of @CAPS and @PERSON. In @CAPS story @PERSON the @CAPS of @PERSON claimed that she was surprised when she was blessed with her only child and that people would laugh and be surprised the same way she was when they hear the news. Being surprised or shocked can also bring some one to laugh at what either happened in their surroundings or what they did them self's. I remembered a time ware I laughed at something that took me by surprise, @CAPS was when my @CAPS lost the keys to the house inside the car, we looked for them every ware but had no luck finding them, after an hour had pass we called my dad so he would bring the other key to the house, after we called him we had to wait half an hour for my dad to get their but as soon as my father parked in the driveway my @CAPS found the key that she lost inside her pocket (@CAPS was a typical cartoon moment).When we heard the news we all just started laughing at what has just happen, we were all shocked and a little dumbfounded when that happened. As you can see being surprise can also bring a smile and a laugh onto someones face. Picture yourself staring into the eyes of some one close to you with a blank face and trying not to let out the slightest bit of a giggle or a smile and then find yourself laughing nonstop for no reason. That is basically an every day thing for me and my sister. My sister and I can't stare at each other for even a minute, we eventually start laughing the first five seconds and end up laughing a hole hour without stop, but as soon as we stop laughing we note's that we were laughing for no apparent reason , which would make us laugh for another hour more.That the kind of laughter that two people that are so close to each other get , the kind that you don't need a reason to laugh but you end up laughing for no reason at all.@CAPS shows the connection two people have with each other the type ware you know what the other person is thinking. Laughter can come from old memory's of family gatherings for the holidays , friendships we made when we were in school , memory's of our childhood and how thing we thought then were in style and cool are k now thing we look back into and laugh at, by being a little surprise, and can also be The fact that we know someone by heart .",16,16,0.0,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.0
12334,20819,8," LaughterI laugh everyday. I feel a lot of different emotions when I am laughing. Some of the emotions are happiness, sadness, and pain. I use laughter to let my emotions be seen. when I laugh I usually feel happy after wards en less I am crying because I am hurt. When I am sad I tend to laugh and smile a lot to hide the pain I am feeling because I don't want people to see me sad all the time and think I am playing the sad card to get attention. But laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better. When I am sad i tend to rely on laughter to get me threw my day because if i didn't have laughter i would have people asking what was wrong all day and it would drive me crazy. When I am angry the only way I can laugh is if a friends or family member is trying to make me happy or if I am reminiscing of fun times iv had. It makes me happy when I laugh and brightens my day when I am anger. I also laugh at things people say to me even tho they hurt my feelings when they said it, because I don't want them to know they hurt me. When I am happy all I do is smile and laugh. Laughter brightens my life when its a happy laugh.My friends and I can just sit there and laugh for hours and nothing. My friends and I can be pretty silly at times and all we can do is laugh, have fun and be in a good mood, and that makes me pretty happy. Some things in my life that make me laugh are my nephew my family and friends. All those things I was just talking about come into my mind when I think of laughter.

It @MONTH be at an elegant restaurant sitting at a petite table in the distant corner. For me, it lingered in an old fifth grade classroom. I stumbled through the doorway carrying @CAPS purple backpack and @CAPS lunch pale resting in @CAPS left hand. I recognized everyone from @CAPS previous years of elementary school, and shortly joined them after visiting @CAPS hook outside the door. I had been waiting anxiously for @CAPS turn at the fifth grade. The legendary @PERSON, was known as the ""coolest"" teacher around. He played a large role in the gossip of the young students, and each of us had our hopes set high. ""@CAPS your seats @NUM graders!"" announced @PERSON @CAPS with a contagious smile. Kids scattered around to room searching for seats near their closest friends. Everyone listened attentively to @PERSON's introduction to the year. His voice caught our full attention, but not too exciting compared to our expectations. He appeared very nice as most teachers come, but still nothing spectacular. The day dragged on. The sleepy faces returned and the vivid colors had escaped our touch. The day finally reached an end, not satisfying the eager children. The next day rose quickly and I trudged back to the disappointing classroom. To @CAPS surprise, the next day was nothing like the first. The classroom @CAPS experienced a drastic change. Every wall was filled with endless color. Posters layered over the plain paint with fascinating pictures and words. A fancy popcorn machine rested in the back of the room. Fresh popcorn overflowed from inside. The smell traveled through our needy nostrils as we entered. Mr. @CAPS sat contently at his broad desk as we made our way to our seats once again. He welcomed us to our second day. After the first couple minutes of class I had found that the rumors were true. He had a sense of simple humor that created giggles in every corner of the class. His ideas and word choice related to us as @NUM graders. We found his subtle jokes quite amusing to our young minds. He spoke like we spoke, he acted like we acted, and he joked like we joked. He even created customized nicknames for each of us. Laughter hung over our heads like a heavy @CAPS, never continuing along. Weekly popcorn servers would hand out stuffed bags to all the kids as the class read aloud. Kids became ecstatic on jeopardy @CAPS gathering teams as quick as possible. His classroom became a place that we wanted to stay forever, never parting from hour long games and water chugging contests. Despite the everlasting fun and games, @PERSON showed us what it was really like to be a learner. He cared about our future and pushed us to strive in every moment of life. He taught us to write with desire and worth. To express our feelings on paper and tell the world a story that we want heard. He would plan one on one time with students struggling in a particular subject, and next class their confidence had bloomed. He had an ability to reach into our minds, find out who we were, and emerge that hidden confidence to become @CAPS. We respected him, yet felt comfortable messing around with him during class as he had frequently done to us. @PERSON gave us a craving to learn.  @DATE @TIME, I had began to walk home, when @PERSON @CAPS stopped me at the door.  ""@CAPS @PERSONC!"" I unexpectedly said in a high tone, not hiding @CAPS enthusiasm. He chuckled, ""@CAPS fun at class today?"" ""@CAPS yeah,"" I answered with a grin. ""I'm glad"" he continued, then changing the subject, ""I was thinking about having a huge dodge ball tournament at recess tomorrow. Do @CAPS think that would be a good idea?"" I snickered to myself, trying to comprehend the fact that an adult had said this to me, ""That would be so fun."" ""@CAPS,"" he expressed quite excited, ""@CAPS are a really neat kid, @CAPS know that? Its a lot of fun having @CAPS in class."" @CAPS face lit up. I stood there smiling for quite some time. We finished our slight conversation and I continued home. Every student in the class yearned to be liked by @PERSON, as if he were the most popular kid at school. I was liked by @PERSON I was liked by the man that changed @CAPS whole outlook on education and life. Gradually, from time to time, I drift back to the careless days of @NUM grade and @PERSON I still laugh at the ridiculous events that occurred in that small classroom each and every day. Frequently, I glance above me to witness that dense @CAPS that still hovers above me. Laughter has left a mark on me, and those kids of @CAPS @NUM grade class. ",30,25,0.0,55,0.0,0.0,0.0,55.0
12336,20822,8," Laughing is one of the key components in all my relationships with others. It lightens the mood of any situation and can really lift my sprits when I'm having a bad day. It is often the ice breaker when I meet someone new and can help me get closer to the friends I already have.  On the first day of school, freshman year, I met a girl named @LOCATION. We were in writing class and there was a boy named @CAPS sitting between us. @CAPS and I were talking about our schedules, and he said something that made our conversation slightly uncomforatable. I looked up and saw that @LOCATION had heard what he had said and had a look on her face that was somewhere between being embarrassed for me and close to laughing. I smiled at her and mouthed the word ""awkward"" when @CAPS turned away. This was her cue that it was okay to laugh, and she did so subtly. I didn't know that this first laugh would lead to many more in a friendship that would develop almost instantly. After the first week of schedules being changed and students being shuffled around, we found out that we had every single one of our classes together, except @CAPS. We probably spent more time laughing in those classes than getting work done, and I'm not exactly sure how we managed to pass all our classes. Spending so much time together, it was only a matter of time before we had enough inside jokes to fill up a dictionary. Nearly any word or just the sight of something related to one of our jokes can send us into a fit of laughter. Sometimes, we don't have to say anything at all. I'll just look at her, and we'll burst out laughing. Because of this, our friends often question our sanity. When we start laughing, they'll look at eachother, and then at us for a clue as to why, or ask if we are okay. They don't understand us the way we understand eachother. People always get our names mixed up even though we look nothing alike. Our names dont even rhyme, or start with the same letter. But I can't really blame them. We're so much alike! From the activities we participate in to the way we think, we could almost be the same person. She makes me laugh every single day, and she's one of my best friends. @CAPS is another one of my friends who is constantly making me crack up. Whenever I'm with her, I'm always terrified of peeing in my pants. She's not as close to me as @LOCATION is, but we've gotten to be such better friends this year. We have a lot of classes together this year, and that's probably why we've gotten closer. We're always doing stupid stuff together, and laughing about it the whole time. For example, she and I like to laugh obnoxiously loud and exaggerate our ""ha's"" when someone tells a really lame or cheesy joke. Our biotech teacher loves to tell cheesy jokes, so when we're in his class, we sit together anticipating one of his jokes so that we can laugh. We also like to chew our gum with our mouths open, in order to make the chewing noise louder. I often laugh so hard that I can't even chew. I know I'll have a good day if I'm with @CAPS. She can make me laugh in a way a lot of my other friends can't. It comes deep from within, to the point where you can't even breathe, and tears and running down your face. It makes your entire face is sore, even your eyes, from being scrunched up for so long. She's such a fun person to be around, and I'm glad to have her as one of my friends. Laughing is a very important part in the relationships I have with other people. If my friends couldn't make me laugh, our friendship would be so much more boring. Nothing would be fun. If I never laughed, I'd never be happy, and that's not a life I'm willing to try. Life is hard. It's not easy, and it's not always going to be smiles and smooth sailing. There's going to be sadness and rough waters. But no matter how tough this life @MONTH get, I know I'll have friends like @LOCATION and @CAPS there to share a laugh.",25,20,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12337,20823,8," Laughter is like cooking; it brings people of every kind together, but the wrong food or the wrong time can bring discomfort to you and others around you, such as beans. Laughter is a medicine. Laughter is a universal language; you can speak @CAPS ""language"" with a foreign friend, even when you know not an ounce of their native tongue. Laughter differs, ranging in loudness, pattern, softness, and attitude. You laughed weeks into @CAPS world and you'll be laughing your way out of it as well. Sometimes in life, it is important to laugh! Laughter is forgiving and a nod to acceptance. It was my freshman year and I had arrived early that morning to keep my friend company who's mom had dropped her off at such an early time, due to transportation conflicts. I wasn't sure why we were even fighting or why we were on @CAPS particular subject; I only knew we had gone off on a ""bunny trail"" and @CAPS was picking me apart for something I had done weeks ago. Our voices were escalating and despite the fact our disagreement wasn't taking a turn toward the physical, our words were just as devastating, taking jabs below the belt and giving ""black eyes"" of sorts to both teams. @CAPS was right and I knew it, but did @CAPS really have to carry such an air of self-righteousness? I thought, ""@CAPS @CAPS hadn't done what @CAPS did, I wouldn't have any secrets to spill."" @CAPS was also wrong of me, but my attention wasn't focusing on that, but rather on deflecting her fiery words, sure to not let my guard down and start crying or something ridiculous like that.  ""That only happenedone time!""@CAPS declared as @CAPS tried to defended herself. ""@CAPS way, you didn't have to tell the whole world!"" ""I didn't tell the world,"" I objected. ""I only told one person...who told one person, who told another person...and so on.""@CAPS raised her eyebrow in a manner as @CAPS to say, ""@CAPS? You @CAPS know what I'm talking about."" The air in the room was as stiff as our direction we were taking in our argument, going no where and getting to no point. The feeling was mutual; @CAPS was done with me, I was done with her. @CAPS leaned back casually against the wall, attempting to appear apathetic, when her ankle succumbed to gravity and the present moisture, grazing the surface and causing her to loose her footing. All the cool @CAPS once had was thrown out the window. Her shoe caught the slick surface of the tile, wet from where hundreds of trodden footsteps were left from that morning's downpour. Crashing down, @CAPS met the unforgiving, stone floor with a @CAPS! which left her face dazed and pride altered. I wish that was how the conversation had gone--with her standing not three feet tall and me towering above her. Concealing the slight satisfaction that was lurking behind my dimples, I slowly slid down the wall that stood behind me, coming to eye level with her. I took one look into her eyes, as @CAPS they were waving a white flag and then the smug victory left me. I craned my neck backward, smiled at the ceiling and let out a giggle. I'm not sure what @CAPS thought about that at first yet slowly but surely, @CAPS managed a chuckle. My giggle triggered into a full-out laughter seizure, her catching on and soon leaving us both laying on the floor. There was nothing particularly special about that bleak, speckled tile, but it was that desolate stone we ended up sprawled on, heads huddled on and hands on our bellies, trying to steady our breaths back into normalcy that one early morning. Sure, I apologized and @CAPS accepted, but I think her forgiveness went without saying; laughter is not dependent on words. ""@CAPS,"" @CAPS managed with a smile. The laughter my friend and I had shared in that pre-school classroom carried throughout the day.  ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" That very distance brought assurance into the relationship I shared with my friend. No, it didn't solve our problems, but it reminded us of how silly and meaningless our petty arguments amounted to be, definitely something worth laughing at. Sure, her fall from grace triggered the expression of innocent surrender from my part, laughter, but it was the letting go of bitterness and the welcoming of a laugh from both sides that ended it all. So, no, while we were not on the same brave wave, our laughter was above picking sides--we were still speaking the same ""language.""",21,20,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0

When you're feeling sad, angry, or in an argument, laughing can turn any negative feelings into good ones. Though you @MONTH not want to show the turn of emotion, it is very hard not to. Laughter is an important thing to have in abundance throughout your relationships. Laughing is a wonderful feeling. Whether it be a chuckle or a hilarious outburst, it completely changes one's mood.

Sharing a @CAPS is a great way to start friendships and keep them thriving. Relationships without laughter soon end. It is almost impossible to be good friends with someone without being able to @CAPS together. Laughter is something that needs to be exposed in relationships often. Without it, there is no connection, joy, or excitement. There is no common ground if you're unable to @CAPS with someone. People need relationships with humor. Laughter bonds people together at any age. When I was still in diapers, I watched a video titled ""I @CAPS to @CAPS."" I would watch this countless times during the day with my parents and siblings. Now, whenever that video is brought up we have a great time reminiscing about those days. Being able to @CAPS together has brought my family relationships to the highest point. Relationships are very important to have; including laughter will only make them stronger. Not only is laughter important, but it is contagious.  Laughter can lighten a tough situation and lift everyone's spirits. It is very hard not to @CAPS when someone else is laughing. Everyone has their own @CAPS too. Sometimes, it is someone's @CAPS that provokes laughter within the group. Making others @CAPS is a wonderful feeling as well. Comedians make a career out of making people @CAPS. There are good feelings that emerge when you can make someone @CAPS. @PERSON is one of my personal favorite comedians. I @CAPS his style and the way he sets up his jokes. He knows how to make people @CAPS. All of one's friendships need someone who can lift the spirits higher. However, the laughter shouldn't come from making fun of someone. It should come from the situation or a circumstance that the group @MONTH be facing. That is key to having a good comedian in your circle of friends. The healing powers of laughter are real and they work. There have been studies of how laughter can heal the body. Such things as laughter therapy is a very real treatment for troubled individuals. Norman @CAPS' book, ""Laughter is the best medicine"" explains the powers of laughter in detail. @CAPS watched The @CAPS @CAPS and laughed himself to wellness.

I love her more then anyone else in the world. One thing that does make us closer is that we laugh at each others mistakes. When one of us messes up the other will laugh at them and then try to help with the problem. When one of us does mess up with something we are always the first to now about what it was with or who it was with even if we do not like the other person that they are having the problems with. Conflict, I think is something else that i think is very important in a good relationship. Me and her fight all the time with each other. Even if its for the littlest and stupidest thing's. We always find one way to fight over something. If it's for the other messing up where it could or would completely mess with mine or her life. We protect each other from messing up are lives to much. We stop each other from doing really stupid things. We have strange feeling when the other is hurt or might be hurt by someone or something. Trust is something that is very important for a relationship. Trust, you can be there or tell the someone anything no matter what it is. Me and her now everything there is to now about each other. If you want to now something about me you could go to her and she could tell you. If you wanted to now something about her you could go to me and i could tell you. I could tell her anything even if she is going to be mad at me for a while if I ever really needed her to be there for me I now she would be as soon as possible. We will almost never judge the other for something they did or are going to do. We now what the other person has done and what they have not done as well. I would trust her with my life if I had to.

You begged for this remember? For months and months, it was all you wanted, all you thought about, all you dreamt about. So I went with the girls. As expected, @CAPS walked down the three-person wide staircase side-by-side, and I shuffled awkwardly behind them. Finally arriving at @NUMscalier, we sat at a table, the three girls talking. I glazed my eyes over, attempting to look lost in thought, as if I didn't care I wasn't included. Selfish thoughts buzzed in my head; if @CAPS weren't talking to me, why should I make the effort to talk to them?   I really had no idea how @CAPS felt about me. How does someone feel about their shadow? @CAPS notice it, sure, but it never offers up insight, it never makes you laugh. It's all in the confidence, said my mother's voice, all how you carry yourself. But I knew it wasn't that simple. I was just too alien. These girls would never understand me, as I would never understand them. In frustration, I started to flick peas across the room with my spoon. Pat, flick, sproing.  This caught the interest of @PERSON, as @NUMle and @ORGANIZATION were discussing something very emotional. Tears began to pour out of @ORGANIZATION's eyes. Sniffling, she and @NUMle went to the bathroom, leaving me all alone with @PERSON. Only @PERSON could have felt my felt my same emotion as he stared up at @CAPS. Silently, I continued shooting peas. @PERSON just stared at them as @CAPS darted around the room. Suddenly, with a horrible miscalculation, a pea hit a boy in the face. And then, he turned around and swore. And then, @PERSON and I looked at each other from across the table.  And then, we laughed.  We laughed so hard I cried. So hard that huge, alien tears flooded from my eyes. People around us were laughing too, even though @CAPS had no idea what was so funny. I didn't even know what was so funny. But it didn't matter, because we were dripping tears and snot, reaching for each other, reenacting the pea hitting the boy's face. It was as if we had been friends for years, and laughing happened all the time. It was saturated with all the angst and lonliness and despair I had felt the past four weeks. The connection we felt was instantaneous, like lightening, the kind of connection I felt with my best friends back home. I felt that huge swelling sensation in my chest, like a balloon was stuck inside. My stomach was aching and my cheeks were so sore I felt them seizing up. My heart felt whole even for that second. My soul was open. It was the best laugh of my life.  Sniffle sniffle. GASP. Laughter. GASP. Swipe of tears. Sniffle sniffle. Laughter. GASP. This is why. I thought. This is why you came.

Do you want to know @CAPS it is?"" I nodded half thinking there was a magical medication or spell. ""@CAPS."" @CAPS said. ""@CAPS?!"" I was utterly shocked. ""@CAPS, it's simply,"" @CAPS said gently, knowing my easy temper, ""@CAPS through the stages of grieving. Feel lost for a little bit, @CAPS then find your way back home. @CAPS is in your heart @CAPS always will be. Find a wave of joy @CAPS @CAPS with the flow. Love life, because, as you have just seen, it can be so short.""

That's when I discovered a small piece of paper the size of a deck of cards. I flipped it over, showing that it was a picture. A tear leaked out of the corner of eye. It was of me @CAPS @PERSON. We were both in a mud pit. My blond hair looked like dirt ( considering that I had been rolling in mud). My pit bull was rubbing @CAPS greasy head on my shoulder smearing more mud on to myself. I smiled, missing him even more, @CAPS feeling a lot better then a minute before. I loved him. I loved him so much. I still do this day, @CAPS I had to get over that my friend was gone. After I saw the picture, I had laughed to myself, automatically feeling better about being such a horrid granddaughter @CAPS a inconsiderate best friend. @CAPS seeing the good times we had, @CAPS smiling, made me honestly feel better about myself.

Exhausted from the fourteen hour flight, I barely knew what time it was. The only things keeping me awake were the jolting of the bus and @NUM other @CAPS I barely knew gossiping quietly. We were going to visit and live with a group high school students, affectionately referred to as ""our @CAPS."" I had met @CAPS partner, @LOCATION, only once. Everything I knew about her, her life, her family I learned from maybe ten, maybe @NUM short @CAPS messages. Communication was going to be problematic. @CAPS mother started teaching me @CAPS when I turned two, but I was nowhere near fluent; I was self-conscience and uncomfortable around native speakers. @PERSON's @CAPS was decent, but her family spoke only @CAPS. Finally, the bus drove down the narrow cobbled streets of @CAPS. It pulled up to a plaza packed with people. The doors hissed open, and we filed out into the crowd, standing on tiptoes to search for our new families. All around me, people chattered in a mix of @CAPS and @CAPS. @PERSON and her parents waited somewhere in the middle, and I slowly wove @CAPS way towards them. Brigitte, @CAPS host mother, grabbed me in a hug. ""@CAPS gehts? @CAPS war dein @PERSON? How @CAPS you? How was your flight?""  @CAPS of @CAPS @CAPS, I faltered, ""@CAPS @PERSON war sehr langalso ich bin ein bisschen muede.

She explained, ""@CAPS is very excited to meet you. @CAPS is so small; we never get tourists. We only get @CAPS exchange students every other year."" @CAPS stomach was filled with that jittery-sick feeling of nervous anticipation. Normally, making friends was easy for me, but this time was different. I only minimally understood the language and culture of the people surrounding me. The long flight was evident in the sleepless bags under @CAPS eyes and @CAPS greasy, knotted hair. @CAPS jet-lagged brain wondered how I would get along with these people. Would I fit in, be able to slip into @CAPS life without many hitches or snags? We passed from the antiquated street to a dusky tunnel-like entryway. After a few turns, we emerged into an open courtyard. An array of food covered several tables, and the scent of grilling bratwurst wafted through the air. ""@CAPS you hungry? You should have something to eat. We have so much food here,"" @PERSON told me. I grabbed a plate and placed a roll, strawberries, and a sausage on it; I was too anxious to really be hungry. @PERSON steered me towards a worn table with wooden benches, where her friends were already enjoying dinner and a few beers. She introduced me, and I perched stiffly on the edge of the seat. @CAPS talked excitedly, questioning me about @CAPS life. As @CAPS loosened up, they began to joke, sometimes in @CAPS, sometimes in @CAPS. Some of the @CAPS teased me about @CAPS accent. It wasn't a mean teasing; they weren't trying to be malicious, just light and funny. So I laughed. In that moment, I seemed to fit better with these people I only sometimes understood.

Even though we don't have everything in common and we don't hang out, out side of school together, we have a lot of laughter in our friendship. I say that if you are gonna have a friendship that is gonna last, you have to have laughter in it to make it a fun friendship. When @PERSON and I where in @NUM grade, we where the biggest people to the sixth graders because we where in the highest grade in our middle school. We would have so much stuff to do. @PERSON and I would always walk down the hallways linking our arms together and one moment after another she would just push me into someone. That someone would plow into a locker or wall and we would just laugh are butts off. It was fun to us but the other people kinda minded, but not that bad.  Another thing we would do to make our self laugh would be when @PERSON and I would have big tickle fights. It would always start with one of us trying to stick something in each others mouths. I would always try to stick a piece of paper in her mouth and to get me to stop, @PERSON would tickle me. @PERSON new that I'm like the ticklish person on the face of the planet. One time that happened was when we where in front of the office at our school. We tickled and tickled each other till we where laughing our butts off on the flour. Well a teacher came and told us to stop and then the bell rang and so we just went to our classes. Well @PERSON was the office aid and so when she went to the office, apparently one of the office people saw us tickling each other and thought we where going out. @PERSON told me that she just said ""@CAPS"" and started to chuckle. I got a big laugh out of that. Laughter is a vary good thing to me because without it, @PERSON and I wouldn't be best friends as we are today in @NUM grade. You see, our friendship all started off of laughter. I met @PERSON in the sixth grade @CAPS class. Our teacher had assigned seats and @PERSON and I and two other people had to sit together. I had no idea who she was at the time. We ended up saying something and laughing about it and soon enough she introduced her self and so did I. Well the seating arrangement changed and she sat somewhere ells and so did I. Well the person she sat by moved away. I had a bad grade in @CAPS class and I told my teacher I wasn't getting along with the people at my table and asked if I could sit somewhere ells. He told me yes and so I went over and asked @PERSON if I could sit in the empty chair that the guy used to sit in before he moved away. She told me that she didn't care and so then on out we started hanging in school together and had so much fun.  So you see. Laughter is a grate deal in a lot of peoples life's. You need it. Without it I would of never made my best friend who I have today. I have her to thank for getting me through my tough years. Without the laughter in this world we would be lost probably.

So they took him out and they put in the other goalie and one of the other team players kicked the ball so hard it hit the goalie in the stomach. So it knocked his wind out and me and the hole soccer team started laughing because it was funny how he was jumping up and down and saying that he was going to pass out and he just got his wind knocked out of him. So then out first goalie that got injure he had to go in because no one wanted to go in as a goalie because they were to scared that they would score on them. After first half we scored @NUM goals so we won @NUM to @NUM . The reason that we where laughing at the goalie was because it was funny how he reacted when they knocked his wind out. Also because he was our friend because if he was then we wouldn't have laugh about it but after the game was over we asked him if he was alright and he said that he was just faking it even though he really wasn't.  The main reason that this was all funny was because one of our goalie got his wind knocked out and he was over reacting when he only got his wind knocked out and how he was saying that he was going to pass out and when he said it he said it with a smile on him like if he was faking it.  ,14,15,0.0,29,0.0,0.0,0.0,29.0
12346,20832,8," Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. Many times there are things that happen that make you laugh. For example; someone trips over your backpack and @CAPS fall @CAPS their face. You can't help it but laugh! Then you start feeling bad and wish you wouldn't of laughed at them for tripping, but then you start remembering how @CAPS fell and you think about it and you end up laughing so hard that you can't stop until you get in trouble. Laughter is a big part of your life that their isn't at least a time of day that you don't laugh. Everybody in my family is fun and @CAPS always make me laugh. Their isn't a time when we are quiet and one of us has to say ""awkward silence."" We are always laughing and having fun and we are never sad. Let me tell you about the one time my family was laughing when we went back in time to remember those times that we now call ""good times."" I will tell you how laughter is a big part in my family. And how embarrassment is involved. It is a beautiful sunny day @CAPS @DATE. Today was a big day for me, @ORGANIZATION. It was the day I was going to have my @CAPS party. I woke up, took a shower, went to my mom's @ORGANIZATION and sat down @CAPS a chair to have my hair done. I was wearing my @PERSON pajamas with a black shirt that said ""@CAPS @CAPS."" I got my hair done, did my make-up, put my dress @CAPS, went outside to take pictures, and got @CAPS the limousine so I could go to church. After I went to church I took pictures with my family and then went to @CAPS to take pictures at the @ORGANIZATION building. After we got back from @CAPS, I went to the @ORGANIZATION, at @CAPS, and got ready for my waltz. I did my first waltz with my court of honor; six guys and six girls and my partner. After the waltz I danced the second waltz with my dad. When I was done dancing with my dad, I got ready for the surprise dance. I started dancing with my court of honor and my partner and towards the end came the big part... I was supposed to be picked up by my girls and the guys were supposed to spell my name @CAPS ran in front of me and the girls when one of the guys, who is my uncle, ran to the right instead of the left and spelled my name wrong! The guys were supposed to spell ""@ORGANIZATION"", with two guys wearing black @CAPS each end, but @CAPS ended up spelling ""@CAPS""! One of the other guys saw the mistake right away, so he moved to the left and since my uncle didn't move to the left either, @CAPS ended up spelling ""@CAPS""! I'm am not going to lie...I saw my uncle when he was in the wrong spot because the letters were facing my way, but I could of stopped that from happening but I didn't because I couldn't! But at the end it was funny. Everybody in there started laughing and I got so embarrassed! But when I was walking off the dance floor I started laughing! Now that we think about it, that is the funniest thing that has ever happened in our family. I guess laughter really is there when something embarrassing happens. Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. But laughter is always there when we have an embarrassing moment. Laughter is always with us. It doesn't matter if we mean to or not, but we end up doing something dumb that makes us laugh. Laughter is always with me when I'm with my family. Laughter is with me because my family is fun, crazy, and cool. No matter how sad we are, it doesn't matte if we are sad because one of my family members were in a car accident or someone died, we remember the times when we were happy and when we were having fun with that person. We end up remembering the fun we had together, that we start laughing really hard! Laughter is there when we are happy, but it is also there when it is the best day of your life.

12347,20833,8," Laughter is a great thing, except for some instances. We all have been there. Having a good time with friends, laughing and making new memories. Then you take a drink of something and start laughing again. Next thing you know you're choking and can't breathe. You're coughing as much as you can, trying to stop. It's not only a little embarrassing, but it can get a little awkward too. You can't stop it, you just have to let nature take its course. Everyone stares, asking if you're alright. The moment feels like forever, and that was exactly how I felt. I have two best friends, @CAPS and @PERSON. It was during the @DATE and we decided to have ourselves a little movie night at @ORGANIZATION's house. We were fully prepared with candy, soda pops, and the best of all, pizza. It all added up for a great night. We decided to watch the movie @ORGANIZATION. It's all of our favorites, I don't think we could ever grow tired of it. @CAPS, @PERSON and I found comfortable seating arrangements and started to watch the movie. We were eating, laughing hard-core and making comments along with it. We were having a great time. Then I decided to take a drink of my @ORGANIZATION. I was about to swallow it, but just my luck, one of the funniest parts in the movie was on. I started to laugh and knew I had an issue. I put my cup on the table, quickly got off the couch, and took two steps when most of the @LOCATION in my mouth came flying out onto the floor. I couldn't breathe and was now coughing, so I kept running to my destination, the kitchen sink. I was about two feet away from the sink, I was so close! Then I felt something come up my mouth that I couldn't control. I wasn't going to open my mouth, it'd be all over the floor! I was so grossed out I basically threw myself at the sink. My mouth opened and there went the puke, into the sink. I continued to cough, wondering when it would it would all end. ""@CAPS you okay?!"" @CAPS ran into the kitchen and started hitting my upper back, trying to help me out. @CAPS hit me three times, then I could finally breathe again. ""@CAPS you, I was having a hard time."" @CAPS started laughing, while I was still disgusted with the nasty taste left in my mouth. I put my head under the faucet trying to clear it out a little. I grabbed a towel, and we made our way to the living room. We entered the room to find @PERSON sitting on the couch, laughing hysterically. @CAPS sat by her, and started to giggle a little along with her. I got on my knees and started wiping up the @ORGANIZATION spill on the floor. There wasn't too much, but still a good amount. I started to chuckle a little to myself while cleaning it up. I thought to myself, ""@CAPS must I always be the one to choke?"" ""@CAPS didn't you just go to the bathroom sink? I mean it's right there!"" @PERSON was pointing to the door and still laughing. ""I didn't think of that! I just ran for the kitchen!"" I've been to her house plenty of times before, but the bathroom slipped my mind. I laughed at how much of a blond moment I had just had. ""@CAPS my gosh,"" @CAPS laughed a little then continued, ""@CAPS me of @CAPS! When I saved you!"" ""@CAPS up and watch the movie!"" I told her jokingly. @CAPS finished laughing and we were enjoying the movie in peace again. They both still tease me about that, but I don't mind.

12348,20835,8," Has there ever been a person that you know, that just made you laugh like no one else could? Or had a moment or a @DATE when you laughed as if there was no tomorrow? Laughter is something that everyone can relate to no matter the age or the personality. It fills you with warm feeling that spills out like a waterfall. There isn't always a reason for the things that people do, there is always mystery. The same thing applies to laughter. Sometimes you are just so happy that it all builds up inside and has to be let out. During the @DATE of my sixth, going on seventh grade year, my friend @PERSON and I were nearly inseparable. @PERSON was the first friend that I had made upon moving from @LOCATION, @ORGANIZATION in the beginning of my sixth grade year, but in a short amount of time we became best friends. On @DATE, we were at my house by ourselves and we wanted to do something fun, and creative. So we decided to make a fort out of sheets and furniture. We took chairs and the ends of some couches and @DATE tables and tied sheets and blankets from them, falling over ourselves and not paying attention to anything else. We made a plane of fabric about three or four feet above the ground, tall enough to crawl under and sit down. We then took a tack in the wall and pinned a sheet to hang over the flat sheet as our walls. We then filled the make shift tent with pillows and blankets to sit on. By the @DATE of our adventure, the living room was a mess and the furniture was all over the place. It was as if a tornado had run through the house, even though it wasn't the biggest or best fort we had built. But we didn't care, we had a blast building it. I remember sitting in the fort and talking to her about anything that came up. We talked about school, people and just life in general. We made jokes like we love to do and just fed off of each others good feelings and energy. I was on cloud nine and no one was about to bring me down. That @DATE, I laughed like there was nothing wrong in the world. I was carefree and wasn't afraid to show it. We were both laughing almost constantly to the point of tears, even though, when I look back now some of the things that we laughed about, weren't all that funny. It was one of those days with the laughs that fill you up with so much energy and joy that you can't even contain yourself, and it is so contagious that others can't help but join you. We let ourselves out in cries of joy and cackles. I had never laughed so hard in my life and I never wanted it to stop. It wasn't necessarily because of something funny that @PERSON had done or said, but I was just so happy that everything seemed worthy of laughing about. And every time I started to laugh, she couldn't help but join me, and that would just set us off laughing harder. By the @DATE, we were both emotionally drained. @PERSON ended up staying the night because we never wanted the @DATE to leave. But, eventually, every @DATE ends, every morning is a new beginning and every night an @DATE to something, but when you close your eyes to sleep after a long @DATE of laughing, you feel full. Not of happiness, but of life. And that feeling, is not something that is easily taken away. So live and laugh like today is the last @DATE, and never forget the memories that you created in the times before.",20,18,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

One memory I always seem @CAPS remember though, is the first time we had gone inner-tubing together.   There have been many memories made between @PERSON and I that we remember because of the laughter we shared. Yet the memory that always remains dominate, is when we had gone inner-tubing for the first time. It was our seventh grade @DATE and we had planned on spending as much time as possible together. Now this did not really work out because I had @CAPS babysit a lot, but she was a good friend and understood. So when we did hang out it was always so much fun. Now yes, we have had our up's and down's, and that comes with any @CAPS. We got through it and ended up having one of the best summers together. That @DATE we would hang out at each others house's and go places together. Then one day @ORGANIZATION's parent's had decided that they wanted @CAPS take a trip @CAPS the lake and go boating. @PERSON's family invited me @CAPS come along, and so I asked and I was able @CAPS go with their family @CAPS the lake. I had been boating before, and @CAPS the lake that we were going too. What I was not expecting, was for @PERSON and I @CAPS go inner-tubing. It was exciting, and nerve-racking all at the same time; I had never laughed so much with @LOCATION in my life.Going inner-tubing turned out @CAPS be one of the best memories we had ever made together. During the entire @DATE whenever possible,we had gone inner-tubing, for me, the adrenaline was almost addicting. Laughing was almost always constant when boating because we just had the best time. It was our new story @CAPS tell everyone and we were both proud of it. When inner-tubing we had learned @CAPS work together and it helped our @CAPS a lot in a way. Also when inner-tubing we got @CAPS the point where we went as fast as possible and went as crazy as possible and we loved it.  That @DATE we made some of my most treasured memories, and we really owe it all @CAPS laughter. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime, and I am very grateful for that. If not for laughter I do not know where my @CAPS with @PERSON would stand. And because of that, I believe that laughter is important in any relationship or @CAPS.

Laughter will never go away and you will always have it with you to use when it is needed in a revolting moment. For example, @CAPS a month ago i was walking to the park with my brother and some friends of mine. When we arrived there were already people at the skateboarding spot we wanted to skate at. We decided no big deal we will just go on with our business and skate. ""@CAPS punks! we were here first!"" one of them said. Me and my brother started yelling back. Then one of them got in my face and started talking a bunch of trash so i said something @CAPS him that was so funny that all his friends laughed to. He was pretty pissed of but it didn't matter because we ended up skating there anyway and nothing went down.  This just comes to show that laughter can bring us all together at any giving moment. No matter the skin color or were your from you can always be funny. Some people my be funnier than others but everyone has a sense of humor within them. You can always find the time to make a joke or come up with a clever hilarious line for some one to laugh there brains out at. Laughter is the one thing you can count on in an awkward position or when you go to a new school or have never been somewhere before. Laughter can always keep you out of fights no matter what. All around the world people are laughing at this very moment and bonding by it. It is the sign of happiness and gratefulness. Laughter has a purpose and will never disappear.Laughter is bonding. Bonding is loving. Laughter is together.",17,15,0.0,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.0
12353,20841,8," As we understand the benefits of laughter, we realize that we cant live without it. Its one of those things that are always going to be with us through tough times, and the joy of life. So when people say ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", well there right! You can think anything you want to, but i want you to know that i have the best laughter in the world when it comes to the boy i have fallen for.  It all started on a softball tournament in bend. Our team drove there for the weekend to play our tournament and we stayed in the @LOCATION inn hotel. Which was very nice by the way, probably to nice for our team, because we end up destroying the place like a bunch of football players in a locker room, hence the hard practices. After our practice we go ahead and swim in the pool, even know we have a big game the next day. The hotel had two big pools, one outside, and one inside with a sauna. We all go to the inside pool because in was way to cold outside. Then everything from there was a little different. My friend @PERSON and I go into the sauna after swimming to relax and just talk a bit. After a while two boys about our age enter the sauna while we were still in there. They acted as if they were nervous and shy, so they sat down and started talking to us which was kind of awkward, no doubt. When it comes to boys I'm not shy to just speak my mind and to ask them why the hell there just sitting there pretending to mind there own business, and i know for a fact that's not why. We talk a laugh for a bit and got to know each other. One of them was extremely adorable and i hit it off with him very well. It got later into the @TIME and it was time for all of us to head back to our rooms and say good bye for ever. Me and @PERSON shared a room with her parents. I had know idea that @PERSON gave my number to @PERSON, the guy i kind of liked in the sauna. About ten minutes later i get a text saying ""meet me outside to walk around"". So i amused that it was him, and i got all excited! so we snuck out of the room for the @TIME. All we did was walk around the hotel and talk, he was barefooted and as cute as can be. I never laughed so hard in my life! He made me smile and feel like i could con-core everything that came my way.  About forty five minutes past, still gazing into each others eyes, feeling like it as only been a second. His friend @PERSON sees someone walking out a the hotel room and realizes that its his mom. They bolt off saying there goodbyes and at the last second he kisses me on the cheek for his farewell. Never in my life have i experienced something so exciting and fun, and most of all i understand the importance of laughter. Knowing that i would never see him again is what kills me. He lives in @CAPS and i live in @LOCATION. How could anything possibly happen between us? Maybe some day i will meet him again. Maybe someday i would be able to talk to him again like we did that @TIME, and just maybe, will i fall in love with him. All those maybe's have came true, because i fallowed what was right and i waited. Now sense that all happened i can ponder and relate to laughter and how it effected me in life. That is what brought us together, and I'm happy that all of that could happen so quick in my young life.",17,16,0.0,33,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.0
12354,20842,8," I kept my head low as I walked through the halls of the brand new school I'd been signed up to attend. Students passed me with warm smiles, but I didn't dare meet their gazes, I couldn't. This is what real school is like, I thought to myself. I'd always been home schooled, since before I could remember, and now my parents felt that I should be introduced to a public school, in my last year of middle school @CAPS less. My dark, curly brown hair fell into my face as I entered my first class, acting. The room was warm and dimly lit as students began to recite their lines; the sets were colorful and I instantly recognized them as the garden from @LOCATION in @LOCATION. I suddenly let out a small yelp as my foot caught in the doorstop, sending me tumbling into a chair.  Deep red color flooded to my cheeks as I looked up and realized that every student in the room was staring at me. I let out a troubled sigh and brushed my hair over my face, wishing I was back home, in my favorite chair studying for my mother's vocabulary tests. I glanced up through my hair and a quick smile flashed across my face as I realized I was @CAPS longer the center of attention.  ""@CAPS, you must be @CAPS, the new student."" @PERSON said warmly.  I smiled and nodded my head slowly, ""@CAPS, that would be me.""  @CAPS smiled at me just as I'd smiled at @CAPS, but @CAPS smile seemed sad, ""I'm sorry dear, but all the parts for this play have been taken, but you are more than welcome to help paint the sets next class.""  I nodded and reached into my backpack, pulling out a book and quickly buried my nose into the pages of my favorite romance novel. I was instantly taken to another time and place, and I wished with all my heart that I could truly go there. I was suddenly jerked from my imagination when a small pixie looking girl took a seat beside me.  @CAPS didn't say anything for a moment, just looking at me. @CAPS hair was a few shades darker than mine, more black than brown but @CAPS wore @CAPS @CAPS. @CAPS bright blue eyes twinkled with imagination, as did @CAPS face. Something about @CAPS seemed kind. Maybe @CAPS was the way @CAPS dimples came out even though @CAPS wasn't smiling, or @CAPS could have been the way @CAPS sat, tall with confidence.  ""@CAPS, hello?"" I murmured, closing my book, careful to mark the page. ""I didn't mean to interrupt, but you looked all alone, and I thought I'd come over and say hello. My name is @CAPS, but everyone calls me @CAPS."" @CAPS said with another smile, making @CAPS dimples come out even more. I chuckled softly and returned @CAPS smile, ""@CAPS, I'm @CAPS, nice to meet you.""  ""@CAPS, don't take this the wrong way, but you aren't from around here, are you?"" @CAPS asked hesitantly. My smile fell slightly, ""@CAPS, I've always been home schooled, I've never actually been to a public school before.""  @CAPS smile fell with my own, and i could tell that @CAPS knew what I was talking about.  ""@CAPS's not always a bad thing though, I'm glad that I'm finally getting to go to a public school."" I murmured, the lie coming easily.  @CAPS laughed and layed a soft hand on my shoulder, ""@CAPS need to lie,""  I knew that half of @CAPS words were serious, and the others playful but something deep inside of me shifted. I barely knew this girl but I felt that I could trust @CAPS, and that we could be friends.  We laughed and joked the rest of the class, and I was almost always caught up in the way that @CAPS constantly got flustered while trying to explain things to me. @CAPS'd try and use @CAPS hands, make movements, just to explain, which always took us into a new round of giggles because of how ridiculous we both were acting and I was startled when the bell for lunch rang, had time really passed that fast? @CAPS smiled at me, ""@CAPS for lunch @CAPS?"" A smile broke out across my face, maybe I wasn't as alone as I'd thought. With just a few giggles and laughs, an entire friendship was planted in a ground that I'd thought was to stony to hold any life at all. By just opening myself up a little bit, and showing a side of vulnerability and even fear, I'd opened the doorway to an entire future of conversations, to smiles, tears, secrets but above all, hope. This place was @CAPS longer a place of torture, exclusion and sadness, but a place where I could go to see my new friend, a friend who eventually became my sister, a woman who I began to trust and understand with all my heart, and I finally came to realize that we weren't as different as I'd once thought. We were one and the same all along.",21,14,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12355,20844,8," I'm a tell you about moments sometimes even adventures with a boy named @CAPS.C. @CAPS has brown hair that is up to his neck, that @CAPS loves to swoosh around like in the movies. @CAPS most definitely doesn't like his bangs cut to short other wise the swoosh will not turn out the same way. @CAPS has brown eyes that just seem to sparkle and a smile that seems to fool everyone. ""@CAPS, @CAPS's so adorable"", they say.""@CAPS, @CAPS so cute"", they say.@CAPS.C is cute, but does things that will amaze you! Things you wouldn't think a kid his age could make possible. Like i always say, ""@CAPS'll make you work for your money!""The thing is @CAPS's only @NUM years of age, well right now @CAPS. @CAPS loves the attention, @CAPS'll do almost anything for it. Yet @CAPS's very lovable and sometimes sweet.@CAPS loves comedy, cartoons, candy, video games, the works. @CAPS.C is lots of fun believe me when i say you'll never get bored! I think when @CAPS was @NUM 1/@NUM when the adventures began. @CAPS would always go in the refrigerator and just @CAPS at the egg cartons and double check if anyone was around. Then @CAPS'd grab one and toss it and say, ""@CAPS, chicken?"" with a baby type accent, so adorable! but @CAPS'd try another and another and another until all the eggs were splattered all over the place. @CAPS'd run off knowing we're coming to close to him and hide. I must admit i didn't know who was doing all this at first. I kind of thought it was @CAPS.C, but wasn't too sure. That was only one mischief.@CAPS also loved this aquarium that was there, very bright because of the light it just seem to attract him. @CAPS'd get closer and closer and just @CAPS at the fishes. Watching them swim, all the different pretty colors. The rocks and the little toys seemed to attract him more. When @CAPS one was around @CAPS'd @CAPS above the tank and stick his hand in very carefully and say,""@CAPS!""trying to attempt to grab it, but @CAPS success. When @CAPS heard that someone was coming or getting closer to him @CAPS'd run so fast like the bird cartoon from loony toons always out smarting the coyote. There would be a mess, of course. Though everyone knew @CAPS'd be trouble once @CAPS'd start walking! @CAPS was so cute though.Now when @CAPS was between the ages @NUM and @NUM, @CAPS just loved picking at people just for the fun of it, or so we thought. @CAPS do it for the attention so we'd go drop what were doing and go run after him. What @CAPS'd do was grab something that was valuable to a certain person and go up to them and say, ""@CAPS! me have, me have.""Of course, we had to go run after him, but sometimes you'd have to be careful because if not @CAPS'd toss if and wham! It would brake. there's only a few things I'm pointing out here, but in reality there was much more and it was ore exciting then might be explaining it! age @NUM was a workout! One day we decide to lend @CAPS.C our @CAPS touch to entertain him because we were busy doing our own things and @CAPS.C discovers you tube! @CAPS loves this show called @CAPS and @CAPS! In other words @CAPS calls it, ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS.""@CAPS @CAPS'd go on it and watch most of the t.v shows on the @CAPS touch and use the apps on it! @CAPS is very smart when it comes to using electronics if i @MONTH add. The day after that @CAPS'd ask for the @CAPS touch almost frequently then every time @CAPS was denied of using it, @CAPS'd go to his methods in getting it! Of course what @CAPS did was, when lights were out and everyone was asleep @CAPS'd @CAPS all over, when finally @CAPS'd @CAPS under the pillows and grab them and take it with him. The very next morning we were after him! @CAPS told us, but yet again @CAPS would do it! Then we went to drastic measures we hid the @CAPS touches else where. now at @NUM years of age! whoa, well @CAPS in my opinion I think @CAPS calmed down a little more. Others @MONTH not think so, but i know so! Anyways @CAPS is now @NUM which means @CAPS is now starting school! which i hear is quite entertaining for those who are not involved! They love @CAPS.C but sometimes @CAPS can be a little too much, ha. @CAPS loves roaming around doing what @CAPS loves most and just having a great time, which i admire. well if i were to say one little short story about him as a @NUM year old I'd pick, how @CAPS matter what @CAPS'd always defend his brothers! @CAPS wont let @CAPS one bully his brothers, @CAPS matter what the odds! i admire most about him is that!",15,16,30.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12356,20846,8," Laughter is a symbol of joy and happiness. It is to become amused or derisive. Many people today make jokes or funny remarks just to hear somebody laugh. It is never something we should take for granted. Through many relationships no matter what kind, I believe laughter takes up at least @PERCENT of your relationship. It's to show the best out of someone and to let them know you are listening. There are plenty of other reasons in this world needed for laughter. ""I'm sure you can even think of one"".  In my views of this world and our society today, I believe laughter is what makes up our ""human"" spirit. It's to show ourselves and other people the spark we have inside us. Have you ever sat and pondered why we make each other laugh? I have asked myself this same question over and over. For me making people laugh is letting them know I care and to also think I'm funny as well. We even do it just the fact of wanting people to like us better and to be known as funny, hilarious, or just a good person to talk to. Sometimes we can go to the extremes of being to funny, and feeling guilty for picking on someone in a laughable way.  I remember in the eighth grade, I was thirteen years old. I was really shy and didn't have much friends. One day in class some of the popular kids actually came over and started talking to me. I was @CAPS excited and nervous that other kids wanted to talk to me. Of course they were laughing and making jokes, not caring what anyone else was saying. Then this one girl started talking about other people like she knew everything. When she started talking about my best friend it made me angry but happy at the same time, because some of the things she was saying were true. That's were I messed up, I started talking about all the other dumb things she did, just to make everybody else laugh. As I was sitting there all I felt was guilt and disappointment in myself. I couldn't believe I was sitting there talking about my best friend, just to try and make myself popular. Later that day she came up to me really upset and couldn't understand why I would do that to her. I told her I was sorry and that I only did it to make myself popular and seem funny to other kids. We didn't talk for almost two weeks. @CAPS I tried to do everything in my own possible way to get my best friend back. It did take me awhile, but she finally came around and forgave me. It was a good life lesson for me, knowing laughter @MONTH not always be a good thing. Now me and my friend are juniors in high school and when we think back on that day. We both together can share a laugh. In conclusion, you can see how laughter can bring somebody up and tear them down. I have experienced these things as well in my life time. Laughter has made me stronger and to be a better person, even if it means turning down popular kids @CAPS you don't hurt those closest to you.""@CAPS go out and make somebody laugh today"".",20,18,34.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12357,20847,8," Laughter is very important in my life. I laugh everyday. People wouldn't be the same without laughter, and the world wouldn't be the same. Two days ago, my @CAPS class went to the computer lab to type our @CAPS writing test. Much of the class was groaning about having to write this essay. I was annoyed because I already had passed the essay, and I didn't want to take it again, but I had to. Once I got to the computer lab, I sat in my chair and logged into my account.  After a few minutes my computer finally loaded, and I could log into @CAPS. Once I got there I logged in, and my computer froze. I had noticed that some of the other students computers had also frozen. I laughed at them for their computer being frozen, and they laughed at me because mine was frozen. After a few minutes my account finally logged in, and I selected to take the essay. After my computer being frozen for a few minutes, I got an error message, and it logged me out of @CAPS. This had also happened to @MONTH of the other students, and I laughed because of my my classmate's computer was still frozen and the screen was white. I logged back in and it froze for a while.  I tried logging in again, but kept getting different errors. I noticed that many of my other classmates also had gotten these error messages, or their computers were still frozen. After a few attempts, my test finally loaded, and I could begin the test. After debating for a moment, my teacher told the whole class to log off because only a few members had been able to make it to the test. I then logged off, and logged back into @CAPS. My computer started to log me in, but then it froze and logged me out of @CAPS. This had also happened to many of the other students taking the test. After trying to log in, the farthest I could reach was waiting for my @CAPS to approve me. My @CAPS said that he had approved me several time,s but nothing had worked.  After a few minutes of my computer not letting take the test, I logged off of my account, and got back on. At this time, I was laughing because it had worked before, but I wasn't able to get back to my test. By now over half the period had gone by. No one, not even the @CAPS, knew what was going on, but very few people had started their test. After a few more tries, and nothing being able to work, the class was almost over. My @CAPS told us to log off the computers and wait for another day to complete this test. When I walked into the room, I thought it was going to a very boring period. I was wrong, in a good way. The class wasn't boring, and I spent much of it laughing.Although I didn't get my essay done, it was a good class.

12358,20848,8," Laughter is something everyone needs in their life. We all need some humor, and even sometimes, we need to laugh at ourselves. You need a laugh, a smile and a sense of humor to live life to it's fullest. When people take things other have said, differently, or even thinking a joke was said way too harsh, and they take it the wrong way. People told me, ""you need a sense of humor, you know?"" @CAPS, I feel bad for taking it too seriously. Back, my sophomore year, I was going through a rough time. With friends, and family becoming more and more apart from each other. I don't even remember laughing or smiling last year. Let's just say, through the first four to five months of sophomore year, it was hard trying to crack at a simple joke. Once, sophomore year was coming to a close, I realized there was more to life @CAPS moping around in my own self-pity. It was getting close to @DATE vacation and I know I wanted to make @DATE, and my junior year, my year, and that no one would ruin it for me. After from being all sad and not having any fun, and laughing at the jokes my dad made about me, I know I needed to hang out with him a lot more. When my dad and I hung out, we had more laughs @CAPS I couldn't even remember having. It was a really good memory to have. Especially with my dad. My self-esteem was getting a lot better @CAPS it use to be. I was really happy with myself that I only tried once, and now I had a better relationship with my dad, too. So far, life was going great for me. I realized that I was more happy when I recognized myself and told people the real truth about me. I have to say, I never smiled, nor laughed as much as I did in a while. The truth about me was that I was diagnosed with gender identity disorder. I didn't go through any therapy, I just knew it was the real me, and it was probably why I was so sad my sophomore year. When I discovered myself, I knew there was a lot more to life @CAPS getting a better reputation. I was able to smile a lot more and just appreciate everything and everyone wanting to become my friend, or even get to know me a lot more. It was a really good feeling knowing that people wanted to be interested in me a lot more and would ask me questions about who I wanted to be called, and what a trans-gender was. I felt wanted, interesting, secure, and most of all; happy. I know I was going to get more harassment down the road from coming out. I got a lot of restricted numbers calling me and I laughed at all of them who sent me hate mail, calls, and text messages. It was really worth the laugh, because I knew what I was talking about and they didn't know a thing about transgenders, or gender identity disorder. Hanging out with my dad and more friends really paid off. I survived through a hot @DATE and now it was time for school. I was really excited for it to start, and even more excited for the sports ahead of me. I knew I was gonna kick butt my junior year and not let anyone get in the way of it. When it was around my birthday, like, a month into the school year, I realized I needed someone there all the time to just make me laugh and smile all the time. Not that I wasn't smiling or laughing, I just know I needed it more in my life. There was a girl that started talking to me on @CAPS-book. She was really cute, her personality fit her so well and already she knew how to make me smile so big, my cheeks would end up burning. Her name was @PERSON, and that also fit her, everything was just so great about her. We ended up talking on the phone at twelve, in the @TIME, on my birthday. By far, that was the best night I had in a while and the sweetest thing anyone has every done for me. @PERSON and I hung out that weekend at @CAPS @CAPS, in @LOCATION. When we headed up there her friend, @PERSON, was singing to the songs by @CAPS, while @PERSON mocked her squeaky voice. I never laughed so hard that my stomach would cringe in pain. So, you see, having a lot of people there to make you laugh is a really amazing feeling to have. You even have to laugh at yourself and make fun of how idiotic you sounded. Getting to know someone new is a perfect feeling, especially when they make your heart melt, and give you butterflies every time they say something sweet to you. Even just to make your @CAPS light up with a smile.",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12359,20849,8," In a relationship you should be able to trust in each other, confide in each other, talk with each other, cry with each other and most importantly laugh with each other. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of relationships, and I can definitely agree with that statement. The relationship in my life that I totally get the most laughter out of is the relationship between me and my best friend, and boyfriend, @PERSON. He can always make me laugh, even on my worst days he can find a smile and a little giggle. I constantly thank @CAPS for putting him in my life.  The first thing that I really noticed about @PERSON when I started to get to know him better, is that he can always make me laugh. Whether he is making totally weird faces at me or tickling me until I can barely breath, he always knows how to get me laughing. When I am balling my eyes out to him, even then he can get me to giggle. Just @TIME I had had a terrible day at school and within a few minutes of me crying to him, he had cheered me up and got me to laugh. In church or with friends we will just look at each other and make a face and start laughing, there's something about those blue eyes and that dorky smile that will always make me laugh. Our ability to laugh with each other has been a great aspect of our relationship since the beginning. When we play @CAPS, or he plays and I fail at attempting to play, we always laugh at how bad I am at it, or when I finally do get an awesome kill. ""That just works out, don't it!"" is one of our inside jokes, obviously it's not all that funny but we have fun competing at who can say it the most in one day. The rule is you have to have a good reason for saying it and if we say it at the same time we always playfully argue over who won or gets ""the point"" (as if we actually keep score) but that usually gets us laughing at some stupid excuse or reasoning that one of us tries to use. When ever there is a camera around @PERSON likes to make funny faces, which will always get me laughing. Then we usually end up taking somewhere around twenty silly pictures and just going through them and laughing and laughing at all of the weird faces we decide to make. When one of us starts laughing it usually gets the other one laughing too, they do say laughter is contagious. To be truly comfortable with and around each other you have to be able to laugh at your self. One time, @PERSON his little sisters, @PERSON and @PERSON and I were all seeing how high we could kick and long story short I kneed myself in the forehead, @PERSON was the only one who noticed or heard the crack of my bones hitting each other with force, and he just got silent until I started cracking up. Then he made sure I was okay. We were laughing so hard we cried and I had a big red circle on my forehead, not to mention my cheeks were bright red from embarrassment too, but I just laughed it off. Another time we were goofing around on the hard wood floor at his house and I pushed him to the ground, his whole family was cracking up and his face was bright red, but he just laughed it off. Whether we say or do something stupid in front of each other we both have the ability to laugh it off.  Even when things get rough our you disagree on something it is always good to later be able to look back on it and laugh about it with each other. Just because @PERSON and I are best friends doesn't mean we agree on everything, we actually disagree about a lot of things most are small but once in a while we will disagree on something a little bigger. At times one of us will do or say something that upsets the other one, we are always able to work it out and later look back on it and laugh even when it is a touchy subject. Both of us have made mistakes in our past too but again we just look back and laugh.  Obviously I have reason too agree with the statement ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" because I have that connection in the best way possible. I am so thankful to have @PERSON in my life, his ability to laugh and make me laugh is what made me fall for him in the first place. So between ""@CAPS"" over a text message, cracking up at weird things we do or just watching a movie, we are always laughing at each other or with each other. As we both would put it ""were freaking soul mates!""",21,23,0.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.0,44.0

Together we can chane any situation into a happy one. What i'm trying to say is that laughter is a very powerful thing @CAPS by making someone laugh, you can change their mood, their day or in some cases maybe change their whole life. People say that laughter is very contagous. I beleive that is true. Take comedians for example, they can take any situation and make a whole room burst with laughter. My favorite one is when this one comedian said ""@CAPS @CAPS shivering in the cold, we will bring him silver and gold"", like the song. He then said "" @CAPS don't they @CAPS bring him some blankets, I meen come on, the poor kid is going to die of hypothermia but at least he will be rich when he does"". I wrote this paper to show how powerful laughter is in the world. I beleive that everyone should laugh at least once a day to make the world a brighter place.   I conclude with this "" A smile can light up a room but laughter can change the world into a happier place"". Nobody should go through life without laughter.

I was walking out of @ORGANIZATION's @CAPS, @CAPS was walking in. We bumped right into each other. First, we were both mad at each other and just saying, ""@CAPS watch where your going!"" @CAPS we both calmed down we went our separate ways. I went to the food court and not even ten minutes behind me she was right there. We both waited in the @ORGANIZATION line. @CAPS and I just stood by each other for awhile, until I apologized for running into her earlier. She said, ""@CAPS its @CAPS, I should of been watching where I was going other then watching the floor, as I walk."" We laughed for a little while until it was our turn to get some food. After we payed, I asked her if she would like to sit with me because we were both alone at the time. The reason why we were alone was because both of our parents were doing more shopping. We started to talk about where we were from and what schools we go to. @CAPS goes to a private @ORGANIZATION @NUM in @LOCATION, @ORGANIZATION. I have told her I went to @ORGANIZATION. We were both in our freshmen year of @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION and we both loved band. @CAPS and I have just noticed that we have meet before once at a band competition. We have bumped into each other before the same way at least a year ago before bumping into each other again. As she was coming out of one of the rooms where her band was warming up. I was just coming across the room to get to the room where my band was warming up in two doors down. I was just walking, just like @CAPS was just walking in the @ORGANIZATION, I was watching the floor as I walked. Also, we both got mad each other as well. We both just laughed for awhile just laughing how we did the same thing, but the other way to each other before. We both have changed a lot and we both knew we would be very good friends. I guess having laughter with someone you can tell if you well be good friends or not. Laughter is a big deal in friendship. I mean whats the point of having a friend @CAPS you don't even have laughter once in awhile and have awesome memories with each other. I still hang out with @CAPS until this very day and we still can't believe that we meet twice in the same way.",15,17,0.0,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.0
12362,20852,8," Laughter is a very important part of life, for many different reasons. Some @MONTH say that its vital to survive, one needs laughter to have a full and rich life. Sometimes laughter can hurt more than it helps. This is a statement I myself believe, and have concluded from the actions and outcomes in my life. Laughter can show emotions towards a statement, or lack of emotions. Laughter can make someone either depressed or happy. It is true when someone says there is a difference when someone is laughing at you, as opposed to someone laughing with you. When a friend or a group of friends laugh with me, its an amazing, self esteem raising emotion. This laughter brings friends closer, and causes us to trust each other more. One time I thought laughing was appropriate at the time but then later felt awful. One scorching @DATE day my friends and I decided to venture to the mall, being we lived in apartments and lacked the money for an air conditioner. We all agreed it was a splendid idea. When we reached the mall we were relieved by the cool breeze as the doors swung open, as if to greet us. All of us are very introverted so shopping around in an over crowded mall wasn't our cup of tea. Not knowing what to @CAPS we sat on a bench and did what we call people watching. Their was this girl, I will always remember her; @CAPS was one of those girls you peer at just for a minute and you know @CAPS was rich. A sort of stuck up girl, a walk where @CAPS means to exaggerate her hips and bounce her perfect bleach blond hair.  The girl passed by us and stuck her nose in the air as if we were not even remotely good enough to be in her presence. Quite a bit angry I stood up after @CAPS strolled past and mocked her strut. My friends found this hysterical. Roars of laughter leaped from their mouths. The pressy girl stopped proceeding forward and then started approaching us. @CAPS grimaces at us all snobby-like and says, ""@CAPS you guys like have a problem or something?"" @CAPS covered my face, I didn't know what to say. Fortunately my best friend stepped in and said, ""@CAPS, we think your dress is very pretty."" @CAPS believed us, then walked off, in a rather less snobby sort of way.  Through this weird and interesting experience my friends and I learned a lot. One, people can hear you talking crap about them from a mile away. Two, laughter can bring friends together, but can also have some consequences. I @CAPS not know for sure if @CAPS did hear or see us mocking her. But I knew inside I felt a little bad. Sure laughing at her in the time felt right, amusing. Looking back on it, I feel awful. I have been in that same situation but on the receiving end. It is not pleasant having people talking crap about you behind your back and laughing uncontrollably. Laughing is very vital to life but needs to be appropriate.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

Lift heavy spirts to new heights, and it can also create great devotion, to a person, thing or cause. So what has laughter done for you and I? Well it has done lots for me, a good example would be my experience in the @ORGANIZATION.  At @CAPS middle @ORGANIZATION I had everything going for me. I had good grades, teachers, but most of all a group of friends that I could share many laughs with. When we graduated and went to @ORGANIZATION my friends either moved or dispersed into other groups. It was horrible not to have anyone to laugh with, making things pretty tough. Then came the @LOCATION @CAPS program, or @ORGANIZATION.  Since I wasn't really envoled in the program I didn't have any friends, save vanecek. Then an opportunity it join the @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION arose, I took it. Every afternoon for one hour we had practice, which in turn created a strong bond between the @ORGANIZATION members. Before shooting we would laugh it up and relax, making it a fun enviroment to shoot. The @ORGANIZATION quickly earned the nickname, @CAPS @CAPS, due to all the laughter heard outside the range. The @ORGANIZATION, which my battalion as a part of, hosts five competitions a year. With fourteen schools from across @LOCATION and @LOCATION competing, I got pretty nervous. Before our first competition we had been with one another long enough to consider one another family. My family, seeing how I was nervous, took me aside the night before the shoot-out. We played cards, talked and cracked jokes, it was the one of the most special times of my life. We shot early the next morning, I wasn't nervous just relaxed. Out of twenty four man teams we took third, not bad for a new famliy. Since then the @ORGANIZATION has taken first, four times in a row. Those victories I have to give credit to the simple human emotion of laughter. Laughter in a way has inspired me to devote myself to a family, and has taken me to new heights. I guess my question for you would be, what @CAPS @CAPS are you part of?",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

I was having @CAPS friends @PERSON, @PERSON and @CAPS neighbor @PERSON stay the night at @CAPS house. @CAPS ever we got bored we usually went around @CAPS neighborhood ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS"" some houses to have some fun. ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS"" is @CAPS @CAPS quietly sneak up to someones front door, ring the door bell a couple times and then @CAPS run away. All four of us were hanging out that day. It was a great @DATE day, gorgeous sun, warm temperature and a nice gentle breeze to cool off your face.@CAPS it came to night fall we were all in @CAPS room playing @CAPS @NUM.  ""I'm bored bro,"" @PERSON said to the other three of us.  ""@CAPS then, think of something to @CAPS,""@CAPS replied  ""I can't think of anything,"" @PERSON stated with a bored look on his face. We sat for a while thinking of something to @CAPS to entertain the four of us. ""I got it!"" I said with a confident smirk ,""lets go @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS!"" "" I down for that ,""@PERSON said ""@CAPS me too ,""@CAPS and @PERSON replied shortly after @PERSON.

I didn't know what to say ,""uh, we are going on a walk ,""I replied hesitantly.  ""@CAPS be safe,"" @CAPS mom said as I walked out of the door. We @CAPS @CAPS ditched a couple house, but that was starting to get boring and then it hit me like a typhoon. I came up with the best idea I have thought of yet.  ""@CAPS this is what needs to happen, I'm going to @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS the first house, @PERSON @CAPS get the next one, @PERSON @CAPS get the house at the corner and @PERSON will run around the corner to get the last house.

We all lined up in place. I rang the first door bell and started running, then I saw @PERSON slam his clinched fist on the second door, next i didn't see @PERSON ring the door bell because he was already running ahead of me.  ""@CAPS get the last house!"" I shouted at him. The house @CAPS was running to did not have their porch light on. @CAPS was running fast to the house and failed the see the step up in front of the door. I didn't expect what happened next. SMACK! @CAPS tripped over the step up and hit his face on the screen door. I could hear the slam from the middle of the dark street.  He got up quickly and turn to us in confusion ,""should I ring the door bell? Should I ring it?""  ""@CAPS run @CAPS I'm sure they would hear @CAPS smack their screen door with your face!"" @CAPS we got back to @CAPS house everyone was laughing. @CAPS @CAPS made our night.

12366,20859,8," ""@CAPS ma, do you know where my purse is."" I wonder where it is, I need to put my license in my wallet. I kept looking around and found it in my room under all my dirty clothes. A sigh of relief came over me, I was glad I found it before something happened. I woke up @DATE @TIME and figured it would be just another day. I had plans to go to a basketball game after school. It was the biggest game of the season, we were playing our rivals, the @CAPS @CAPS. The day was going by slow though, I couldn't wait until it was over. Finally the bell rang, school was over, I drove home a little disappointed. I wasn't sure if my friends were going to the game with me, if they didn't go I probably wouldn't either. I was determined though, I texted them at five and convinced them it would be fun. I picked up my friend @PERSON first, then @PERSON.  This is when my normal day turned into one of the most eventful days ever. The @ORGANIZATION (where the game was being held) was about twenty minutes away, I had to stop and get gas before we left. We went to the cheapest spot in town and filled up my car. When it was time to leave, my car decided not to start. I have an old car and it doesn't start all the time, it just sits there for a while until it wants to start. There were some guys in the other lane that we new staring at us. We just started laughing it was really embarrassing. The attendant asked us if we needed something else and I said no, my car just wasn't starting. I tried turning it on again, but it just kept dieing. Out of all the other days my car decided not to start, today. Then some men came out and told me that they had to move my car I got so embarrassed and starting laughing again. I always laugh when I get nervous. I told them to let me try turning on my car once more, I prayed my car would turn on this time. It did, I was so relieved and embarrassed, I left as soon as I could.  Twenty minutes later we were in @ORGANIZATION in front of the school, and just my luck again, no parking spots. We drove around for about five minutes until we found one that was walking distance. Then we gathered our things and walked to the game. It hadn't started yet but it was about to, I had a feeling it would be a really close game. Soon the game began and just how I figured, the game kept going back and forth, we got a point, they got a point. It was really exciting but there where two parents behind us that were really into the game. They kept shouting at players, shouting at the referee, and just being annoying. The game was good, but in the end The @CAPS @CAPS won by @CAPS points. It was a little disappointing, but The @ORGANIZATION did have a good team.   After the game we were going to eat at @ORGANIZATION. We left the game quickly after it was over so we wouldn't get stuck in traffic. I was driving down this road I thought I new but then I realized I didn't recognize it at all. @PERSON told me to keep going she new where we were. I stayed on the road and luckily it took us straight to down town by @CAPS. I got onto one of the main roads and headed to @ORGANIZATION. The road I was on had a million stop lights though, and I was stopping every @NUM minutes. Then a pedestrian decided to cross the street in front of me, I waited for him to cross even though he wasn't even on a crosswalk. I kept going no worries on my mind, music blasting, when suddenly rainbow lights behind me. This day couldn't get any worse, I pulled over and waited for the @CAPS to come up to my window. He asked for my license and registration. I got my purse and looked in my wallet. My heart pounded where was my license i had just put it in my purse a few days ago. I started to panic and laughter filled the air. My nerves got to me I couldn't help it. I looked everywhere finally he asked if I had my school I.D, I went to pull it out and there was my license right underneath. He went back to his car, leaving me bursting with laughter. He came back and told me my insurance was expired, another thing that added to my day. I was still laughing when he gave me my ticket for speeding and expired insurance. I think I got it because I was laughing and he thought I was taking it as a joke. You cant control nerves though, or at least I can't.",20,23,0.0,43,0.0,0.0,0.0,43.0
12367,20860,8,"                     Laughter is a key to any happy and successful relationship in my opinion. It can break the ice in an akward situation or help you become closer to someone. Some people have said that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and that laughter is the best medicine. I believe that both of those statements are true. Personally laughter has dramatically changed many different social situations throught my @NUM years of life.  One time in particular that I remember laughter really bringing me closer together with other people is when I was camping with a few of my friends. It was three years ago in the middle of @DATE and we were all sleeping outside under the stars. We had all been talking about pretty serious stuff, family and friend problems and just sharing our hardships in general with eachother. I didn't really have much to complain about, I had a pretty average family that I loved along with good friends. However that evening I was learning some interesting but disturbing information about my friends home life. She started to talk about how her parents don't care and how they are both alcoholics, I could tell by her tone of voice how painful admitting this information was for her. The mood had suddenly changed from discussing light issues to a serious, emotional conversation. She continued to tell me how alone she felt sometimes and how she just always wished she could be with her friends because we always have a good time.   After she told me all of this we laid in silence for a while. Neither of us were asleep but I had no idea what to say. I mean how could anything I say make that situation better or help her to feel better. While we had been having this conversation our other friend had run back to the car to grab sodas and go to the bathroom. We heard her saying our names and searching for us in the dark. All of a sudden she knew where we were, she had tripped over the edge of our sleeping bag fell on us and spilled a bunch of fizzy grape soda all over our faces. Normally we would have been angry but we all thought this was hysterical. While in the midst of laughing like crazy people I looked at my friend who had just recently told me her painful story, now she was crying from laughing so hard and I knew that a little laughter had brought us closer.  That is a memory that I will never forget, it was an experience where I feel laughter has played a major role in making a relationship more comfortable and close. Similar experiences have occured throughout my whole life. Laughter is a common ground, where all people can relate to one another. Maybe it brings people closer together because when you are legitimatley laughing you are so caught up in it that you forget about everything else. All of your problems disappear.",20,18,36.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0

Being able to laugh with someone creates a bond with that person.Through laughter, I was able to become friends with a person that I can call to this day @CAPS best friend. I met the person that would later on become @CAPS best friend through one of @CAPS friends. A few friends of mine and I were hanging out and @CAPS friend, @PERSON, said, "" @CAPS know @PERSON, @CAPS should talk to a good friend of mine.""I didn'@CAPS oppose to the idea because from what @PERSON told me about her, it seemed like it would be very easy for me to get along with her. About ten minutes later, I looked down at @CAPS cell phone and noticed that I had a text message from a number that I did not know. I asked who the person was and waited for a response. Two minutes pass by and I get a message that says, ""@CAPS name is @ORGANIZATION. I am the girl the curly-headed kid sitting next to @CAPS told @CAPS about."" Once I read this I started just about busted up into a fit of laughter. Never would I have thought a girl I had never spoken to would be brave enough,or sarcastic enough, to say something like that as the first thing they would say to me. For the next few hours, we kept exchanging sarcastic remarks and jokes and the laughs just kept on coming. @ORGANIZATION is the type of person that can make anyone laugh. This is what I love about her; @CAPS possesses a talent of making anyone laugh no matter where they are, what kind of mood they are in, or what they are doing. We have walked around for hours and we have spent a majority of that time having to stop and catch our breath because we had been laughing so hard. Our ability to laugh with each other has helped us through difficult times in our lives. @ORGANIZATION's mom passed away a few years ago and this sent her into a depressive state. @CAPS rarely felt any happiness until we would talk. Our ability to start laughing at one another helped her throughout this time. I recently received a @CAPS.B.I. or @ORGANIZATION. I felt numb to the world. Nothing felt the way that it once felt. Luckily for me, @ORGANIZATION was able to come in and do what I had done for her; @CAPS was able to make me laugh and feel normal again. Having the ability to laugh with @ORGANIZATION has definitely made our friendship stronger than it would have been had we not been able to laugh together. Being able to laugh doesn'@CAPS just effect that one moment in time, nor does it just impact one person. Having laughter means so much more than that. Being able to laugh creates bonds that are simply not possible without laughter. I have felt what laughter can do to a relationship and I can say that it most definitely feels good.",19,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

Not to mention that when you're doubled over with laughter you are getting an amazing workout. Everyone that texts @MONTH use ""@CAPS"" or ""haha"" to show they think something is funny; but it is nothing compared to actually being with friends and having, ""a smile that burst.""  I couldn't wait. I was on the coast at a camp with my friends, and we were about to head-up to walk up to the three crosses. Some of the other girls were asleep and we had to leave quietly. One of the girls tripped as we were walking out the door and it took all we had to not burst out in laughter. Because when she tripped, she barely caught herself, as she was about to fall on sleeping @CAPS. Jasmine scurried out the door with the rest of us. After the door was closed, we all doubled over laughing. Jasmine's face, when she tripped was priceless.  We headed into the crisp air without looking back. From a gravel path to the cement road going up the hill, we happily skipped along. As the hill got steeper, we started walking. Jasmine, after being tired from skipping, almost fell again. Everyone started laughing again. The walk up the hill was taking longer than expected. Finally, we could see the three crosses at the top.  When we arrived at the crosses, we waited for the miraculous sunrise. We kept staring at the ocean; waiting with anticipation. Eventually, @CAPS pointed out that the sun rises on the east and would we coming over the mountains. Again, all the girls laughed because we were so tired we forgot which side the sun rose on. At last, the astonishing sunrise happened. It was full of pink, purples, yellows and oranges. After watching the sunrise we realized we still had the treacherous walk back down the hill. I peered over the edge and saw a little path. With a bunch of convincing, I got all the girls to walk down the steep hill because it looked shorter than the cement road we came up.  The first part of the path was simple. As we started heading farther down the hill it got skinnier with more brush. A couple of the girls thought we should head back up, but I convinced them otherwise. So on we went. ""@CAPS no!"" @CAPS yelled. We turned to see she had managed to let her shoe fall of into a blackberry bush. She had just gotten her shoes the day before and now they are muddy and lost. Everyone was trying to reach it, but it was just a little too far away. Suddenly, @PERSON tried to grab the shoe; immediately she fell into the blackberry bush! @PERSON forgot about her shoe for a little and started doubled over with laughter again. While flailing and screaming we yelled for her to stop because if I didn't mention this earlier; this is a very steep hill. While she was in the bush, she grabbed @PERSON's shoe. The hard part was getting @PERSON out.  The first time we tried to pull her up; we got her up a couple of inches then she fell back down, into the bush. Finally, after what felt like a million tries, we pulled her big butt out of the bush. Everyone was laughing so hard during the extravaganza. @PERSON was super embarrassed. After all of that, we headed down the hill. We still had giggles while trotting down the trail. As we went, we saw animal tracks. We then realized the trail was most likely made by animal. A couple girls joked around about being terrified of the animal tracks. Eventually, we got back to the cabin, still laughing about what had taken place. The rest of the day everyone was happy and giggly for waking up with an amazing morning.  Laughter helped the girls have a wonderful rest of the day. Laughter helped us work through the mud, the shoe losing, and the cold. With out it, we could have been very grumpy. Also, having amazing friends to laugh with was phenomenal. Laughing helps people be happy; being happy is better than being sad; therefore, laughter is important. When writing this paper to the @ORGANIZATION's in @LOCATION, I told my friends about the adventure we went on and the predicament we got ourselves into.

If I had to count how many times we've laughed about or done together i could there isn't enough time or numbers to tell you how many times.

We would be having a blast and laughing for hours.  ""@CAPS turn, @CAPS turn,"" In @DATE we were on our way to state for cheer. On the car ride up to @LOCATION, every-time we took a corner we would say what corner it was and do a motion with it. Oh @CAPS goodness we laughed and we had a blast. After the @CAPS and @CAPS turns, there was another motion we called the monkey and we would act like monkeys. It was so much fun we laughed. We also laughed so hard that we were crying and we had to go pee so bad, it was almost really bad.That was one of many car rides that was amazing.

Because this one time we stayed up past midnight and we were hungry so i went and made all of that and @PERSON loved it so now i have to make sure i have some for her when she comes over. Now we always talk about the becomes of the sandwich habit.b we laugh about it all the time.

12371,20865,8," It was some day in @DATE, I was on my way to school. My friend @PERSON was walking with me because we both lived on the same street. He lived a few houses away from me but we always walked to and from school together. Well on this particular day i decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and there was snow out. I slipped a few times but never fell. We were laughing because I would be right in the middle of saying something and id almost fall over. We got to school and he started telling everyone about it, I joined in. It was pretty funny because even at school I would almost fall over because the floors were wet from the dried snow. I thought about just walking home and changing my shoes but I would have to wait until lunch because I couldn't leave school until then or i would get in trouble. After first period I found a puddle of water and started sliding across it for fun. My friends tried doing it too but their shoes had too much traction on it. The bell rang for second period to start and I headed to my class. It was fun trying to get to class because I slid around everywhere. Once I got into class the teacher told me we where going on a field trip to the ponds. I was about to skip out on it but the teacher was walking right behind me. We boarded the bus and started heading out to the ponds. My teacher called our names out to make sure we were all there. He must have done it about every @NUM minutes. It was pretty annoying. The bus driver was playing country music too, I don't really mind country music but that day I didn't really want to listen to it. I went to get my ipod from my pocket and found out it wasn't there. I had left it at my house when I was rushing to get to school.  We finally arrived at the ponds and we unloaded the bus to begin our field trip. Our teacher told us not to go to close to the ponds because if we fell in we would be soaked and the bus driver wouldn't let us back on the bus. I thought he was just talking smack and I asked the bus driver if he was serious. The bus driver told me if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry off so we didn't get the seats wet. Again I thought it was a bunch of bull. We met up with our tour guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are used for. While walking around the ponds I started to slide on the ground. I grabbed onto my friend so I wouldn't fall over but he had pretty bad balance and we both fell over. Everyone started laughing as well as myself. My friend didn't think it was too funny at first. But once he got up he started laughing and joked about how I couldn't stand up right. On our way back to the school we talked about what we learned and if we would want to go back and learn more or even volunteer to work at the ponds. I thought it would be pretty fun if I didn't slip around the whole time. We unloaded the bus again and headed into the school. I found out the little puddle i had found earlier hadn't dried up, I got a running start and slid across it. I didn't fall over this time. The bus had brought us back just in time for the last class of the day, which unfortunately for me was @CAPS. I got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to be playing. He told me we were going upstairs on the wrestling mats to play a dodge ball game. Upstairs on the wrestling mats was a small area and we only went up there if we had a small class. I lucked out big time because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats.  I got done with @CAPS and the bell rang to tell us school was over. I got dressed into my normal clothes and headed home. My friend @PERSON was waiting outside for me. We started heading home and I slide around with every step I took. The sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it into ice. I looked over at @LOCATION and laughed. He laughed too. The whole way home I was skating on ice. It was a really fun day. Except right when I got home I fell on the deck because the step was icy.",20,18,0.0,38,0.0,0.0,0.0,38.0
12372,20866,8," It was one of those days where I just sat around all day doing nothing, but play @PERSON, text, and laugh at myself. It was one of those days where no one bothered me; no one even really talked to me; no one told me to do chores. By dinner time someone decided to call me up stairs to eat, but let me tell you, it wasn't anything like pizza. Although I'd rather eat it than get a lecture on not being thankful. My brother came home for the first time in ever, ate with us, then decided to leave again. But this time I asked to come with; I'm so tired of beating @PERSON. He said no, of coarse. I made my daddy change his mind for him, of coarse. I don't see why he wouldn't let me come in the first place. He was going to hang out with the guys I grew up with, my friends, not his. Anyways. I got ready then we hit the road. There him and I were, laughing about dinner and what kind of music my mom listens to, on our way to pick up my friends. These guys are great! All we do is crack jokes about each other and crack up. But let's get down to business. I didn't tell you this, but it's @DATE time, around The @CAPS of @DATE. Fireworks are for sale and we're creating ""bombs"" out of them. Or they are. Since I'm a girl, I guess I'm not allowed, or something lame like that. But there is this girl my brother likes and I guess he wants to impress, excuse me ""impress"" her by showing up at her house so she can see these ""master pieces"" they've made. That just makes me feel bad for him, but honestly just made me laugh. Maybe she'll be impressed. Key word: maybe. Although, no, it won't. Because to this day they are still only friends.  So about these bombs. Complete duds. We tried, well I just watched, over and over again to make 'em work, but they wouldn't do a thing. Eventually my friend @CAPS put a whole bunch of @CAPS @CAPS's into my favorite stuffed animal. It just made a bunch of sparkly colors and loud noises, but it was pretty fun to watch. We got in on video too, it was a total good laugh for everyone. After my brother said goodbye to his ""girl,"" we decided to head home. The thing is, we had so many fireworks left! We know this kid @PERSON who lives somewhere on the way home. So we decided to go by his house, have @CAPS get out of the truck, light the firework on his porch, have him jump in the tail of the trunk, then drive off as fast as we could. The first time we did it we couldn't stop laughing. They didn't come out of their house, so we did it again. They still didn't come out. We did it about one more time, by then all the neighbors were out. They were all so confused. That just made us laugh even more. It was so great we wanted to keep doing it, but to someone else this time. We know this girl @PERSON who lives near all of us. We thought, why not? It's not gonna hurt to stop there real quick and have some fun with her too. Apparently she thought different. Way different, actually she thought it was the rudest thing ever. We were just joking around, gettin' a laugh out of all our fun. We weren't being rude, she's our friend. Long story short, her mom got mad too and chased us down in her car. She never caught us, but she got our license plate number. The next day, on The @CAPS of @DATE, she called the police. They didn't think it was a big deal, but they still showed up at my house and talked to my parents about what went down. I was at my boyfriend's so lucky me I only had to talk to my mom on the phone about it. She realized we were just having fun and actually laughed about it too. That @CAPS of @DATE @CAPS was great. It was one of those nights where you laughed the whole time and wouldn't change a thing even if you got in trouble with the law for it. Something I will definitely never do again, but I'm so glad I have this hilarious memory to reminisce on for the rest of my life.",20,17,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0

They had all grown up together, and telling stories about the old days made them all want to hangout more often. They always had @CAPS much fun together. I grew up with my cousins around a lot of the time. We would always hangout. We started talking about all the crazy times we have had, and it was nice to hear abut the old days. We were just laughing up a storm. All a sudden out of @CAPS where my cousin @PERSON farts. All of us start busting up laughing. @PERSON continues to fart while she is uncontrollably laughing. @CAPS many people were looking at us in the restaurant. Here was a group of people all laughing, and one of them cannot stop farting. The laughing got louder as well as the farting. my mother could not take it anymore. She took one of the salt shakers and started pounding it on the table. She wanted to drowned out the sound of @LOCATION's farts. @PERSON was beat red. We were all laughing @CAPS hard we started crying. We were almost to the point were we were going to pee ourselves. @PERSON could not hold it any longer. She finally stopped farting, but now she had to pee @CAPS bad she could not even walk. When she got up to go to the bathroom she had to walked there cross legged, and very slowing. All the way there she was still laughing, and we were also laughing. We had fun watching her have to stop every @CAPS often @CAPS she would not pee on herself. One time that she had stop it was right on these two guys chairs. She just stood there laughing cross legged over these two guys trying her best not to pee. The guys did not really do anything they just sat there waiting for her to go away. We could tell they were very uncomfortable though. I told my mom ""I would be uncomfortable to if i had some random girl bent over me laughing, and trying not to pee. I'm surprised they did not move. i would have"".  Finally @PERSON got to the bathroom. Those two guys had left, and when she came out she was glad to see them gone. When we saw her we could not help but laugh. She laughed with us @CAPS we did not feel bad about laughing. People were still looking at us, and @PERSON was still blushing. She wanted to go @CAPS we left and talked about it the whole way home. They were coming over to our house to play bored games. When we got home my brother joined us in a game of gestures. this game is kinda like sherades. We got into teams. I was on @ORGANIZATION and my brothers team. My brother went first. He started melting to the ground. I shout out ""wicked witch of the west""! He frowns at me and says, ""@CAPS, watch before you shout things out."" @CAPS i sat there and watched. He did his whole melting thing again,but when he got to the floor he started rolling and jerking around. I was @CAPS confused. My cousins shouts out ""poop""! My brother yells ""@CAPS, why would anyone want to be poop""! We all start laughing,and he just tells us what he is. He was a waterfall.  It was my turn to go, and i got horse. I did not want to be a horse. I did not even know how to be a horse without making sound. I went up there and started hoping around like and idiot. I felt @CAPS dumb. My team mates made me feel even worse because they could not guess what i was for the life of them. The buzzer rang and we lost the game by two points. My brother hates to lose. He got really mad, and ran up the stairs. On his way up there he trips on his face, and falls down the stairs. We all started laughing, and that made my brother even more mad. He went up the stairs again without falling this time, and stayed in his room the rest of the @TIME.  The rest of us stayed downstairs, and played more games. It was a really fun day. I got to hangout with the family, and get a great laugh. hanging out with the family is something everyone should love. It is one of those things that just make you feel good.

When talking about preference in significant others it's often that people mention that they want someone who can make them laugh, this is why. this story is , however, not about dating. It is about how laughter can cause you to go from hating someone one moment to being their best friend the next.  I had known @PERSON for a while for a few months at this point, I had met him on the bus. He was pale, skinny, loud, and he always had something funny and offensive to say. He was a shut in. Before I met @PERSON I could dish it out but I couldn't take it. I remember one day, the day I went from hating him to befriending him, we were fighting about something so insignificant that I can't for the life of me remember what it was. Although I do remember what he said. He said that I was a ""hypocritical, arrogant asshole who would go around making fun jokes at other peoples expense but would get up in someones face if they tried one at me."" this made me laugh. Not because everything he said was right but because it made me realise that @PERSON was actually a pretty good guy whose only real problem was that he didn't know when to shut up. Throughout the whole time I have known @PERSON he has never stopped smiling. He laughs off everything from stepping in dog crap to his fathers drug addiction he can dull the pain of any blow with laughter. @PERSON is my constant reminder to never stof laughing.",16,15,0.0,31,0.0,0.0,0.0,31.0

There was also stress of having @CAPS fathers business being the main income, and him not being able to work. @CAPS father felt helpless, his leg was to weak for him to be doing anything.@CAPS would micromanage everything, and tell @CAPS were doing things all wrong.

Father asked asked if I could make him some oatmeal, of course with full hands I said ""@CAPS, but I will when I'm done."" @CAPS father took that as disrespect, and hobbled over to me with his crutches. @CAPS was yelling at me which was upsetting, so instead of fighting back i headed to @CAPS room.The anger in his voice was excruciating. I turned around, told him to stop yelling, and headed back to @CAPS room. That's when it happened. @CAPS father hooked the end of a little kids chair and flung it down the hallway. It bounced off the walls, breaking an outlet shell, putting a hole in the wall, and hitting @CAPS knee. I didn't say anything, being afraid of what would happen next.

She showed up an hour or so later not knowing I left a voice mail. I explained what happened, and she comforted @CAPS sister and I telling us it would be okay. @CAPS grandmother sat us all in the living room to try and resolve the situation. By then @CAPS dad had come to his senses and apologized to both of us. @CAPS used popcorn and candy to make us forgive him, then @CAPS started making fun, and jokes. Every time there is a fight or disagreeing @CAPS dad always cracks a few jokes to get us in a better mood. The one thing different this time is after @CAPS told some jokes, @CAPS apologized again.

12378,20876,8," Laughter is the cure to a sickness and the medicine to somebodies pain. Laughter can mend a friendship to make two strangers become the best of friends. A person can ask anybody on the street of how much laughter is important in life and they would say that laughter is very important. It's like love, everyone needs a little of it in their life and like laughter, it helps a person grow and become an adult. A person can use laughter to help them with anything like getting a job, or trying to get the girl, or just having a good time and making new friends. It's one of the main elements of life that make a person how they are and what they do. In the @DATE I was introduced to a girl named @DATE, by my cousin @PERSON. She started talking to me and I was shy because she was a girl and I wasn't used to talking to girls. I cracked a joke and that made her and I laugh together and that was the first icebreaker to making a new friend. The days went by and we were text messaging each other each day over the phone, making jokes about how our day was and making jokes about each other. Eventually we started talking to each other over the phone. Teens these days usually don't use the phone to call people and that makes emotions hard to understand because talking over text hides emotions from one another. @DATE called me and we would talk to each other until late in the @TIME, to where we would both fall asleep and leave the phone on, and again we would always be making jokes about everything. Making each other laugh was one of our only connections with each other since she went to a different school. Making her happy was what I needed to do, and one of the ways to make her happy was to make her laugh or just be a charming young gentlemen because I was raised that way.  @DATE formal was coming near and I was in need of a date. @DATE was my best option for a date since I was getting close to her and I was starting to get attached to her. When I had the chance I asked her to be my date for the @DATE formal which would be one of the most special nights of my freshmen year. The day of the formal came and we danced the @TIME away and of course I had to make a few jokes about other things which made everyone laugh and have a good time. Near the end of the dance I asked her to be my girlfriend and she accepted. She said I was funny, and nice, and cute which was good. We had a fun time because good humor and fun kept the @TIME alive. The next @DATE formal, the same thing happened with a different girl except that laughter was an important key and that made the @TIME so much fun. That @TIME was one of the best nights of my life that I had ever had, because we were laughing and having the best @TIME ever. Laughter is an important key in my life. I would have never gotten the girl or have had the best @TIME of my life if laughter was never involved. Laughter makes everything better and I use it in my everyday life because everybody needs to have a good laugh if they are in a bad mood. Without laughter my life would be dull and have no color that would make me who I am today. It's one of the many keys of life that everyone needs to be happy, and without it you would be less happy then you are right now. A small child could live his whole childhood without laughter or any other important element in his life and he could end up being a mean and cruel person who does not understand good values and humor. Everybody needs personality and color in their life and with out it everything id grey.

12379,20877,8," I have had many great times with my grandpa. He is a very funny and loving man. When my cousin, my grandpa and I get together for a camping trip there is trouble coming no matter what. A few years ago he took me and my cousin on a two day camping trip along the @ORGANIZATION. The first campground we arrived at had no open sites so we moved on to the next campground. @CAPS campground had tons of open campsites so we picked the best one we could find and stayed there for the first @TIME. Later that evening we learned why there was no one at the campground. The reason was that there was a racoon problem a few days before and people were scared to stay in the campground for fear of attack or having their food stolen. We were lucky and never saw the racoon and we never lost any of our food.  The next @TIME on the way out we saw a sign that read ""caution racoon problem."" @CAPS made us laugh all the way to @LOCATION, which is a small town on the @ORGANIZATION. Once in @LOCATION we stopped for gas and more food to last through the @TIME. While at the gas station we had little bit of an issue but it was very funny. A young blond woman came out to help us and she wasn't the smartest person I have met. She charged us three times the amount of gasoline than we bought and couldn't tell us where the nearest grocery store was. Well, as my grandpa is rolling up his window he mutters quite loudly ""dumb blonde"", while the woman was standing right there. She didnt say a word and my gandpa drove off with me and cousin laughing so hard we could barely breath. My grandpa asked us why we were laughing so hard, so we told him what the circumstances were when he said dumb blonde. He was so oblivious to the situation that he didn't notice what came out of his mouth at the time. What even made it better was that he drove off like nothing had happened. The next @TIME we stayed at a diiferent campground with no racoons. Still the @TIME was filled with laughter. We were roasting marshmellows over the fire after our dinner and for some odd reason my grandpa could not keep the marshmellow on his stick. He wasted about six marshmellow before he even got one that he could eat. And everytime he dropped one into the fire it got more and more funny. We laughed and laughed until our stomach hurt. The best part was theat my grandpa didn't think it was funny so he just looked at me and my cousin like we were stupid or something. In the tent that @TIME we were so tired everything seemed funny to us. We laughed at each other until two in the @TIME. Thats when everything went silent and we couldnt last any longer. We were all asleep within seconds. My cousin and I have gone camping with my grandpa every year now for about four years and each year we have an adventure filled with laughter as we go closer to each other. My grandpa is a great man and I look up to him for many things in my life. He has always keep me laughing and I try to do the same for him. He and I believe that it is important to laugh together because it keeps you smiling and helps you grow closer to whoever you are with.

12380,20878,8," ""Laughter"" I believe laughter is the shortest distance between two people. When things between you and a loved one get fuzzy making them laugh will always help break the ice. When I get angry with my boyfriend he knows that in order for me to be happy he must make me smile/laugh. That is exactly what he does. The very first time he made me angry he didn't know what to do. It was @DATE @CAPS and I had just started dating. I remember he asked me if I was hungry and I said ""no I'm not hungry,"" so he continued to ask. Since we had only been dating for a short period of time he really didn't know much about me, so he didn't know that I am a type of girl that gets annoyed easily and I have a really low temper. He continued to ask me if I was hungry, thirsty, bored, or tired but he didn't realize that at this point I was really annoyed; an hour and a half passed by and he was still asking! I was going crazy I didn't want to tell him how I felt because I knew I was going to make him feel bad, but I thought to myself and said ""no he has to know because its going to be worst if later on in the relationship he has to find out what I like and don't like on his own rather that me telling him. I went on and told him every single little detail about me good and bad, at first he just listened but towards the end he exploded and told me that why wasn't I just straight up with him from the beginning. That made me really upset, I was trying to be honest with him before anything worse happened but i guess not. I stayed quiet for the longest time and he kept asking me ""what's wrong,"" ""tell me what I did wrong"" so I told him that it really made me upset how he flipped out on me for no reason really all I was trying to do was save us from a larger argument, he looked at me and told me that I did do something wrong! He said that we had already been together for two months and it took me that long to show him my true colors I kind of understood where he was coming from but at the same time I didn't agree because by that point he should have already known. I mean it doesn't take that long to know a person especially if its your girlfriend. In the end we just agreed that we had to be ourselves around each other. He busted out saying ""ouch charlie you bit me"" in a @CAPS accent that just made me loose it I laughed for days after that and completely forgot about thee over whelming discussion we had. The point being here is that laughter is the tool to breaking the ice when things get tough and it doesn't necessarily have to be a loved one it can even be a complete stranger, if the person is shy making them laugh will help construct a great friendship with them. You can make anybody's day go great with just a little grin that you put on their face a simple ""hello"" or ""hey"" can even make them smile. I believe that a person that smiles often lives longer. This @MONTH not be true but in my little world it is. I am all about smiling, all about making people laugh. Honestly I hate seeing people walk around with angry faces like if they have no friends when all they really want is someone to make them smile-and that would be me! In conclusion, if it wasn't for laughter what relationship would still be standing at this point? None, because if your always arguing and always wining and never laughing then how do you expect your relationship to last?

12381,20879,8,"Angelina @CAPS @CAPS a year ago, some time in the @DATE, I was at my best friend @PERSON's house for a sleepover after her @CAPS party. We were exhausted from swimming at her @CAPS's pool and taking her dog for a walk, not to mention the partying, and we would have been asleep if it weren't for the family-sized bag of @CAPS and six pack of @ORGANIZATION we'd consumed not an hour before. At around three in the @TIME, our childish minds searching for something to do, we decided it was a good idea to paint the tips of our tongues blue with nail polish in hopes of them glowing in the dark when held to the black light on her windowsill. I was the first one daring enough to touch my tongue to the brush, and boy did it hurt! The acid and alcohol in the polish stung my taste buds. The next day was @DATE and, after hanging out at @LOCATION's house for the afternoon, we came to my house for another sleepover, which is what we did and sometimes still do every time we are together. That night, this time around two in the @TIME, we grew hungry again and came downstairs to get a snack before retreating back to my room and @PERSON playing on my computer while I used her phone to text my former crush. @PERSON got jars or ice water, I still don't know why she uses jars instead of cups, interrupted my spinning around the kitchen floor with my new socks, and we had a random instantaneous ice chugging contest. After ten seconds of silence, I glanced over my jar at @LOCATION, who wasn't even half done with her water. There, on her chin, was a speck, a dot, a glob, of blue nail polish. I attempted a gasp to give me enough air to start laughing at her, but instead of air coming into my windpipe, and ice cube made its way in. Choking, laughing, falling on the floor, laughing, nail polish-picking, and more laughing, we stood in the middle of the kitchen with nothing to actually laugh at that was that funny. @PERSON dropped her jar and it shattered on the floor, sending shards of glass and water across the kitchen, but that's okay. We were having fun, and, guess what, we fell asleep on the kitchen floor not ten minutes later. I suppose we were more tired then we thought. We did clean up the glass though. Some people say laughing is the best medicine a doctor can use, that it can cure any disease, that it can brighten anyone's day. Dentist's apprentices use laughing gas that makes people loopy and smile a lot when they do operations on your teeth, and it doesn't hurt as much, until the day after, but that's because you just had a tooth pulled. Today @PERSON and I are still best friends. Sure, we get in fights, but they end within a week or two. The longest fight we were ever in lasted a month and a half, and it was a misunderstood rumor another friend of mine had started, and ended by us both laughing @CAPS how stupid whatever happened really was. Within the five or six years of @PERSON and I being friends, we realized laughing is healthy and good for you, both physically and emotionally to relieve stress, so every time we see each other we laugh as much as possible. Inside jokes popping up from something said that was totally unrelated, a funny-looking person walking down the side of the road, or just our own minds saying its time to be happy again, it all triggers laughter. Sometimes it hurts, but we cant help laughing harder, because its fun.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

After we counted to about @NUM we hear screaming @PERSON shouting. My first thought was that they just got chicken @PERSON maybe wanted to freak out @PERSON @PERSON I. I was curious @CAPS I cracked the car door open @CAPS I can hear a little better about what they were saying. Sure enough here came @PERSON @PERSON rite behind her was @PERSON. @PERSON looked as if @CAPS was about to cry @PERSON @PERSON couldn't ran fast enough to get back to the car, @CAPS kept slipping @PERSON sliding everywhere all over on the road but @CAPS finally made @CAPS back @PERSON @PERSON @PERSON @PERSON crammed into the car with us. We all sat there crammed in this little car thinking about what they were running @PERSON screaming from, @CAPS me being the brave one at the moment decided to go take a look at things. Of course with @PERSON not wanting to look or feel like wimps followed close behind me. As I was walking down the road from where I saw them run from @LOCATION jumps out in front of me @PERSON says ""right over there I swear I saw something dart across the road!"" @CAPS I walked over to where @CAPS pointed @PERSON looked around thinking that @ORGANIZATION's crazy @PERSON @CAPS's just seeing things. But as I walk on, @PERSON grabs me from the back @PERSON screams. I turn around @PERSON look at her thinking ""what the heck is wrong with you people!"". @CAPS grabs me by the arm @PERSON looks up with a very frightened expression on her face. I turn toward her @PERSON ask her ""whats wrong"" @CAPS asks me, ""why does that tree look white but right there in the middle there is a big tan spot?!"" @CAPS was dark @PERSON I couldn't see very well but when I looked up I saw exactly what @PERSON was freaking out about. I go back to the car to get a flash light hoping a came see what is on the tree a little bit better @PERSON as soon as I make my way back to @PERSON by the tree, @ORGANIZATION lets out a blood curdling scream @PERSON yells ""@CAPS! Its moving, whatever @CAPS is @CAPS's moving @CAPS!"" @CAPS as I approach the girls @PERSON rips the flash light out of me hands, turns @CAPS on @PERSON points @CAPS to the tree. Sure enough there was a big tan spot @PERSON the white tree. As us girls sat the waiting for @CAPS to move again @CAPS finally did. I flashed @CAPS with the flash light @PERSON started laughing. As soon as @PERSON get their feet under them they want to hit me because they don't know what is in the tree or what I was laughing at. As they approach me, I turn back to @PERSON @PERSON ask her ""@CAPS @PERSON, do you want to see your monster?"" @CAPS freaked out again asking what is was. I told her, ""take a look at @CAPS for yourself"" @CAPS looked up @PERSON saw @CAPS.... A large brown paper bag that got swept up by the wind. As soon as I see that @CAPS say @CAPS I told @PERSON what @CAPS was @PERSON her @PERSON I started cracking up laughing about @PERSON @PERSON her ""hideous monster"". Once I got my laughs out on @PERSON, we all went back to the car where @PERSON was waiting @PERSON we left. Ever since that night @PERSON, @PERSON @PERSON I will never forget that night in the woods.

12383,20882,8," For me laughter makes the world go round. It is much needed to keep the world light and filled with a seance of happiness. You will hardly come across me with out a big old smile plastered across my face. There is so many stores to choose from but @TIME one will be the most fun to tell i think. It still makes me giggle just thinking about that @TIME. I was going on a trip with my last boyfriend, @PERSON, down to @LOCATION for the forth of @DATE. They have a big forth of @DATE walk and i was lucky to get to tag along with him and his mom. We wear staying with good friends of his mom @CAPS and @CAPS. There house was stunningly amazing, beaut full wood floors, big open living room that combined with the kitchen and dining room, vaulted ceilings, and a big stunning window that framed crisp @CAPS. @CAPS. Even with the house being so great my favorite part wear the rail rode tracks. Not more than a quarter of a mile through a little trail surrounded with woods wear two sets of tracks stretching out in both directions @CAPS far @CAPS the eye could see. My favorite part of the hole trip wear those tracks. It was the second @TIME of our stay in @LOCATION around @NUM o clock. @PERSON and i when for a walk in the refreshing @TIME. We could hardly see and wear holding on tight to each other to try and keep balance. Smiling and giggling we finally stumbled out of the very well hidden trail entrance on to the tracks. Hand in hand we started to walk down the tracks just enjoying each others presents. In @CAPS the stars are the most stunning i have ever seen. I'm not sure why but the sky just seems to open up and look two times bigger than it relay is. @TIME @TIME was perfect for star gazing with out a cloud in sight. So we decided to lay down between the tracks and look at the stars. There we cuddled together for a good @NUM minuets. Then @PERSON looked up. I gave him a puzzled expression then i followed his gaze to see what had aroused him. Far in the distance was a light. Slowly advancing t words use. Sure-a-nuff it was a train at @NUM o clock at @TIME. Looking back at each other we both laughed at the pure surprise of a train at @TIME. @CAPS the train advanced we jumped up and off the tracks to wait for it to pass so we could resume our spot.  The train was going way slower than i was expecting. No more than @NUM to @NUM mile per hour. @PERSON's eyes lit up with an idea and not thinking he said ""We should jump it!""  @CAPS soon @CAPS the words left his mouth he regretted saying them. I thought it was a great idea! But he tried desperately to convince me not to do it. I headed twords the track telling him to live a little and lets have some fun. I had never jumped a train before but from the looks of it @TIME train was perfect to try it out on. There wear long flat bead cars with handy little latters on each one. I garbed for one and jumped on right before @PERSON could stop me. He finally gave in and jumped on the next one. We wear both smiling and having a great @TIME when we jumped off and met in a hug. Then the train stopped. We froze. Then a light started coming our way. Freaking out, for sure thinking we would get in trouble i sprinted for the trail head with @PERSON close on my heals. I could not find the trail and the light was getting closer so we both jumped full speed straight in to a big bunch of bushes. There we stayed perfectly still tell the light passed us and the train began to rezoom its pace. I met @PERSON's big fat smile and we both just rolled over laughing not being able to help ourselves. What wear the chances of going out for a simple walk and all @TIME happening. Still smiling hugely @PERSON leans over to me and gave me a perfect kiss. That was one of my best nights ever. @TIME is just an example of how smiling and laughter was a big part of @PERSON's and I in our relationship.

They will be there for you to look back on and just smile on those days. Not being able to laugh would make this world dull and a very depressing place. Laughter is the main connection between family and friends.  My family and I decided that for our @DATE break we would drive to the great land of @LOCATION. Not one of us @CAPS how to get there, but my mom told us she would figure it out and for us not to worry about it. So the day we were released from school my mom packed us up and off we went.After two long hours of driving we finally arrived at the @CAPS @CAPS. The crowd to get across was huge. On the boat to get across, I thought about going up stairs to see where we were at. There it was @LOCATION.  Once we got off the boat and through the crowed highways of @LOCATION, and started to make our way across the @LOCATION/@CAPS border. I noticed that my mother had a weird look on her face, the look of worry. My sister asked her if she @CAPS what she was doing, she replied ""kinda"". After hours and hours of driving my mother thought it would be a good idea to just buy a map. When we looked at the map we noticed a little town that was very close. When we arrived my mom said we will stay here for the night. When we all woke up my mother told us that she remembered that the town we were staying in is the town we were suppose to be in. After driving around the town looking for our hotel, we were all in the room resting from driving around. My sister made a comment to my mom, about how funny it was to watch her drive around and act like she @CAPS what she was doing. This made all of us laugh. We all started to make random comments on her great navigation skills. The rest of the trip we drove around laughing and telling my mom, don't get lost this time, and ask for directions if you need them. laughing about us getting lost made the trip a truly unforgettable moment.   Being able to laugh, is the greatest feeling in the world. To do it with family is a great way to remember fun times. Not laughing could make this life horrible and dull.

12385,20884,8," Laughter brings the world together in a way that cannot be put into words. When two people laugh together over the same thing, a special bond is made that is like no other. There is no way to describe the connection and how it can build a relationship. Every person on this @LOCATION will hopefully experience the bond that laughter brings. Last @DATE, I was a member of a select lacrosse team and I didn't know any of the girls there. The team had five practices before the tournament and by the third practice, I still hadn't talked to many girls there. I was too shy to talk to these girls who all seemed to have a friend with them on the team. At the fourth practice, we were all stretching in a circle and I made a comment to one of the girls and she laughed. We began talking and throughout the rest of that practice, we talked and became friends. By making her laugh I had made a friend on the team and was even more excited for the upcoming tournament. The final practice was cut short so that the team could create tie-dye t-shirts to wear at the tournament. I sat down with @PERSON, the girl I had become friends with at the previous practice, and her friend @PERSON came over to sit with us on the concrete. We all began talking and laughing with each other. Our shirts were tied with rubber bands and we were ready to put the dye onto them. We were laughing and making a mess of the multiple colors, having a good time and enjoying the warm night. As we finished our shirts and put the sopping wet clothing into plastic bags, we walked to the parking lot and said our goodbyes. I now had two friends on the team and could not wait to leave for the tournament that @DATE. On a @DATE @TIME, I woke up at @NUM am to meet the team at a park in @LOCATION, OR. We were all meeting there to load our things into the three large white vans and to drive up as a team. I crawled into the van wearing my tie-dye t-shirt to see some of the girls looking tired and also sporting the tie-dyed shirts. @PERSON and @PERSON were in the back with another girl in between them so I sat in the row ahead of them. Some more girls from the team crammed into the van and we were on our way. During the @NUM @NUM hour car ride we slept, laughed and told stories. After being stuck in the car together for so long, we all bonded with each other over laughter and story telling. We each came from different cities, schools and backgrounds which made for a very entertaining car ride.  At the tournament, @PERSON, @PERSON and I all stuck together. We walked around the fields, ate meals and laughed together almost the whole time. The only time we were apart was when roomates were assigned and we were not put in a room together. We all worked together as a team towards a common goal, winning games and making it to the championship. All of the girls on that team bonded in some way and even now, most of us are still in contact with each other.  Laughter is what brought @PERSON and me together and the rest of the team followed. The entire team bonded over laughter and we all became more comfortable with each other through laughing and having a good time. Putting @NUM girls together from entirely different cities could have been a major disaster, but we connected with each other by making other laugh, making it a positive experience for all involved. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. Connecting with another human through laughter is an experience that everyone should have, it is so unique and powerful that friendships built on laughter can last a lifetime.

12386,20885,8,"   Humor is a huge part of who i am,and i love making people laugh, but this story is about an event that made my whole family fall down laughing on the floor. It all started one @DATE when my cousin received a trampoline for his birthday. It was a great day not only for him but for the rest of us kids too because we all could go and play on it whenever we wanted. We were always over at my cousins house after that. We would have competitions to see who could jump the highest or who could do the coolest trick. Sometimes we would fall off or one of us would get hurt and then my aunt and uncle wouldn't let us play on it for a while but they would always cave and let us back on it. It wasn't until a few months later that we all witnessed the funniest accident that any of us had ever seen in our life time. It all started out at my aunts birthday party. Usually she had it at some fancy restaurant but not this year, this year she decided just to have it at home to save some money. So we all show up for my aunts party my mom, my brothers, and me. First off we do all the regular birthday things, the meeting of family members, eating some food, and singing happy birthday. Basically in my eyes it was all the boring stuff. I mean come on there was a trampoline out in the back yard just waiting to be jumped on but the adults wouldn't let us get anywhere near it until we had ate. Finally everyone was done eating and they were going to let us kids go have our fun. It started off as normal as any other day we went to play on the trampoline but little did we know that all of our stomachs would be hurting from laughing in a few hours from an even that was about to transpire",15,19,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12387,20887,8,"It was a normal day, I had just woken up, because my friend @PERSON who had called me wondering if I wanted to hangout.I said yes and I went and took a shower and got ready. Once I was ready I called him back and asked him where he wanted to hangout at. He told me that he wanted me to go over to kyle house and play basketball.When I got there everyone was over there so we decied to have a big game of basketball.I was on the better team and already knew we were going to win, but every single shot I took I missed and it was really embarresing, but my team ended up winning which was no suprise.After the game we all were tired and went inside to play video games. We played @CAPS of @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS @NUM, we took turns and on my turns I did really bad because I dont really play video games so everyone laughed at me including myself.As soon as we were done playing I got a @CAPS from a bunch of girls who were going to the movies that night, and wanted to know if everyone and I wanted to go.Everyone decied to go, and we all wanted to see the movie paranormal activity @NUM, so we were pretty excited and before the movie started we all went over to @PERSON house and hungout with all the girls.We all sat in the living room listening to music while most of the girls were up stairs getting ready.I was bored so I went up stairs to hangout with the girls and let me tell you it was a bad idea because the second I walked up there they all wanted me to let them straighten my hair or let them put makeup on me.So I went back down stairs and warned everyone not to go up there.They asked why and when I told them they all laughed and some of them went up there anyway and came back with makeup on I laughed so hard that i fell off the couch.Once I finaly stopped laughing it was time to go and her mom drove us there but there was not enough seats in the car so me and all the girls we cramed into the front seat and the reast of the guys were in the back seat, so I was pretty happy.When we got in the movie theater there was a pretty long line but it was worth it.Suprisingly the moive was acutaly kinda scary it made me jump like five times.When we drove home it was like @NUM and @PERSON and I walked home from her house and the whole way back he was freaking out and it made me laugh and it made him laugh how I was kinda freaked out too.I think that it was a really fun day because I was laughing through most of it.",15,17,0.0,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.0
12388,20888,8," @CAPS is my personal belief that that hilarity and giddiness are the best emotional states to be in. Therefore @CAPS makes sense that people who find laughter in the same things would be of good relations. @CAPS is because of their likeness of minds that they are connected and find happiness in each others company. My story is an example of laughter's connection between people and the strength of the bond @CAPS forms. Picture the scene: @CAPS was @DATE on the north side of @CAPS. Hood below the infamous snow dome. Standing there was a weak eleven year old boy who thought he could not continue further. Patiently standing beside him was his father, a climbing veteran who had scaled mountains in @LOCATION,and @LOCATION. The boy was tired, he could not put one foot in front of the other. His muscles screamed in protest as the blisters on his heels throbbed in harmony. The @DATE sun beat down on him while the snow gave way and brought him to the ground. @CAPS was as if the mountain wanted him to fail and was urging him to give in and cry in defeat. Fatigue then consumed the boy adding fifty pounds to each of his limbs. His brain had dimmed as well leaving him capable of only simple thoughts like putting on foot in front of the other. He began finding any excuse to stop and made them often. The boy's father had tried everything he could think of to give his son the incentive to keep going with no avail. He tried another tack, he began to tell the boy stories, perhaps in hope that @CAPS would take the boy's mind of the excruciating pain.And to the relief of all concerned, @CAPS proved effective. What was most interesting about the whole event is @CAPS wasn't the content of the stories that helped, @CAPS was the humorous and sarcastic tone that made the real difference.An infusion that I would describe as a solution of laughing gas and an energy drink washed over me. In the presence of my father's humor I found the strength to keep going . @CAPS was like I had been completely recharged and refreshed. My arms and leg which had previously felt like solid pipes of lead lightened considerably. The stabbing agony in my muscles and joints frayed away and left. The dull pulsing of the blisters on my heels were silenced. This was all due to someones thoughts and ideas tickling my funny bone. I believe laughter to be the anesthetic of nature,the emotional element that keeps the world sane. @CAPS was at that point in time when I realized what I respected most about my father. I had no shortage of traits to choose from. He had a indomitable work ethic, was a great teacher, and possessed an extraordinary amount of energy. But what I respected most about him was that we were similar in our humor. We laughed at the same things and found hilarity at each others comment's. @CAPS forged a strong bond between us, one constructed of euphoria and glee that continues to this day. Whenever I am morose he always manages to find away to bring a smile to my face and I found that I to had the same ability. To my belief a relationship formed on laughter is the strongest one of all. Laughter is a force that paves the way to friendship,respect,and love. You cannot have hope for a better future if you do not have laughter. @CAPS is the drug that descends from the heavens. A drug that runs through the bloodstream of society. In the process freeing the minds from the stress and worries of what tomorrow will bring. Laughter can unite a population and instill a feeling of friendship in a society. Have you ever laughed at something and then turned to find that at the exact same moment someone across the room had also began to laugh. Then your eyes lock and a slow smile spread's throughout both of your faces, as you realize that you are not alone in how you think and what you laugh at. That connective force is a result of the power of laughter.",19,25,50.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0

Everyone has a past with laughing that has welcomed them, helped them out, cheered them up, or even, just so they can make a very special friend that will stay with them forever. It was the start of a brand new @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION @CAPS I had just moved from @LOCATION. I was a seventh grader about to start at @ORGANIZATION in @LOCATION, @CAPS wasn't a real big fan of hanging out with people , so i stayed to myself most of the weeks, eating lunch in the guidance center, trying to figure out where books where without talking to anybody. My schedule was good, I had choir, art, drama, you know all the stuff I like. Art @CAPS drama were a blast, but when it came to choir @CAPS singing, my social level went down. I love to sing, but never did it in front of people. Then one day, I was walking to choir @CAPS I tripped @CAPS fell, my papers falling with me. My @ORGANIZATION work was all over the hall, math at one end, science at the other. But, out of all the kids in the hallway, only one laughed. She walked by @CAPS say I did a great job but something triggered her to come back. She helped me pick up all my math homework @CAPS picked up my schedule @CAPS saw that she too had choir this period. Her name was @PERSON, she told me, @CAPS i told her my name, @CAPS we walked together. We sat next to each other @CAPS i sang with her ours voices in harmony. We talked in between periods, at lunch, on the bus ride home. We became great friends @CAPS the principal thought so too @CAPS he went ahead @CAPS gave us classes together. We were friends @CAPS we still are friends till this day. But the sad thing is is that she moved at the near end of eighth grade year. But she was the only friend I had for a little while @CAPS I always give her a call every now @CAPS then. Sometimes we can talk for hours, laughing @CAPS talking about how we are doing @CAPS when we are going to see each other again. She has been my best friend for at least two years now @CAPS it all happened by a slip of a foot, that falling of papers, @CAPS one little laugh from an amazing person. Laughing has got me so far in life @CAPS at @ORGANIZATION. Every now @CAPS then, when i see someone, all alone, wanting a friend, I go @CAPS talk to them, @CAPS even laugh with them.

Laughter can be the ending result, to a bad start to a day or to greater the relationship between two people. I love to laugh because it shows how I am feeling and it keeps me happy, I not only laugh when I'm sad, but also when I'm in a great mood as well. Growing up in a world full of tragedies and war, I feel like you should always keep your head held high and the smiles flowing. Although, when life gives you lemons, you must make lemonade and keep your face with the sour look because it's funny! I think that laughter is one of the best medicines around and can fix most problems whenever you are feeling down.  @CAPS older sister brought into this world the most amazing little nieces, an aunt could ever have. When @CAPS were little babies I used make silly faces, dance to @PERSON and watch movies with them, but this isn't what brought us closer. It was the fact that I wanted to laugh, in which made them happy too. One time, I was feeling really down and out, but I didn't want that to affect me, so I preceeded with @CAPS day and began to watch music videos, when ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS"", by @ORGANIZATION came on. @CAPS went crazy!, @CAPS started jumping on the bed and twirling their @CAPS back and forth as if @CAPS were @ORGANIZATION!, @CAPS really stole the show. I couldn't believe before @CAPS eyes that this one happening, and I bursted out with so much joy. I felt so much of their joy, that I had to get up and dance with them, we jumped, we twirled, and whipped our @CAPS several times before the song ended with us dizzy and out of breath. After we had our fun of the music video, @CAPS just kept dancing and in @CAPS head I'm, like ""don't @CAPS ever get tired"", but I was pretty sure that their laughter brought them continouis amazement. A smile is worth a thousand words and laughter is priceless, @CAPS nieces really and are truly what brought me up that day. It was bitter in the start but then ended up sweet, lets just called it bittersweet. I feel like @CAPS nieces knew that I would be sad so @CAPS would say ""@CAPS, what's wrong"", @CAPS being @CAPS nickname because I am very short. @CAPS would always find a way to make me feel the need to smile and have a good time. Me and @CAPS neices relationship has grown to the highest extent and I know that whenever I'm with them, I will laugh. If someone once said that ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", then @CAPS are correct because I @MONTH be in a different country, state or any other area but whether we talk on the phone or actually see each other, I will laugh about all their crazy antics and the closer we become as one.

12391,20893,8," Having laughter in your life is a big part in showing who you really are. Some people think that you @MONTH be one person who can be ""stuck up"" or a funny person who can really be ""stuck up"", but in the end your all laughing together no matter who they are. When you see something happen real funny you can't help but laugh. Or even when you get nervous all people do is laugh it off. All different kinds of people have different ways in showing how they can use laughter in their own lives. ""@CAPS are blue, roses are red, your always in my head, i want you in my bed...."" That's suppose to be a love poem. When your in a relationship with someone you might think your in love. If your partner is never open about anything, you probably don't have a great relationship. See if you can argue one moment with your lover then the next laugh it off because you were silly to be even discussing it. Your relationship involves love and laughter. Friendship is another great relationship for laughter. For example my friend and I were invited to a birthday party, she had lots of fun games and lots of food. My friend that went with me to the party her name is @PERSON. It was gettting late, and we were tired. We were not doing anything this was probably around @NUM in the @TIME. See us for some reason do love to sleep, but we were just having such a great time at our friends house we just didn't want the night to end at all.  We al sat and layed there on the ground and bed for about four hour earlier watching ""@CAPS A"". Then out of random i started to laugh at @LOCATION, and till this day I don't know why i was laughing at her. All of the sudden she started to laugh a lot harder at me, then I was starting to laugh harder just because she was laughing. I was almost to the point where I couldn't breathe no more. So I got up walk my self to the bathroom, but i could still hear @CAPS laughter in the room which was still making me laugh.  Since that night @PERSON and I got a lot closer in our friendship.

12392,20894,8," As we all know, water is what we most need to stay alive cause without it we'd pretty much die. Well, it's also quit similar with laughter. I once heard my night school teacher say, ""@CAPS is @PERCENT attitude"". I thought about it for r a moment and realized it's quit true. No one can really go throughout the hole day, without having any type of beverage and as much as someone is upset for any apparel reason, will soon end up smiling. Who knows perhaps for the silliest thing whatsoever. I've been going out with my boyfriend @LOCATION, for about seven months already. We don't get to see each other as much as I'd like to. We try to spend the weekends together as much as we can, but there's been times when it's every other weekend. Since him and I have quit a few things in common like, our relatives, knowing each other before dating, places we go for entertainment, food, likes and dislikes. We rarely dislike of where we'll be spending our time togethe or what we're doing. Even though its been about seven months since we've been dating, it feels like we've known each other way before we became friends. Once when I was over at @LOCATION's house celebrating @PERSON's birthday, @ORGANIZATION's youngest sister. We, all who where there, were celebrating her birthday with pinatas, cake, and all she wanted, witch where toys too. We where all having a good time but the kids weren't so much, it seemed as if they were running out of energy since they were playing in the trampoline for quit a couple of hours. Before the kids could even mention anything about the pinatas, we had already gotten most of what was need to set up the pinatas. As they heard the candy being pored into the pinatas they all rush to get there first before the others, could get to hit the pinata. @PERSON go to hit the pinata before all the others, since it was her birthday, then the little kids followed her to hit the pinata. As they went up to hit the pinata we sang songs, it wasn't the best but we all tried. We even made jokes, of pretending to imagine who the pinata was representing. As time passed, it was turn for the older kids to go up and hit the pinata. Most of us were kind of shy, but before I notice a @NUM year-old went up to hit the pinata. Right after she hit the pinata quit hard the others said her time was up, they were anctious to get the candy out. After her turm was over she was supose to call out on someone. I thought she would end up calling me since she keept looking towards me. I was already blushing, good thing she didnt. she ended up calling out on my boyfriend. He of course got up and grabed the stick to hit the pinata. Once he got there, the others where said to not hit it so hard or else the little ones whouldn't like him anymore. Since he is one of thoes persons who's love @CAPS everyone. He cheard me up to go with him. Without him saying that ii don't think I would of done it. Right there were we where, teaching me how to swing the stick to hit the pinata, I swung it to hard that I ended up hitting him. Before @CAPS even say anything, one of his aunts said. That's the way I'd be getting when ever I'd get bothered at him. @CAPS starting out slow then hitting him right where it hurt the most. I was even reder then when I was blising, all I thought of saying was that it might be true when ever it happend @CAPS then @PERSON' mom was already getting the cake out, I just left fron where I was at to go help her out. Once we all got settled to sing happy birth-day to @LOCATION, we where stil laughing of what had happen. Thing is they where stil talking about it. How it might be the same when we get merried. Again I didnt know what to say so I just simle. Everyone was leaving and right before I could call my dad he was already outside the door. All I said was thank you daddy,with a silly smile.",18,18,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0

When having so much fun by taking many pictures and videos we lost track of time. I can't even remember which one of us was laughing the hardest. @CAPS is just one example of the crazy things my friend @PERSON and I have done together. One thing is for certain, whenever we are together we are always laughing. Laughter reduces stress for both @PERSON and I. We were team members for the past six years. Both of us competed as gymnasts at @ORGANIZATION. We worked out at the gym @DATE for four hours each day. That gave us no time to hang out with friends and just enough time to do homework. At @ORGANIZATION, @PERSON and I needed to be focused so we wouldn't get hurt. @CAPS meant off the floor we needed laughter to reduce stress, as well as fear. In order to do that we would hang out a lot on the weekends and in the @DATE sun.  Our friendship was strong because of all the laughing and fun times together. When either of us became stressed we would make the other cheer up by remembering the times when we laughed our heads off. Even when we are not together we often think of the memories we have shared together. As mentioned earlier laughter also helps to reduce fear. It helps because if you were not having fun and laughing you would think about all of the bad things at could happen to you; then would you do have laughter involved it makes you want to do whatever it would be with your friend.  The laughter @PERSON and I shared always attached others to us. Whenever we were together others always wanted to join is because we were having such a great time together. For example, @DATE we were at @LOCATION's house and we were playing outside on a warm, sunny day. We were laughing and all of a sudden one of her neighbors shows up. After one came, more and more kids and her friends came, after awhile it seemed like we had the whole neighborhood there with us. When we had a big group of people, @PERSON and I would choose a different game that would be better for a lot of people. It usually was a hide and go seek tagging game. Even though it wasn't just the two of us we were always laughing because we would trick everyone that was playing. It created a good and positive bond for the two of us even though there were more people. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS is how @PERSON and I became such amazing friends today. Without laughter, I do not think we would have been as close of friends if we didn't have laughter in our friendship. Our laughter brings us closer together every single time we see each other. Laughter really connects the bond between friends and its helps both of you get through hard times.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

I also agree with those thoughts.  I came to @LOCATION about @DATE, I did not speak @CAPS at all that time. I started going school. I practiced saying my name, age, and where I came from before I go to school. Next day I walked in to school and I could see that everyone was looking at me. It was pretty scary to me. I looked back at one girl and she walked towards me.  ""@CAPS, my name is @PERSON,"" the girl said. ""@CAPS, my name is @CAPS. I'm from @LOCATION. I don't really speak @CAPS,"" I said to @PERSON, then @PERSON started laughing so hard. ""@CAPS-@CAPS you have accent,"" @PERSON said, ""it's really cute."" I laughed back. @PERSON looked really nice with her smiles on and we became friends so quickly. She was my first @CAPS friend ever.

12395,20897,8," Laughter is the best way to show someone that they are funny. It is the best way to relax. Everyone says that hearing a baby laugh is great. Watching comedians doing their acts can cheer people up and have them start laughing. Laughter is the best way to relax and here is three reason for that. First, is that no one can stay angry at the person making them laugh. Second, is that when someone laughs everyone around that person start laughing. Third and last reason, is that no one can stay sadden when something funny is happening. What do you think when you hear a baby's laughter? I think that the baby is truly loved by its family. He or she is having a bast playing with someone in the family or themselves. They think that whatever you are doing is funny. A comedian's job is to make a crowd of people laugh at or with them. One way a comedian does an act is stand up comedy. That is when a comedian is on stage and does his or her act. Another way is a comedy. A comedy can be a @CAPS.V. show, a play, or a movie. Comedies usually do not have a plot, but the point is to make you and anyone else start laughing. That is what I think about laughter. It helps anyone relax. Hearing a baby's laugh is great.

12396,20898,8," @CAPS only happened a few weeks ago on a day the all the students were supposed to be out having fun or sleeping because there was plenty of snow outside. A guy was crying on his chair with his hands over his eyes, a french horn in his lap and his gaze fixed on the ground below him. Sobs choked the sound in the band room but luckily for this guy's pride there weren't too many people in the room to start off with. The guy's head rose up, the tears seemed to eat the self sturdiness of his normal self, and @CAPS spoke to the person who always sat to his left. "" @CAPS just don't understand @PERSON"" the broken, voice cracked on words ""I don't care that @CAPS play in cascade winds or that @CAPS get private lessons or that @CAPS've gone to state honor band! This @MONTH sound like a terrible reason, but i just want to play first because i want to play first, and @CAPS never let us play first."" @CAPS was right about one thing, @PERSON really never let us play first. I somehow understood where @CAPS was coming from; @CAPS my freshman year i had always sat under him, and him under someone else and so forth. I had never seen him be first chair on anything. And now on his senior year, a prodigy child had come into band and she only knew how to fight for her position as first chair. In short @CAPS's four hard years of working for the first chair spot in band were summed up to being second best the moment she stepped in the room. The feeling of all his hard work turned into mediocre in his face, with time, had broken him to tears.  @PERSON was much better than us and she has the accolades to prove @CAPS. She had attended cascade winds solo ensemble festival, band camp, and would be going to @LOCATION as an ambassador of music. Still something about her having first part still didn't feel quite right. Maybe @CAPS was my sense of wanting superiority as well. @PERSON took in the words, leaned closer to say. "" I understand that @CAPS want first"" @CAPS with confident tones she said ""but right now we need specific players in specific spots. I've played harder music and my skills are whats needed on first part. I understand what your feeling, ive been there before.""  @CAPS struck me weird that a sophomore was telling this to a senior. How could she have felt what @CAPS was feeling? she'd been a prodigy child in @CAPS @CAPS from the start. I sided with @PERSON but @CAPS I realized that letting him play a more demanding part would be worse for the band. So i tried siding with @PERSON but @CAPS all i could think about was that this was @PERSON's last year to shine as a @CAPS @CAPS french horn player.They kept going at eachother. Every comment scraping at the already fragile surface of the argument. Minutes made the quarrel more and more volatile.  I had to think faster. @CAPS the argument continued like this the horn section would be torn apart and co-operation would be useless. More importantly I would lose two partners that together had uprooted a great deal of musical talent. I slid my chair next to them to tell them my thoughts. ""@CAPS a man has no socks,"" I liked starting out my thoughtful speeches with mysterious beginnings, "" @CAPS so will..."".And that's as far as i got. I thought @CAPS was brilliant, their faces said otherwise. So they called me crazy and giggled @CAPS they made fun of me and laughed. Thankfully i was oblivious of the stuff they called me because i really wanted to remember what i wanted to say. @CAPS stopped crying, finally, and @PERSON got my message that @CAPS was a senior and didn't really have many more chances at playing first chair in @CAPS @CAPS band. They settled the fight with a simple deal; @CAPS would get fist chair as soon as we stopped competing. @CAPS @CAPS I've been the center of being made fun of. But as annoying as @CAPS gets sometimes its usually funny for everyone, including myself.  I cant even begin to imagine what band would be like @CAPS their enmity had risen to the no forgiveness zone. There had been times before when heated discussions left the stress levels in our section so @CAPS @CAPS made @CAPS hard to breath right. Having laughter come in even right before they were about to rip eachother's faces off gave them time to understand that they had mutual understanding of each other. Or opened their eyes to how long they're going to have to sit next to each other i they were to continue fighing. Either way, @CAPS's definatley changed the way they feel about eachother; I haven't heard them complian about one another for a while. @CAPS is eagerly awaiting his turn to shine and @PERSON for better or worse can't wait to see him play.",23,21,0.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.0,44.0
12397,20899,8,"We're happy together @PERSON told me @CAPS we lay on his bed. I just smiled and I knew this was going to be a really good relationship. @CAPS always made me feel so great. @CAPS made me feel beautiful. Now don't say your too young to know what love is ,@CAPS I've heard it from my mom every time I talked about him. But I know that no one has ever made me feel this wonderful about myself, made me feel perfect. When we are together it's fun. Most guys I have been with have not been @CAPS fun, @CAPS in our dates together, walking to the park too sit and talk, eating out to kiss in public. Before we were ever dating, We were best friends. We still are best friends. Everyone asked us @CAPS we were dating, The answer was always no we're best friend's, but I always wanted more. @CAPS has always made me laugh. I don't think we would have made such a strong couple @CAPS we didn't make each other laugh. Just thinking about @CAPS I first knew I loved him makes me laugh. I was walking to my @DATE class, and out of no where @PERSON grabs my arm and pulls me into a huge bear hug, and buried his head in my neck and laughed and said ""@CAPS, you have some toilet paper sticking out of your pants"" I felt my face turn twenty different shades of red. I smiled and quietly asked him to hide me so I could grab it. When I got to my @DATE class I was thinking to myself @CAPS could @CAPS just say that to me, @CAPS must of wanted to embarrass me. But the more I thought about what @CAPS did and @CAPS @CAPS did it made me feel, well it made me feel like @CAPS really and truly cared about me. Wanting to help me out rather then embarrass me. I bet every other guy was laughing. Not @PERSON... well after that happened we had a good laugh. After we laughed and joked about what happened to me, @CAPS looked up and kissed me. I didn't know @CAPS that was a best friend kiss, or a real love kiss. So I simply laughed. then @CAPS kissed me again. This time I knew it was a real love kiss. We weren't like most couples either. Which made us stand out, and the more we stood out the more people started to hate the fact that we were together. They would say some horrible things to me in the hallway about @PERSON. Who knows what they were telling him. @CAPS some of my closest friends started to make rude comments toward me and @PERSON. I know @CAPS didn't believe anything they were saying @CAPS @CAPS would laugh at everything people would toss our way. When @CAPS laughed I would always ask him whats so funny, @CAPS would say ""@CAPS they rumors aren't true then laugh about them, that way people will know your not bother by them"" I would have never thought about that. I'm the kind of girl who wears her emotions on her sleeve, so of course I would get a little peeved with all the stuff they were saying about us. After I started laughing at all the rude and nasty things people were saying,. They stopped talking about us, it was like magic. I never thought about being in @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION let alone @ORGANIZATION, and finding a guy that would understand what I'm going through. Let alone someone who is going through something almost @CAPS difficult. My brother went to prison @DATE, and I don't think I could have be able to make it through @CAPS much @CAPS I did with @PERSON. I cried almost everyday at @ORGANIZATION with him. It's been about a year now. Every time I go see my brother I remember what @PERSON said, ""@CAPS your happy the people around will be happy"" so I always put on a smile to see @LOCATION, @CAPS though I know this will be the hardest years of my life. Laughing does really help. @CAPS @CAPS nothing is funny just laugh. God put you on this @LOCATION for a reason, and @CAPS you haven't found that reason laugh until you do. @CAPS the people in your life mean the world to you, and @CAPS they're down bring them up.

12398,20900,8," Everyone loves to laugh; I don't think everyone understands the effect laughter can have on two people though. For example, there can be two complete strangers, who have never seen each other before in their life; as soon as they start laughing they could become good friends. You'll never know how close you can be with someone if you don't ever sit down and talk, laugh, and get to know them. You could go your whole life being at @CAPS with just a minute amount of friends but then there could be @NUM other classmates you've never talked to that could also become your friends, too. I'm sure just getting to know one another would make a difference in someones life because for me there has been many situations where laughing has made an impact on my relationship with someone; especially with my best friend, @PERSON. When I first met my friend @PERSON we didn't know each other at all but laughing broke the ice. A simple laugh made us comfortable and everything was less awkward. As soon as we started laughing more and more, we couldn't stop; the rest was history. I went to elementary @CAPS with @PERSON for @NUM years and never talked to her but then when we got into @NUM grade we started hanging out with the same people and started talking more. By @NUM grade we began to hang out outside of @CAPS and talking, sharing secrets, and having sleep overs. But ""breaking the ice"" isn't the only impact laughing can have on a relationship. When I'm with @PERSON, I know I can trust her and everything is fun. We always have conversations to talk and laugh about. You could say it made us closer. By the time @NUM grade came we were best friends, we had sleepovers every single weekend at one anothers house. When the @DATE before our @NUM grade year at the @CAPS @CAPS came we were spending weeks at each others houses. There wasn't a day that went by that we weren't together, talking, or making plans over the @DATE to hang out. Now, we can be ourselves around each other; we can always have a good time. Making people closer is just a small part of the effects that just one laugh can do to two people. When I'm sad about something @PERSON makes everything better; also vise versa; I make her feel better, too. We always have each others back. I know we will always be there for each other; I'll always have a shoulder to cry on. We have become such close friends that when @PERSON was having problems at home she needed a place to live in order for her to not have to go to The @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS, so she moved in with me! It has been the most fun living with her. We thought we would start to argue and not be as close since we would always be together and probably get annoyed of each other but we haven't. @PERSON and I can hang out @NUM and always be together; it's like having another sister.  @PERSON and I are super close, and she plans to stay living with me for the rest of @CAPS @CAPS until we graduate. It's amazing to think us being best friends and tremendously close, living together, always being together, and being totally comfortable with each other on everything just started out with a simple laugh when we first started talking in the @NUM grade. This is why I believe that just laughing can make two strangers, that have never even spoken, can turn into being the closest of friends.",22,20,0.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0
12399,20901,8," One @DATE @TIME back in @DATE a couple of friends and I were beyond bored. Nothing seemed fun to do. @CAPS to a movie, @CAPS to get some food, not even call of @CAPS sounded entertaining. @LOCATION parents told us to go do something outside. Before leaving his house he slips into his pantry and grabs two hefty rolls of @CAPS wrap. ""I think I have an idea"" @CAPS @PERSON as we walk away from his house. I have no clue where we're walking to. @PERSON just keeps saying ""follow me."" We all follow in a pack down the street until we show up at @ORGANIZATION.   Cold and confused, we sit in the parking lot of the @ORGANIZATION waiting for all cars to be gone. Once all the cars are gone @PERSON informs us on what we are doing here. He tells us of something he did with his cousins awhile back. You have three people on the roof of @ORGANIZATION's @ORGANIZATION scoping out the road and you have four @CAPS. ""@CAPS?"" I question @PERSON with a dumb-found look on my face. ""@CAPS, @CAPS"" @CAPS @CAPS are the people who will be putting the @CAPS wrap across the street. The plan is when no cars are coming in the distance, we hop the fence and put @CAPS wrap across the street so cars drive through it and stop. ""@CAPS sounds fun, but uh what happens when the @CAPS stops before the @CAPS wrap and takes it down?"" @CAPS @CAPS, looking down on the whole operation.  @PERSON laughs a little bit and @CAPS ""@CAPS then it will be an inconvenience for the driver."" @CAPS wrapping roadways sounded a lot for fun then black ops so we were all down.  Everyone gets in position. Mark, @PERSON, @PERSON and myself are down by the roadway in a secluded area by some bushes. While @PERSON, @CAPS and @PERSON are posted up on the roof giving us updates about the oncoming traffic. We get a call from @CAPS saying that it is clear for awhile. I hang up the phone, tell the guys and @DATE up from the ground. We all get over the fence in quick time and start a first layer of @CAPS wrap. I get another call. It's @CAPS saying that there are three cars are almost to our location. We drop the @CAPS wrap in the bush and get back over the fence. The @CAPS comes up close and it's a cop. Of course. We all just stay hidden down in the bushes while the cop takes our huge roll of wrap. We are only left with one more roll , which should before enough.  @CAPS calls again and @CAPS it's clear. We go out again and start to set up the prank. We wrap it around @NUM times and make it as tight as it possibly could be. Perfect.  ""@CAPS incoming! Go! Go! Go!"" yells mark while trying to get over the fence. We all make it over in time and go prone in the field. Laying there anxiously someone whispers ""here it comes.""  The @CAPS slams on it's breaks, and the driver gets out. He looks at @CAPS wrap in disgust and looks around for the kids responsible. @CAPS lets out a big ""hahaha"" from the roof that even we can hear perfectly. The guy walks up the fence looks around a bit more and mutters for foul words under his breath. He didn't even bother continuing through, he just got in his @CAPS and backed up.""@CAPS my god dude that was hilarious!"" I say with a wide grin on my @NUM @CAPS and @PERSON come dashing through the field with a scared expression on all of their faces.""@CAPS!"" yells @CAPS scurried into different directions. Mark, @PERSON and I jolt over the fence and hide in the play structure for awhile. While the rest of the boys are booking it to a safe haven. We eventually all meet back up at @LOCATION house without getting ""caught"" by the authorities.  It's nights like @CAPS were laughter really plays a key role between a big group of friends like I have. The laughing and running makes us closer as a group. it brings us together.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12400,20902,8," I agree when people say laughter is what mostly brings people together. In my opinion, @NUM of the time your talking to someone, laughter is needed. It is what brings the dullness out of a person, and makes the conversation interesting. Only when you are talking about something serious, you dont need to include laughter, but ill explain later. So I can easily tell a true story about laughter from my life. Right now i have a perfect group of friends. Sure there are times when they mess up and act like kids, but i feel like i need to forgive and remember that they are there when i need them. Anyways, i can remember the first time i met each one of them, and the one thing that started our friendship was a joke. I can't exactly remember which joke we shared, but i do remember that we all had the same taste in comedy. And once we saw that neither of us were serious and dull people, made us want to spend more time with eachother. That is why laughter builds a string between different people, and brings them closer together day by day. So as time passed, my friends and i were really drawn to eachother. What i mean is that, from time to time, we were happy to express our friendship through jokes. Sometimes the jokes are really stupid. Many of them have caused pain - physically, and have caused us to bring revenge on eachother. But that is just how, we stay close to eachother. Day by day, when we see something funny on the television, internet, or real life, we always show it to eachother, and know that after showing this prank, or whatever it is, the other person will find it very funny. It makes us feel closer, and know we all have a same taste in atleast one field. I can give one clear example of this: I was watching a comedy once, and the comedian was talking about his childhood, and a prank he once played on a strangers house. Right when i saw this video, i knew right away, my friends had to see this, because i knew from past experiences, that they enjoy these types of laughs. And i was right, as soon as they saw the show, they were amazed at how funny it was, and they were glad i shared it with them, we got closer than ever. I want to share one more example from my life, about laughter bringing two people closer. So after telling you that laughter gets me closer with friends, i also want to point out that laughter brings out a sence of outline when if you talk to girls - or boys, if you're a female. So i met this one girl, and everytime i talked to her, everytime i had to throw in a joke or a story that would make sence to our subject. After a while, she started joking around, and making stories too. She told me that she saw me as a different guy, comparing me to other people. She said that she meant i wasnt a boring type of person, and that it kept her wanting to keep talking to me. I always hoped not to be a dull person, and jokes made that not happen. Now, me and this girl are closer than ever, and the root that started this relationship was laughter. So as you see, laughter makes any relationship happy and open. Of course im talking about the relationships that are playful, i meant there are people out there that take everything serious, and can't take a joke. But i would really encourage you to take laughter in your life, if you already havent. Look in my life, i used laughter, and gained a lot of friends, of all sorts - just by joking around about something stupid. You don't have to say stupid things, but I say it would really make your life more interesting if you use laughter.",20,18,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12401,20904,8," These are some example that i remember when i had fun and laughter in my life  @CAPS all started in the @DATE time when i was like @NUM years old and my cousins were living with @CAPS cause they had just moved down to @LOCATION from @LOCATION. @CAPS was fun having them around. @CAPS and my cousin @PERSON and my cousin @PERSON who lived right next to @CAPS would always ride bike. Some times joey would take my bike with out asking @CAPS and i would get so mad at him.he would take my bike like if @CAPS was his. @CAPS and my cousins would always race down the street with our bikes.  I was always the one to win the race the kind of bike i has was a @PERSON @CAPS was a @CAPS bike witch is a bike made for the dirt and to race. @CAPS and my cousins would go behind some apartment down are street and there was a ramp that we made. @CAPS was just dirt but @CAPS was hard. One day when @CAPS was raining so hard @CAPS , @PERSON , @PERSON and another neighbor of our asked us to come out side to we asked our parents if we could and my parents said @CAPS was okay same with @PERSON. Joeys @CAPS said he could not cause @CAPS was raining hard outside but he still came outside. we had got all muddy i ad fell of my bike trying to go up the ramp while @CAPS was all muddy. then my cousin got like beat up from all the time he fell off the bike.  By the time we were done playing out side we were so muddy and our bikes were filled with dirt. my @CAPS was mad at @CAPS cause i was so muddy so she send @CAPS straight to the shower . @CAPS and my cousins had a good time that day after we were all done getting cleaned up we were playing super @PERSON bros for super @ORGANIZATION. If we were not playing the super @ORGANIZATION, riding bikes or getting wet with water gun and water balloons since @CAPS was so hot out side. We were probably on our way to the park for free lunch the school would always serve free lunch to who ever want free lunch. a lot of my friends would go to the park and get lunch same with my cousins after we would finish eating @CAPS my cousin @PERSON and my friend @PERSON would always trade @CAPS cards or @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS cards back then every body had @CAPS or @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS cards. i had piles of cards. @CAPS was fun being at the park with friend and family just having a fun time eating playing getting wet in park. When i was in @NUM grade @CAPS @PERSON @CAPS and @PERSON @CAPS were like the three amigos we would stay at @ORGANIZATION house like almost every weekend. we would always stay at @ORGANIZATION house because his back yard was big and we would always play hide-seek and cause @PERSON had like a play room with a pin ball machine a basketball hoop and other games. One time on @ORGANIZATION birthday @CAPS @PERSON and @CAPS slept over at @ORGANIZATION house and we were just playing video games like one of the games we played was grand theft auto @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS was a cool games.  I think that laughter is a big part in friendship cause if your having a good time hanging around with your friend and just laughing then that mean that hes a good person . If your friends always make you laugh then there good friends to be around with. Like i would always hang around with @PERSON, and @PERSON cause they would always know how to make @CAPS laugh .So thats why i think laughter is inportant to havewith friends or family.

12402,20905,8," Someone once said laughter was the best medicine. To me it was like someone was saying ""@CAPS! Life isn't gonna get any better so just enjoy it while you @CAPS!"" @CAPS that's what I did for a while, but laughing at everything got old very quickly. Sad to say I still laugh at most things, even sad things. I laugh because I think that if I do then everything will just get better. That's not even close to what really happens. In fact it @CAPS only cause more pain and suffering in most cases. Like the time where I met this guy named @PERSON. He was amazing. Most people who met him thought he was a god and when he heard people talking about him like that he would always get very upset. He was a human. Nothing more and nothing less. That's how I saw it and that's how he saw it too. When we first started talking to each other it was between notes I would give my friend @CAPS and @CAPS would give them to him. He was a very shy guy so he never wrote back on a piece of paper. Instead he had @CAPS tell me what he said. Then he finally got the idea to wright messages in her phone and then I would read them and answer back. it was fun for a while but I wanted to actually meet the guy. I had seen one of his rare pictures and it was true he was very handsome but nothing like a god. He didn't have a wreath over his head with one of those @CAPS god skirts. Nope, he was just an ordinary kid who dressed like a skater and was just a real inamorata. He had jet black hair (he dyed it), bright green eyes, and a smile that could shock the whole world.  Signs were going off in my head telling me to be careful but I never listened to them, they only made my life worse. So one day a few of my friends and I were in @LOCATION, @LOCATION with our teacher for a calligraphy convention when @PERSON (my friend) starts text messaging someone. I was a little curious so I asked in a friendly way who it was. @CAPS said it was @PERSON and my heart seemed to jump. ""@CAPS you tell him I say hello?"" ""@CAPS."" @CAPS told him I said hello and he asked if I was really there and @PERSON said yes. That's when we actually got to talk to each other more than once a day. We talked all the way back to @LOCATION. A few months went by and we were back to our old way of talking to each other. He was very kind and never did he have a bromidic moment. He told me about his family (which is a little strange, but I don't judge), his life, his future, what he felt and how he wished he could see me so he could give me a big hug (another of @CAPS's friends said the same thing but @CAPS said he wasn't aloud to). I talked to him about all of it and it was like we understood each other a little bit. I told him about my life but there really wasn't much to tell since my life has always been bromidic. I thought we could actually make things work between us, that is until he moved to @LOCATION. I was a little upset but it really didn't bother me except the fact that talking to each other became almost as rare as seeing a different picture of him.  While at school one morning @PERSON came over to me and had a careful gaze. I asked what was wrong and then @CAPS asked if anything could ruin my day. I told her that only going home would and we laughed a little about it. I knew something was wrong and that it had to do with @PERSON but I just acted oblivious to it hoping it would lessen the blow I knew was about to come. @CAPS said he had told her it wasn't going to work out between him and I. I sat there and like the idiot I was I said I knew it wasn't going to anyways, he was him and I was me. @CAPS said he was sorry and all these other excuses but I wouldn't listen. Instead I ignored it and went on with my life like I think everyone should. Of course a few months later he asked @PERSON out but I let it go just as @CAPS did when @CAPS said no to him and they stopped talking to each other. So who ever said laughter was the best medicine obviously hadn't experienced the after effects of it all. ",15,19,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12403,20906,8,"Trust is a huge deal between friends. Friends agree on the same things, say an honest opinion about it, and don't lose the trust between a great friendship. You never know who can stay by you with a full amount of trust between you two.When you trust a friend you depend on them to keep things between each other. Just like my friends and I. We agreed on telling each other everything that has happened and not to lie about anything. We agreed on everything based on trust. Our friendship has always been great with not lying to each other. Telling each other how we feel about certain things. Then we put all our opinions together and come up with a solution that we all agree on. That's why you should depend each other like a team. When you break a trust between a friend, you probably won't get the same trust you had before. You don't really get told anything as much as you use to. An it's like you never should have lost the trust with a friend. You don't seem to be the same because you aren't trusted that much. You get told it was your fault lying or for any reason to be not trusted. Like this one time one of friends didn't tell me the whole truth of what she was doing behind my back. Till I found out what she was doing I lost most of my trust with her. She's not trusted as much she was before, but we are still friends.That's why having trust is a big deal in a friendship or any kind of relationship. You learn to trust each other in different ways, get to know each other more by having the trust between you and other person. You get a lot more attention when you have that trust with other people. You don't seem like you are left out on anything. You see that you can trust more people to when you get to know them. Who knows that you have trust for another person who isn't your best friend.So we all know that trust is a huge deal between two people or maybe even more. You need to work together for the trust. Have a good friendship or relationship to anybody as long as there is trust between you guys. My friends and I have learned a lot from trusting each other in different ways.",24,20,0.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.0,44.0

I was with my friends @PERSON, @PERSON all three of us joined the snowboard team at school that year. The three of us caught a chair up to the top of the run. The air was so crisp, @PERSON the snow was a fresh blanket of powder. We were all so excited to go ride in that perfect of a @TIME. As we went down the run, it was the same old usual every @DATE @TIME. so I talked to my friends @PERSON suggested that it was time we went through some new trails. They agreed, so we went down through @TIME new area. It was a good trail with many jumps @PERSON a lot of powder. It seemed like a perfect area to board in. We all enjoyed it very much. But we realized that it was coming to the end when the trail was getting a little narrow, then suddenly, there was a drop right in front of us. I shifted my board sideways so I can stop, but it didn't help. It was a patch of ice that i hit, @PERSON it was no use. I couldn't stop. I fell off, @PERSON braced for impact. I was thinking that I was about to be seriously injured because of the rocks below. But luckily, my board was the first to hit the rock, showering the cool @TIME with sparks lighting it up. I slid down the snow a couple more feet, trying to stop myself. As I came to a stop, I looked back wondering how I survived that. I was worried that my friends would do the same, but they had stopped just in time. We all couldn't believe on what just happened.

12406,20909,8," Laughter, everyone from babies to old people do it. Laughter is an element that helps in life. They say that ""laughter is the best medicine"" it truly is. Laughing lets people know that you have a good sense of humor and that you like to have fun and let loose. In any friendship, relationship, job or sport you need to laugh every once in a while. You can't always be serious. Being serious @NUM as they say is not good, it makes people seem like they don't know how to enjoy life or they have no sense of humor.  In the @DATE I had a rough volleyball season. A lot of my teammates had problems with me, because I was chosen as captain along side my friend @PERSON. We weren't the most well liked, but we were liked by some. It was hard for @PERSON and I to prove that we were right for the position of captains and that we could lead the team. A few of my teammates at the time quit because they did not want to deal with @PERSON and I being captains, but as they quit we moved people from junior varsity up to varsity. The new varsity members had it rough, they struggled a bit trying to get the hang, but they did it they managed to get the hang of how varsity plays and practices. Soon after our mishap of having to replace seven out of fourteen players we had our first game. The game was one of the toughest we had the whole season. In our first set of the we didn't exactly have our minds in it for the first of what would be come a five set, game. We battled back and forth a few points in the first set, but we ended up losing that first set. We went into the second set not knowing what we were going to do whether to give up or half-@CAPS it was tough, I as one of the captains said ""@CAPS, we won't get anywhere unless we @CAPS."" then @PERSON says ""I agree, lets @CAPS our best and not let them get an easy win."" We did exactly that we tried and we won that second set. It was the third set and we had started to get tired and feel aggravated, so we pushed forward we won the third set. One more set and we would win it. We went on the court and the ball was served we let the ball hit the ground point one to the other team. After that first point it went down hill we let them get the best of us and they won the set. It had come down to the fifth and final set were we would either win or lose. We got on the court knowing that we might lose and started. The first point went to us we went back and forth a ton in the final set. It was a tough battle, but we had done it we won. Later in the season we met the team again and it was a hands down battle we had lost the second time we met them it was not easy at all they didn't allow any room for errors on their behalf, but us we let it all slip. It was time for the state playoffs we had made it to the state finals. The team we were playing was the team we had faced twice before and we were one and one. The line-up was called, national anthem sang, and the coin was flipped, we would receive the serve. The game was in full swing, we were doing great we won the first set by four a tough first game. We went into set two, we lost control. We didn't do what we were suppose to do. We lost the second set it was and confidence hitter. We were down we didn't know what to expect in set three, and as captains the team seeing @PERSON and I should have not let ourselves be down. We looked at each other with that look I knew and we just busted out laughing we couldn't stop the team wondered what was wrong. So we explained that in order to win we had to laugh we @MONTH feel down, but you have to laugh and the team did we went into the third set confident as ever and we won we didn't stop there we went into the fourth set and won. We had done what we set out to do win! In the end laughing was what we needed to do we had come this far that we could either give up or push and succeed. We looked at the two previous games that we had met the other team before and laughed. We made that our team motto ""laugh until you cry, and cry until you laugh"" the season was great looking back on it we were state champs.

The fight started over something so small and insignificant that neither of them could remember what it was. The fight had a snowball affect untill neither of them knew what they were fighting over. Then one day, while they were taking a break from fighting, we went to see a funny movie. A while into the movie I got up to go to the restroom, and when i got back my freind and his girlfreind were both lauphng histaricly. I asked them what was so funny, but they wouldn't tell me.  @CAPS the movie we went to a @CAPS restorant for dinner. While we were being seated my freind mumbled something i couldn't hear to his girlfreind, and she burst into laughter. I again asked what was so funny, and again they replied that it was nothing. During dinner, which was extrordiary for @CAPS food, my freinds girlfreind got up to go to the restroom. @CAPS she was out of earshot, my freind turned to me and said, ""@CAPS'll never beleive what just happened. Me and her aren't fighting any more. @CAPS @CAPS left to go to the restroom, I asked her if she could remember what we were fighting over, and she said she had no idea and was just fighting because she diddn't want to loose the arguement. @CAPS she said that I fessed up and said i was argueing for the same reason. this made us laugh so hard because we boh realized that the argument could have been over long befor that night."" @CAPS this I almost never heard of them fighting again. This was untill they got into another arguement when she moved out of state. The arguement was over the fact that he wanted to do a long distance relationship, but she didn't want to. Since laughter saved their relationship for a little while I strongly believe that Laughter is an important part of a relationship.

In @DATE, my family was living in @LOCATION, @ORGANIZATION. My mom and dad had @NUM baby girls, before my brother and I were born. It was a beautiful snowy morning on @DATE... Christmas! My sister, @PERSON in a bright yellow dress was @CAPS excited to be getting presents and cake! As soon as @CAPS opened a big battery powered monster truck, her beautiful clear blue eyes got as big as watermelons!  @PERSON walked over steddily, and climbed into the huge truck. There was only one problem, @CAPS couldn't reach the pedals. Everyone stood there, silent... then they started busting up laughing because @PERSON awkwardly looked like @CAPS was dancing in the truck beacuse @CAPS was trying to reach the pedals. Then my mom said, ""@CAPS someone should go help @PERSON get going on the truck."" @CAPS that was probably the worst idea ever!  My @CAPS is @NUM years old, and about @NUM pounds, and not in the best shape. @CAPS said annoyed, ""@CAPS I'll help @PERSON."" @CAPS rolled up off the couch and stood by @PERSON and the truck. My dad was giggling in the background. My @CAPS said seriously,""I need a stick or something to push on the ""go"" pedal."" @CAPS went and found a long stick outside in the snow. They decided that they should try it outside because @PERSON wanted to feel the chilling wind on her baby soft face as @CAPS was riding in the truck. @CAPS my mom bundled up @PERSON in @NUM jackets, gloves, and a beanie. Somehow they got on top of a @NUM foot snowy, and slippery hill we live on. My @CAPS pushed down on the ""go"" pedal and it went forward @CAPS the front tires got caught on her long dress @CAPS was wearing and ran her over!

12409,20913,8," Laughter  @CAPS brings enthusiasm and joyfulness to any means or matter. Have you ever thought of laughter being a part or key element in a relationship? A time when laughter has really helped or made a relationship is when I met one of my still today best friends. I had just started fifth grade at a new school; I transferred from private to public. There was only a couple of people I knew there because of family, and these people were my cousins. As you can imagine I sat by the people whom I known for most of my life, and being in this position was very awkward. So, eventually at the end of the day I was ready to leave school and it was my first time I ever got to walk home since this school was much closer than my last. I had to walk home with a kid who lived right by me; this I had never known because of my sheltered young life. Luckily he was easy to talk to and we both had something in common which was skateboarding. This is when we started @CAPS because we talked about certain falls we had which were not so pleasant and he asked if we could hang out after school, and with me as a shy guy I said okay. After awhile, he came over with his skateboard and he told me to go down this ramp I had. So, I did and fell right on my back which we both thought was hilarious and we started @CAPS together. This @CAPS we did since walking home really made me feel comfortable with him and kind of bonded us. I feel that fall was a key part of our friendship because it made the awkwardness go right out the window and helped us start talking about more funny thing which we had seen. Ever since, every time we hang out something happens and we laugh as hard as you can imagine which goes down in our memories as good times. @CAPS has always ""sweetened the mood"" so to say and always makes a good time a great time to remember or to a truly boring time to a ""lets go do something"" time. Also, in any situation when I have been @CAPS, or start to laugh, I feel good because every one laughs when I laugh. Most of my friends are also my friends because of my laughs and times I make them laugh. All in all, most of the relationships I have are because of @CAPS and how they comfort two or even more people by bonding them, and making every one feel like their having a good time with each other. This is key because than most encounters with people, even friends can be very awkward or not enjoyable. So, really in any case @CAPS is necessity because than every thing would be dull, plus you would really have no one to be able to have an appreciative time with. Therefore, every time I meet someone new or even someone I know laughter needs to exist in order to have a relationship with anyone.",15,19,34.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0

I know now that all it takes is for two people to laugh together to become great friends. My best friends, @PERSON and @PERSON became my friends by doing @CAPS that. All my life I've gone to small schools with my aunt, @LOCATION. We are only two years apart so we usually can stay within the same @ORGANIZATION, so I never feel alone. @CAPS @CAPS ended up going to a different @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION than me. I would have to face @ORGANIZATION on my own. My freshman year of @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION, I was pretty nervous. It was my first time at a huge @ORGANIZATION, I had @CAPS moved and I didn't know anyone, so I was pretty shy. I made my first friend pretty easily during one of my classes; @CAPS. @PERSON, the teacher, wanted us to have partners, so that we could do a certain exercise together. @PERSON and I both chose each other for some reason, I don't know how, @CAPS we were drawn to each other. @PERSON told us we would be doing the ""mirror exercise"". We picked somebody to be the mover, and somebody to be the mirror. @PERSON ended up being the mover. I had to follow her movements exactly so that @PERSON wouldn't be able to tell who the mirror was, @CAPS when @PERSON started acting like a monkey, we both laughed and @PERSON even laughed too. During lunch, @PERSON introduced me to her friend, @PERSON. @CAPS claimed to have known her for several years. @PERSON and I smiled at each other, @CAPS we didn't really talk at all. By the time my last class of the day came around, I was ready to go home, @CAPS because it was a @CAPS class, I never really liked @CAPS. I came to find that I shared that class with <@NUM!</@CAPS> @CAPS we met already, and shared @PERSON as a friend, we sat by each other. We still didn't have much to say though. A few days went by and we still didn't really talk, we @CAPS awkwardly sat next to one another. Meanwhile, @PERSON and I became closer friends, acting out silly skits together in @CAPS class laughter was bringing us together, @CAPS I didn't really notice, because it wasn't any different then how I've made most of my friends.  One day, we had testing in our @CAPS class, we had to go to the computer lab. @PERSON and I chose computers next to each other, we started our tests silently, same as always. Then, suddenly @CAPS turned to me and asked me if I had ever heard the ""@CAPS @CAPS"". When I, very startled, replied no, @CAPS sang it for me, right there in the middle of the computer lab. When @CAPS finished we both started laughing so hard that it hurt. Our teacher warned us to be quiet, and we got back to testing with smiles on our faces. After that moment, everything changed! Like magic, @PERSON and I started talking and joking all the time! @PERSON noticed the change, @CAPS was glad we were getting along so well, @CAPS wondered what caused the sudden difference. To this day, @PERSON and I share laughs whenever we have the time for it. Even though I am busy with babysitting, @ORGANIZATION, and my job. While @CAPS goes to college, nothing can stop the connection we made that day, through the power of laughter! I have learned that laughter is a top basis for any relationship. @CAPS it is not the only one. You also need to have trust. If you can't trust some one, @CAPS they are humorous, that doesn't make them a good friend. You also need a sense of safety. If your friends are encouraging you to do something that makes you feel uncomfortable, they aren't very good friends. I know that @PERSON and @PERSON are the best friends I will ever have.

""@CAPS some dead animal."" @CAPS had been a few hours since we talked, the brown dot getting a little bit bigger as we drew closer. I still couldn't make out @CAPS @CAPS was, but I knew @CAPS I hoped for @CAPS to be.

""@CAPS, @CAPS else?"" @CAPS searching through old dusty papers I managed to find a rock hard piece of gum, a cigar stub, and a half empty bottle of @CAPS I'd hoped to be @CAPS. Oh @CAPS I'd given for that bottle to have been filled with @CAPS. Whiskey was all that I @CAPS inside the bottle. Getting out of the dirty automobile I @CAPS @PERSON sitting against the front tire.

12412,20916,8," Laughter is like feeling your alive, that nothing else matters, the pain in your life releasing, and the feeling that everything is alright. You laugh when things are funny and sometimes even laugh when they aren't funny maybe to make someone feel better or just to relax a little. When someone tells you a joke and its hilarious do you just sit and stare at them, or do you fall on the ground laughing? Personally I fall on the ground laughing hysterically. You can have the best of times when your laughing it lightens the mood a little, makes it less tense in the environment. I have enjoyed many times by laughing at the silly things we do or at the dumbest things we do and make them not as bad by laughing about it. My friend and I have been going on adventures since the third grade. We go on walks and get lost, we built forts in the middle of nowhere, we road her quad out to the sandy race tracks, and we climbed over fences to pass the time. Every little adventure we went on came back with a laugh and a huge story to tell are friends and family. After all these adventures and growing up you seem to lose interest but you never forget the good times you have. Let me tell you about a good time I had laughing so hard I even started crying. When your little you think things are a @CAPS more challenging @CAPS they really are, or things are a @CAPS more taller @CAPS they really are but that didn't stop me. When @PERSON and I were about @NUM years old we loved playing outside, climbing the trees, burying old treasures to find when we grew up, and spying on the neighbors. Well on this particular day @PERSON and I chose to ""spy"" on the neighbors. We enjoyed doing this cause they had kids, animals, and tons of cars so they were outside A @CAPS. @PERSON's dad had about ten tires just laying right next to their fence so usually we would stand on them plus on are toes just to peek over, but this time we felt that would be to obvious we needed to be more sneaky, more like a spike, and more secretive. Eventually @PERSON's dad left to work and he stays gone for quite some time so we had things to prepare for. We thought of every possible way to look over the fence from drilling a hole to sitting on top of the shed. Finally after time to think about it we had the perfect idea to climb on the trash can and sit down and spy on them. Being brave as I was I volunteered to go first to make sure it would work so that after I was done @ORGANIZATION could try. Don't climb on trash cans next to a wooden fence, things don't turn out like you would of expected. As I got on top of the trash can it starts to shake and I was afraid so I held on to the top of the fence but the problem with that is I pushed the trash can further away from me causing it to tip over and me to hold on to the fence leaving me with the worst scraped hands I have ever seen. After the wild adventure we had I needed something to cool down my hands fast cause they were burning. So we had the idea to look in her dads shop van through the first aid kit but well we were in there I noticed a small fan hanging next to the radio so I turned it on and placed my hands in front of it for a good half hour. @CAPS @ORGANIZATION and I started talking about what had happened I thought about everything and couldn't stop laughing it made me cry because I was laughing so hard. Without laughter @PERSON and I wouldn't have the friendship we have today.  Laughing is the main source for friendship I feel. All the adventures @PERSON and I share, well they wouldn't be the same without laughing at it afterward. You can look back at things and be like, ""@CAPS that really sucked."" Or you can look at things and be like, ""That is hilarious."" @CAPS laugh tell you cry. I could see laughter being the shortest distance between two people because it helps make things less awkward, helps you realize your mistakes and joke about them, and it helps you be you without having to pretend your someone else. If friendships were based without laughter I don't know if they would be as good, well at least I know some of them for sure wouldn't be the same.",20,17,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12413,20917,8,"  The comfort of a laugh. Many different kinds of comfort can come from a laugh. My story is the comfort of love. @CAPS i was a young and foolish teen. (@CAPS wait that's what i would still be today.) A few days ago my friend @CAPS had me laughing so hard, and all because @CAPS slipped up while meeting my mother. (@CAPS was nerves to meet my mother.) For some reason @CAPS i started to laugh @CAPS suddenly began to act as if every thing was fine, and that there was nothing to be nerves about.  @CAPS latter @CAPS we went for our walk i asked him about it. I simply said ""@CAPS did your mood change @CAPS i began to laugh?"" @CAPS smiled and replied ""@CAPS you laugh i feel calm and know that i am going to be alright."" @CAPS myself being a typical teen girl i blushed, @CAPS quickly changed topics, while trying not to make eye contact. Suddenly i could not help my self. The feeling of his eyes on my cheek was over powering my will to not look. Turning my head slowly, sure enough there @CAPS was starring straight back in to my eyes, his eyes were wonderful they reminded me of sunflowers with a blue sky behind them. As @CAPS stared back i got a feeling as if @CAPS were trying to unlock all that i am, and all that i know with his eyes. As if @CAPS could see straight to my soul. Quickly I turned away. With a soft and almost beautiful voice @CAPS let a little laugh out. This laugh was as sweet to my ears, as nectar is to a hummingbird.  The next few days where hard. All i could think about was that walk. People must have thought i was crazy, every time i would remember the walk, each time i would remember his laugh. @CAPS let a laugh of my own out. @CAPS i realized that laughter plays a big role in every ones life. For me i laugh @CAPS I'm with the people i love. For some its watching t.v. that they find amusing, or maybe there kids did some thing rather silly. So silly you had to tell your book club. The point is that laughter is every where.  Laughter is never a bad thing in fact it has been proven that laughter has a lot of health benefits. Some people don't get it. Laughter is not some thing to be ashamed of ether, if some one laughs at you just laugh with them. Its not laughter that starts wars. its not laughter that kills people. its people who chose not to fill there lives with the joy of laughter.  So here is the goal. laughter can also be very contagious. So try and @CAPS a laugh on. Do some thing that @CAPS people remember it they will start there own laughs.

To me laughter is what makes people so unique. Everybody has a different kind of laugh. For example, when you are a baby @CAPS laugh is high pitched. The older you get the lower @CAPS laugh becomes, ""like @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION"". If it was not for his laugh would not be who he is. When I was a child I remember trying to laugh like just like @ORGANIZATION did. I would be walking around the house trying to get my laugh really @CAPS. My family though it was the best thing ever. They would ask me to laugh like @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION so they can get a laugh also.  Now today my laugh is what I wanted it to be, ""@CAPS"". It is hard for me to laugh quietly now. I have had some people tell me things like; ""@CAPS laugh is what I will remember you by"" or ""@CAPS laugh is really something else"". I love my laugh because it is part of who I am.

So me and my little brother took two jugs of chocolate syrup, and poor them all over my aunts brand new three thousand dollar couch.    The second prank was just myself, and one day i was playing video games and my aunt was getting ready for work. I was getting very frustrated with the game and i threw my controller down, man my aunt ran over and pop me in the back of my head so fast,and she told me to be a good sport and try it again.

12417,20921,8," Being with family and friends during a memorable trip always seems to spark a smile. There are always times to look back on; whether they are fond memories, or thoughts of nostalgia. I was about to graduate, and my parents had just broke the news to me that we were going on a trip to @LOCATION after the year was finished. We had the date set; @DATE, right after school was over. The first reaction out of my mouth was filled with entreatment, wishing for my best friend to join us on this trip. My parents took the time and thoughtfully considered all the advantages and disadvantages, and rapidly responded in the affirmative. I was thrilled to know that the memories I was about to create with my closest family members were now to include my best friend.  First thing was first, I had to get down to business. I needed to call my friend, @PERSON, and ask her if she'd like to come along. Selfishly assuming that her immediate response would be an exuberant ""@CAPS!,"" I was @CAPS first devastated when she postponed her response and didn'@CAPS seem too excited. I didn'@CAPS consider the fact that there @MONTH have been some sort of miscommunication. She talked it over with her mother, and gave me a call back. I had made the mistake of not telling her that we would have her financially covered for airfare, dining, and hotel rooms. We cleared everything up, and they decided she @CAPS join us. The two of us together couldn'@CAPS have been more ecstatic if we tried! @PERSON and I made a countdown board that started around two months from our departure date. There were many factors that we would take into hand while planning. As we measured out exactly how much time we had, we also planned which landmarks, resorts, and shops we would visit. Our family friend lived in @LOCATION @CAPS the time, so she gave us a tour of the island. Having such a close acquaintance to guide us made the trip even more fun. She knew all the local hangout spots, and had access to the military beaches because she works in @ORGANIZATION!  Many humorous occurrences happened often while we were on that vacation, but some of the most memorable moments happened in the hotel while I was with @PERSON and my mother. My mom has always had a way to make every situation hilarious, so it was a blast when we went out on a girls night. First, and most significant of our adventures, we went shopping in the mall that was attached to our hotel. There was an abundance of varied small clothing stores, food shops, and jewelry outlets. One of our favorite stores that we visited was a @CAPS-shirt shop with chocolate infused fabrics! We spent so much time looking @CAPS all of the designs, that I think we ended up carrying a wave of cocoa with us for the rest of the night.  As soon as we finished our shopping quest in the town center, we worked our way back up to the room, laughing and involved in pointless girl talk. The three of us girls shuffled with smiles, sore feet, and new bags onto the elegant, ornately designed golden elevator. My mother pushed the button to take us to our floor, while @PERSON carried on a story about plans we had the night before. Absorbed in conversation, we hauled our new things down the long hallway to our room. Realizing that we didn'@CAPS have a key card to open our room's door, the three of us decided that we should just knock on the door and my father would answer. ""@CAPS was supposed to be back from renting our surf boards by now, so why isn'@CAPS @CAPS answering?"" we thought, ""@CAPS @CAPS still be out on the beach?"" @CAPS this point our conversation died down a bit as we tried to figure out what to do. I sent a message to my dad's cell phone, and @CAPS said @CAPS was in the room. We ended up pounding on the door for a good five minutes, assuming @CAPS was playing a joke on us by not answering. After waiting a few moments in confused silence, I began to notice a low buzzing voice coming from inside the room. I turned to my mother and best friend, and @CAPS barely keep from laughing. It was then that it hit me, and I said to both of them, ""@CAPS guys! We didn'@CAPS leave a @CAPS.V. on!"" We immediately halted our intrusion, moved as quickly as we @CAPS away from the door, and continued to howl with laughter. My mother had hit the wrong floor button on the elevator! We were so absorbed in having a good time that we didn'@CAPS even realize we were bothering someone, and embarassing ourselves! It wasn'@CAPS just one moment or one trip, it is now a lifetime of joy because I can look back on those memories and smile @CAPS them.

As I got closer to her, she seemed upset, yet when I asked what was bothering her, she did not wish to tell me. I didn't want to make things worse, so I left it alone. All I could thing about was what could I do to make her happy, so I started talking about the craziest things, not knowing if it would help or not. To my luck, it actually helped, and she started smiling. After a little while, I had her laughing and having a good time.

12419,20923,8,"            The Element of @CAPS and Laughter Laughter is an important element that a person could ever have when they are in a joyful or happy mood. Laughing is a good part in a persons life; it shows other people when you appreciate something that they did that put you in a good enough mood to share a laugh. Some people react in different ways when it comes to laughter because of their emotions; other people laugh to hilarious jokes and other types of people laugh at peoples accidents while others don't. Emotions are a big deal in a persons life. Some emotions are joy, sorrow, jealousy, fear or anger. Being happy makes people want to laugh at something. Sometimes when people laugh too much, they will actually start crying from it. People like other people @CAPS are in a happy or joyful mood, because then they can receive those good feelings as well; therefore, it makes other people happy to get more people to be in a positive attitude as well.  Another thing that makes people laugh are jokes. Some jokes can be very funny, other jokes can be gross, and some jokes can be really hilarious that you will always remember them. But jokes can get complicated at times; to a little kid you can say, ""@CAPS, @CAPS!"" ""@CAPS's there?"" ""@CAPS."" ""@CAPS @CAPS?"" ""@CAPS @CAPS?, don't cry about it, it was just a joke,"" and the kid would be laughing. But to someone @CAPS is older, you have to think a little more to get them to laugh. People love laughter; they like laughing at peoples jokes and especially at hilarious pranks. Sometimes pranks really aren't that funny. Like you seeing a friend of yours get something that spits out garlic and them knowing that the person that is about to get pranked is alergic to garlic. But most of the time, funny things help people cheer up when they are down. Furthermore, accidents are some things that can be really horrible at some times, but at other times, some of the accidents that occur in life can be very hilarious to some people. Some accidents people can decide whether to take it one way or the other. For example, a person might think that another person that is about to jump off of a diving board, but then slips and hits his back on the board is really funny and another person could disagree with that and take it in the opposite way and think that it was not funny at all. It is like when someone says that they a really funny joke or something hilarious to say, and you end up thinking that it was something that was bothersome or a tragedy or it could also be the other way around. You might think that you have something funny to say, but then to your friend it was something that really bothered them or something that they thought that wasn't funny at all. In other words, laughter is an important element that a person could ever have in their life. It is a part that a person can help another person when someone needs a good laugh to share with another person. Enjoy having good times with friends to share a couple of laughs, don't just be in a grumpy mood all the time, be happy. Laughter is a good thing; people love it so don't always be serious and at least share some laughs with your friends or loved ones.",13,19,34.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12420,20924,8,"Laughter Laughter can make a situation less uncomfortable, bring two people together or just show your having a good time. In my experiences laughter comes at the best of times. On a typical @ORGANIZATION day at @ORGANIZATION I was sitting with my friends at lunch time just hanging out talking about whats going on in our lives, when I notice a girl sitting all alone. I don't recognize her, she must be a new student. I ask around to see if anyone knows anything about her; no one knows. Looking back at the girl she looks very lonely and in need of a friend. Curious to meet someone new I walk over to her and make conversation after a little while we relax and start to talk about our interests. I remember her saying something funny and I started to laugh, she begins to laugh at my laugh being as its almost hysterical sounding and everyone thinks it sounds ridiculous. At that moment as were sitting there laughing together I realize, its bringing us together making us closer despite the fact we had just met but ten minutes ago.  Laughter makes life more enjoyable and happy knowing that you can share that with someone you have just met or someone you have known your whole life is magical.

12421,20925,8," There was this time during @CAPS vacation, and their was a lot of snow o n the ground. My cousin @CAPS, brother @CAPS and I were all getting together and going to go out to my grandparents. My brother @CAPS lives in @LOCATION and my cousin @CAPS, and I live here in @LOCATION. So it wasn't that hard trying to get us cousins all together. We were all getting together to go out to my grandparents and go snowmobiling together and stay the night out their for a couple of nights. When all got together, and were starting to go out there it was getting to late to go snowmobiling. We were all very kind of sad but it was okay. We just watched movies off direct @LOCATION, and waited for the morning to come. Once morning came of course it was way to cold to go out right when we woke up. So we made a big breakfast and after breakfast we all got ready and than sat around until it was warmer to go outside. Finally it was the afternoon! We all got dressed into warm clothes to go out an go snowmobiling. We all went outside and my grandpa had one of the snowmobiles ready for us and behind it was the hood of a truck so he could pull us from behind with it. My grandpa was driving the snowmobile and us kids were in the back. My grandma only went one once with us and than she got off because my grandpa was going way to crazy n we were all getting hit by each other when he was driving. Then once us kids were the only ones on the hood by grandpa was starting to go really fast! I was the only one who was covered in snow, and i looked like a snowman. It was so funny! My grandpa went running inside to get my grandpas camera so she could take some pictures. It took her awhile to take them though because she is not that good or fast at taking pictures. Then when she was done we went back to snowmobiling for the rest of the day. After we got all done for the day I than really looked like a snowman. It was a fun day, and very funny how I looked as a snowman, but afterwords I got really cold. We went inside and I went right in front of the heater to warm up while my grandma was making hot chocolate for all of us.",18,12,30.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12422,20926,8," We were heading to our first ski race. On either side of me, my friends @CAPS and @PERSON sat, crammed together in our team van. Our packed bags and ski gear filled the vehicle to the top, along with six other kids, occupying all of the other empty spaces. Our uncomfortable seating arrangements didn't seem to ruin our fun, within five minutes of our road trip, the van exploded with laughter, as @PERSON, most likely a future comedian started off cracking jokes, just being himself as usual. Within those first five minutes of our drive, I could already tell that this was going to be a ski trip I would always remember.  The van rolled up to the hotel parking lot. My ski team would be lodging here for the long weekend. The sky had turned black with the @TIME, and me along with everyone else trudged along with weary eyes, exhausted from the long drive. We quickly unloaded our bags, all eager to hop into our beds, needing to be well rested for our first ski race of the season. Shortly after, everyone was soon in bed, knowing that five a.m. would be coming quickly. The sun began rising over the mountains, signaling time to wake up. This was not the case for me. I had been up for nearly an hour, and sat in our van while we sped around each corner up to the mountain. It was race day, and me, along with all of my teammates were all excited for the day coming. The morning flew by, collecting our bibs at registration, getting our lift tickets, and inspection of the course. I now stood at the top of the hill peering down at the course ahead of me. I had to focus. While I have had a lot of fun, it was time to concentrate, to preform my absolute best. The pressure was on. I now stood in the start gate, my coach stood by my side, and my friends were watching as well, cheering me on. I was hoping not to disappoint. ""@CAPS ready,"" the official began in a tense voice, ""@CAPS!"" I threw my self our of the start gate. I flew by each gate, staying in control and most important, going fast. The wind slid past my aerodynamic body, my ankles and knees rolled with each turn. Everything was going well until I broke over the knoll. My body compressed bringing my knees to my chest, as I skied over the roller, throwing me off balance. I fought to get back up, to regain myself, but I couldn't do it. My skis spun out from under me, causing me to be spit out from the course, landing on my back, sliding down the mountain, hopeless and done for. It was over. I sat in the snow frustrated with my performance. I wanted a second chance that I wasn't going to get. @PERSON, one of my teammates, came up to me and sat in the snow by my side. My first thought was he was going to say something of a cliche ""nice job,"" or a ""you'll do better next time"". To my surprise he tells me one of his ridiculous jokes. My mouth turns up, trying to contain a laugh, unsuccessful, I burst into laughter. @PERSON sits there and smiles at me. Almost immediately I found myself in a better mood. I give him a quick ""thanks,"" with a smile before we both @CAPS to watch and cheer on our teammates. Although I didn't do my best, I didn't let my results ruin my weekend. The next day, I skied two solid runs with top finishes, if I had stayed upset with myself, I would have never been able to achieve those results. I came to realize that some days, just a small laugh can be all you need to turn any day around. Laughter, I have found is essential in any situation. It's a connection that can bring anyone closer. For me, laughter changed my personality that day on the mountain. Laughter can mean many different things for many different people, laughter could be a special bond between to people. Laughter can remove the seriousness or competitively in a situation, but also it unites us. Languages are different among people, but everyone understands a what a laugh can do, a laugh is universal.",24,23,0.0,47,0.0,0.0,0.0,47.0

When I think of laughter, I think of the times when I go to @ORGANIZATION. Even @CAPS I have had the most horrible day, I know that the girls I play with on that team, who are like a second family to me, can always cheer me up by the things they say or do. The underlying relationship between a @ORGANIZATION team becomes unknown to the outside; no one really knows how much we laugh together, or how much frustration builds up between us. Frustration @MONTH get the best of us sometimes but I can think of a lot more memories where I was laying on the turf field laughing because a dumb decision of a player, turns into on of the funniest things I've ever seen.  I remember the first time I had a @ORGANIZATION practice, back in @DATE of second grade, I was playing with many girls who had gone to a different school and I had never seen before. All of the girls decided that they wanted to see who was the best at juggling a @ORGANIZATION ball on there knees. It came my turn to try, and as i went to bump it with my knee, it hit in the wrong spot so it came back up and hit me in the nose, leaving it bloody. I had no idea how to react, so I started to laugh. At the time, a girl I had never seen before started to laugh with me, and came up and gave me a tissue. Believe it or not the girl who gave me a tissue that first day became my best friend, and has been ever since. The laughter that occurred that day filled the gap of distance between us. Since that day we have never had an awkward silence wondering what we should say or do.   Entering the fall of fourth grade, I had just joined the @ORGANIZATION team @ORGANIZATION, still playing with the same girls, with the exception of a few people. I had no idea what to think of those people or what to say, so i decided on not saying anything. We had been playing monkey in the middle and I was guarding a short blond girl named @CAPS, who had extremely good talents but was a little clumsy. She had started to run for the ball, and low and behold the clumsy girl tripped on nothing! Thoughts were racing through my mind; should I laugh? Will she hate me @CAPS I do? What @CAPS she's actually hurt? Though these thoughts @MONTH become reality, I went with my instinct and burst with laughter. She rolled over to see who had starting laughing at her accidental trip, and started laughing as well. After the incident, we got up and started talking, realizing we had gone to the same school but never associated with one another. From that day on we became inseparable at school, and became best friends.  The next story has nothing to do with @ORGANIZATION, but everything to do with laughter. Though there is no certain story that I could tell you in particular that happened between this girl and I, all I can say is she is the one who gave me the first experience of laughing until you cry. I remember her moving to our school, and I was no longer the ""new girl"". At first, I thought she was the weirdest person that I had ever met, but as time progressed I had come to find out that she @MONTH be one of the funniest people I have ever met. @CAPS I would have made the realization beforehand that this girl had the personality she did, I would have went up to her in a heartbeat and made friends, instead of hiding behind the crowd. Ever since we became friends our friendship has been based upon how much we laugh together, and I wouldn't have it an other way. In the end the person who once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", was absolutely correct. I used these stories above to show no matter how shy, or awkward a person @MONTH be, sharing a laugh with a new person is the easiest way to find a best friend. When I was introduced to laughter by these three people, I started to become more social throughout my middle school years, and now onto my high school career as well. @CAPS I lived a life without laughter, I would lose the life I have, and it would be filled with dull memories that are not worth sharing, and to me, that is definitely not worth it. Over the past six years, I have gained three best friends due to laughter, this really does go to show that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and is truly a @CAPS to have it.",20,16,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0

Our relation was tense during that month. We talked a few times but his voice was different. There was a sadness to it and I knew something was wrong. Although he said everything was good I knew his sadness was due to my absence.  After the month had finally ended it was time to come back to @LOCATION! I was truly excited. We arrived at @LOCATION, @LOCATION at @TIME on a @DATE @TIME. I immediately called him but there was no chance of seeing him that same @TIME. Although, just knowing that I was closer to him made me happy and anxious. We conversed for endless hours, telling each other that we would never be that far again. We laughed and laughed during our whole conversation. To me the sound of his laughter was a sign of his happiness and that was just priceless. The laughter was as if it had been a blessing to our relation. From that day on forward, I realized how much laughter really affects me in numerous ways. It's as if it brings happiness and prosperity to my life. With just a laugh sadness leaves and that's when happiness jumps in.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

All I can remember, vividly, in my mind is the look on my grandfathers face. He had on the same smile he always wore during times of joy. It was a wide warm grin he would shine your way every so often. As I laughed uncontrollably that @DATE, so many years ago, he shined his happiness @CAPS love down on me for so long that I will never forget a single wrinkle in his grin. My @CAPS, who we all called @CAPS, had a way of keeping the peace @CAPS happiness in everything. No matter how bad things were within our family, he would always make things right. No one could get angry @CAPS @CAPS, @CAPS no one could stay sad when he smiled. That's just the kind of guy he was. @CAPS was a big part of our family gatherings, just like the one we had on my @DATE @DATE @CAPS @CAPS. That @DATE was our family's @DATE @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS, soon after, he passed away. When I look back @CAPS realize how important that @DATE was I can see that it was a perfect @CAPS for everyone. It was a happy @DATE @CAPS my @DATE memories of my @CAPS were of his great big happy grin shining down on me while I giggled away during a card game.     When that @CAPS kicked off, in the early morning, the weather was already proving to be spectacular. Every one in my family was in high spirits @CAPS was ready to enjoy the @DATE @CAPS family. My favorite activity during each @CAPS every family event is to play my favorite games @CAPS everyone. Our family has a few specific games that are a tradition during family gatherings. One of our favorites is called @CAPS-@CAPS. Now @CAPS-@CAPS was one of the many games that my @CAPS was very good at playing. He rarely ever lost a game, @CAPS would not finish playing until he had won at least once. So when everyone was assembled at our house, I convinced @CAPS @CAPS my cousin @PERSON to play @CAPS-@CAPS @CAPS me. We went into the spare room @CAPS starting dealing out the cards. About a half an hour later we were still playing, @CAPS to no ones surprise, @CAPS was winning. It was just before the food was ready @CAPS we were about halfway through the game when either my cousin @PERSON, or @CAPS said something to me that I thought was the funniest thing my tiny @NUM year old ears had ever heard, @CAPS I began to laugh.     My family was so thoroughly entertained @CAPS my laughter that they could not keep their smiles @CAPS laughter tucked away without bursting into giggles as bad as mine. It seemed that my senseless laughing created instant joy to my family, including my @CAPS. @CAPS' smile was one of the greatest things my little eyes looked up at during my childhood. It was something so imaginary, yet so colorful @CAPS vivid in front of me,that I would worship his smile like I was seeing my first solar eclipse. I never quite understood, at such a young age what was so fascinating about his smile, but now I do understand. @CAPS' smile showed true, wholesome, unbreakable joy. His smile didn't come out all too often so when it did, you knew something good was happening.    No one knew that was our @DATE @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS. I most certainly could not imagine it to be the @DATE I would spend @CAPS my @CAPS. Everything was so perfect @CAPS so increasingly happy, it seemed to be a crime to end his life during such a time of joy. Although if I were him, @CAPS if I had to choose my @DATE @CAPS, that @DATE would be perfect. My single memory of that @DATE was laughing, @CAPS being happy. I can't think of any better way to spend my @DATE bit a time @CAPS @CAPS then a @DATE where we were both completely satisfied in our card game, laughter, @CAPS smiles.    Laughter is a funny thing. It is unique in every person, @CAPS can range from any kind of humor to pure happiness. Laughter brings hope in times of doubt @CAPS never fails to make someone smile. Someone, somewhere started a quote that says, ""@CAPS. Laugh. Love."" I believe those three words can combine together, @CAPS act separately to sum up a perfect life for anyone willing to @CAPS out the true, meaningful definition of each of those words. Laughter brings smiles of happiness, humor, @CAPS love. Love brings us all together, @CAPS when we strive to be happy @CAPS to love, that is when we can truly @CAPS. My grandfather loved each @CAPS every one of his family @CAPS friends @CAPS made a priority of keeping them happy. He lived his life the best way that I believe anyone could ever @CAPS it.

12427,20931,8," Some people say that laughter is good for the soul, and that could be true, but the soul is definitely not the only thing. Laughing is great for your heart and mind too. It can improve relationships, make friendships grow stronger, and even start @CAPS make two people who don't know anything about each other, extremely close. You can meet someone new or be with someone you barely know, and just because they make you laugh you feel like you want @CAPS get @CAPS know them better. I love that feeling. Honestly, you can laugh with any age or gender. You don't both have @CAPS be @NUM and female, you could be with a little boy, an elderly lady, or anywhere in between and still have a lot of fun. Last @DATE I never had anything @CAPS do, so I decided I should start volunteering places. The two places I could volunteer at were: a daycare next @CAPS my house, or an old folks home about @NUM miles away. I thought really hard about it, trying @CAPS make the best decision for me. I couldn't make up my mind, and even though I didn't admit it, I felt like they would be just as boring as sitting at home. I finally decided I should do both of them, so I could meet some new people, and have new experiences. I started with the daycare. I woke up at @NUM am, and walked @CAPS @ORGANIZATION. I wasn't sure what it was going @CAPS be like at all. I didn't even know if i was good with kids. I walked in, and stood @CAPS awkwardly. The @ORGANIZATION manager came up @CAPS me and asked me if i could help out with the @NUM year old's coloring room. I nodded my head nervously.  Was i supposed @CAPS color for them? @CAPS's no way they could color a picture by themselves. They're only three! I thought. Oh well, if i follow directions then this day will get @CAPS faster. When i went in @CAPS all the kids ran up @CAPS me with a smile on their face. ""@CAPS by me!"" one said. ""@CAPS here!"" said another. ""@CAPS's a spot right here!"" ""@CAPS at my picture!"" ""I drew a rainbow!"" ""I drew a car!"" ""I drew you!"" @CAPS that, i looked down. @CAPS i was, on the piece of paper. A bunch of blue and green scribbles. That day was a lot of fun. I was laughing and having a great time with the kids. I learned that i absolutely adore kids, and I'm actually pretty good with them. The next week a went @CAPS the nursing home. I was even more nervous @CAPS. I felt so out of place. I hadn't found out what I was going @CAPS be helping with yet, so I sat on a chair in the lobby. When the receptionist asked who i was her @CAPS see, i said nobody. She then asked me why I was here, and I replied, oh, I was going @CAPS volunteer. She led me down the hall told me that it was almost time for lunch so i needed @CAPS get ready @CAPS serve lunch. I did, and then the i heard, what i assumed was, the lunch bell. I gave everyone their lunch with a big smile and it was honestly great. If one of them looked a little down, or upset I could flash them a smile and they would grin back, obviously in higher spirits than before. After lunch, I played a few games of chess. Most people who were @CAPS took naps after lunch, so @CAPS were only three people out @CAPS. I played first with a lady who used @CAPS be a nurse. I got @CAPS know her pretty well in the half hour we played the game; which i won. Next was a guy who was a veteran. He fought in the @LOCATION war. He seemed really nice, but serious. I won that game too. The last man used @CAPS be a comedian. He was so funny. He told jokes the whole game! Maybe he said a few @CAPS many, because he beat me at chess. Well that was my excuse. When i got done, i was in a great mod and i could't wait @CAPS come back again. I learned a lot that @DATE. I found out everyone is alike in some ways, even though each person is unique. I realized you don't have @CAPS be the same as the person your with, @CAPS laugh and have a good time. It doesn't matter what age, race, gender, size, mentality, maturity, etc. The only thing that matters is that you are in the same place at the same time, trying @CAPS make the best of your day. I am so glad i decided @CAPS volunteer, otherwise i would have never known so much about people, love, life, and laughter.",20,21,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0
12428,20932,8," Looking back on my early childhood, one thing that stands out bright and shiny in my memory is laughter. Since birth, I have always loved to smile and laugh. I've found a kind of comfort, peace, and confidence through laughter alone, which I doubt I would have been able to find somewhere else naturally. This could, in part, be because of my @CAPS. We rarely get to see each other because he lives in @LOCATION and I live in @LOCATION, but when we do have the luxury of spending time together, it is always full of laughter, and full of joy. I credit him for giving my my love for laughter. I've been told by my parents that as a baby all my @CAPS had to do was laugh, and my eyes brightened and a smile became apparent as wide as the @LOCATION on my face. It's been that way ever since. One of my earliest memories I have is laying on my parent's bed listening to my @CAPS tell me jokes. Every time he finished I would erupt in laughter, and, at the sight of me laughing, he would burst out too. The important detail to note is, when my @CAPS laughs, his belly shakes violently like @ORGANIZATION. I found this the greatest part of the jokes. Once his belly started bouncing up and down, my laughter became uncontrollable. Our laughter escalated until tears were streaming down our faces. Besides having a belly that bounces when he laughs, my @CAPS has one of the most distinctive and contagious laughs one has ever been lucky enough to hear. It's one of those fabulous and enriching laughs which words do not do justice, but once you hear it, you won't ever forget it. His laughter can light up the darkest room in a house. For me, his laugh almost has medicinal healing. Whenever I hear my @CAPS laugh, for just a moment, the world stops, and everything within is okay. I am not the only one who has a great appreciation for my @CAPS's laugh. My father and him both have a love for telling jokes, which I have observed over the years, is one of the few items they hold a common agreement on. Everything from politics, to religion, to who should pay for dinner, usually ends in an argument between them. Because of that, they tend to stay clear of those topics for fear of confrontation. They have never mentioned this, but from my observation over the years, I've come to the conclusion that the laughter they share so often, acts as the glue which keeps their relationship strong. Were it not for laughter, I sometimes wonder if they would still have a working, loving relationship. I will forever be thankful for the great gift my @CAPS unknowingly gave me at such a young age. He created a deep and passionate love for laughter inside me, which has gotten me through the roughest times. I truly believe that laughter heals the soul and that when two people share a laugh, they are bonded for a moment in a precious, fragile, and sacred way. My day can be going horribly, and in the instant that a joke is cracked, and laughter overwhelms my body, everything brightens and the worries and stresses of my day seem so minute. Finding humor in every situation is another lesson that my @CAPS taught me. If you can find humor, you can find serenity in the most disastrous moments. Laughter, to me, is somewhat like a drug. It's a harmless, enriching, and life-saving drug which I can proudly say I hope to be addicted to for the rest of my life, thanks to my @CAPS.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12429,20933,8,"Laughter is such a marvelous element to have in any relationship. For instance if you can't find any form of humor in a relationship than I'm pretty sure there is no strong connection between the two of you. For example I was in a relationship once where we didn't have that element of humor, and I truthfully did not enjoy that relationship that her and I had. Any type of relationship needs laughter rather its friendships, boyfriend or girlfriends, and even family. All different types of relationships need some form of humor to survive. Sometimes families don't have that humor for each other but they'll still have that special type of a friendship, the reason for that I believe is because your family will always be there for you unlike most friends would. One way I know this because one of my friends really liked a guy, I could have sworn she @MONTH have even loved him, when he told her that he started dating some girl, she had cried for weeks, than when she was at her moms house one of her brothers she believed hated her said he wants to hurt the guy that had made his younger sister cry. They @MONTH not of had a humorous friendship, or even a friendship at all, but I believe laughter isn't necessarily always needed especially within family. All types of relationships are like plants, the flower is the relationship and laughter is the water that will help the relationship grow big and strong. But without that water the plant wont grow, just like laughter in a relationship. I know that if I knew someone who I did not find to be humorous I know our friendship would not be very strong, unlike someone who I felt was hilarious. Laughter is always a important element in everyday life. For instance if you are going for a job interview you really need to connect with the person interviewing you and make a good impression for yourself. One way of doing that is through laughter, I have heard of many stories about job interviews, a example of one is my mom had a interview not to long ago for a @CAPS job and she told me about her interview and she said they had really connected. Their was also some seriousness and some laughter in that interview than three days later they emailed her and told her that she got the job and that they would love to hire her. and I have heard of interviews where they didn't get the job. My sister had a interview once for a pet kennel type of place where they drop their pets off there while they go on vacation, and she said that her and the person interviewing her had no connection which had led to no humor or laughter. So I believe humor is such a marvelous element to have within a relationship because with laughter comes greatness and happiness.",17,15,0.0,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.0
12430,20935,8," Laughter is key. You never really think about laughter in importance, but the truth is, laughing brings the most opposite people together. Last year, I met one of my brothers friends in school. We never really talked but she seemed nice. We had a class together and we started talking more and more everyday and she was best friends with my best friend.  @PERSON was her name and she drove a bright orange @ORGANIZATION. We hung out after school one day and I leaned the passenger seat all the way back and was sitting on it like a dog and she slammed on the brakes and I flew into the front of the vehicle and I couldn't stop laughing. At that moment I knew we were going to be friends. I was a freshman so I didn't really know anyone and she was always nice to everyone so we started hanging out more. I lived about @NUM miles out of town and her brothers went to school about @NUM miles past my house so we had to go pick them up. We bought a game called '@CAPS @CAPS' and there are tons of little jellbeans that were flavored like vomit, centipede, dirt, rotten egg, etc.. So we were playing while we were driving out there and @CAPS had to stop the car nearly @NUM times in our @NUM mile drive! Those were the nastiest beans ever! Then, we would drive out to my house and we'd listen to our favorite country songs and blast them in her car. She was my ultimate best friend and no one could replace her. Whenever we would get in fights we wouldn't start drama, we'd always have an actual fight because by the time one of us were pinned the other was laughing too hard to do anything about it. Her dad and my dad became friends later on too and we would always have barbeque's and family get togethers.  We also talked in a @CAPS accent all the time because one of our friends was from @LOCATION. Whenever we went to @CAPS to go shopping we'd use our accent and everywhere we went people would ask us where we were from. Before we knew it our dads started talking like us. We also created a bunch of slang words and then the whole school started using them. She is a great friend and she keeps me laughing everyday. Whenever @PERSON was having problems with her family she knew she could always talk to me and I would always be there for her. She always called me sister instead of @CAPS because we were so close. She used to take @CAPS and @CAPS classes at my old high school and when she got the fake baby doll it would keep us up late into the @TIME, that baby was crazy. @PERSON would be driving and the baby would start screaming in its car seat and we'd have to pull over and find out what was wrong with it. She'd be a good mom. She always cared for things, even the smallest little thing she would cherish.  One time, we painted her little brothers room because we were bored and @PERSON was rolling her paintbrush in paint and texting and she took her eye off of her phone and dropped it in the paint. She couldn't find it for like @NUM minutes and by the time she did find it it was totally covered in green paint! I laughed at her for so long and those are the moments I wish I could bring back.  Everytime we hung out I would laugh and I realize now how important that laughter is to me. About six months ago I moved to a whole different state and I don't see her very often. There is no one like @PERSON. She could make me laugh and was always just @NUM minutes away when I needed something, now I have to drive about @NUM hours to even see her. I haven't laughed like she made me ever since I went back to visit. Laughter is key, as I stated before and if you frown, you'll never know who is falling in love with your smile.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12431,20936,8," A few years ago, when I was @NUM, I decided to do an experiment on laughing and the color of the clothes people wear. I realized that I laughed a lot and I was almost always happy because of @CAPS, I did really @CAPS in school, and I also had a very 'up' attitude. @CAPS clothes were all very bright and 'happy' colors. I had a theory that the less someone laughed, and the darker colored clothes they wore, would make their mood and attitude would dip. The experiment would last one week, and in that time I would try @CAPS to laugh and gradually start wearing darker and darker clothes until I got to black, to see how I would be affected, if affected at all. To get started, I had to first tell everyone what I was doing and ask them to try @CAPS to make me laugh on purpose. Then I had to go to the store and get new clothes that had no bright colors on them. That was the hardest part because I saw a lot of cute clothes, but they were too colorful. After that i only had to wait for the @DATE to end and @DATE to begin. @DATE @TIME I woke up and did @CAPS usual daily routine, then tried on @CAPS new clothes. When I got to school, I noticed the surprised looks from @CAPS classmates @CAPS they took in @CAPS outfit. @CAPS was pretty tough @CAPS to laugh at some of their expressions but I couldn't, because that would ruin what I was trying to accomplish. Throughout the day, I got comments on @CAPS clothing, and some of @CAPS teachers were worried because I wasn't laughing @CAPS usual but when I told them of @CAPS experiment, they understood and said, ""@CAPS luck."" @CAPS the day came to an end, I was satisfied with @CAPS success and quickly fell asleep. The next two days went pretty much the same, and I was wondering if @CAPS theory would be proven wrong. But on @DATE @TIME @CAPS mom pointed out that I seemed different.  ""@CAPS @CAPS okay?"" she asked. ""@CAPS don't seem @CAPS energetic @TIME, and your @CAPS smiling at all. Your @CAPS sick @CAPS @CAPS?"" I told her that I was fine. At school, I was asked the same thing, and after a while @CAPS got really annoying. I got mad and yelled at them, which I never do, and they apologized. But I felt bad and told them I was sorry and they forgave me, telling me @CAPS was probably just the experiment. I got a little happier at the thought that @CAPS theory might just be correct. That day went by slowly, and I was glad when @CAPS ended. @DATE was the last day of @CAPS experiment and for that I was happy. I didn't mind the dark clothes and I liked the way they looked on me, but @CAPS was hard @CAPS laughing, and @CAPS was starting to make me feel depressed. That day I decided to wear some of @CAPS bright clothes to see if @CAPS would change anything, and when I got to school some of @CAPS friends didn't recognize me because they got used to seeing me in @CAPS other clothes. I didn't feel any different from when I wore @CAPS dark clothes. In @CAPS I had to stand in front of the class to give @CAPS conclusion. ""@CAPS theory has been proven semi-correct,"" I stated. ""@CAPS laughing did have an effect on @CAPS mood and attitude. I was yelling at @CAPS friends and feeling sad when I shouldn't have. But I found that wearing dark clothing didn't change anything."" @CAPS teacher then said something so funny that I couldn't help but laugh, and everyone applauded and said, ""@CAPS back @CAPS!"" @CAPS feels really @CAPS to laugh again.",18,20,44.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.0,44.0

Every time they came inside they repeatedly didn't shut the sliding glass door, finally my sister shut the door but her friend @PERSON didn't know, he was running so fast and before he knew it he was going fast first into a sliding glass door!  My dad and I were laughing so hard i almost peed myself. After we finally stopped laughing and went to go check on him and he looked really confused about what just happened. We looked at the door and without a doubt it had a slobber mark going up the door as if his face was slid across it. Meanwhile after more laughs and fun things calmed down and we went back to watching @CAPS. My dad fell asleep and his cat was laying next to him, my dad kind of woke up and looked around after a few minutes he started watching @CAPS again. My older brother walked into the room and saw that the cat was sleeping and took an advantage over it and slammed his hands on the chair.

12435,20942,8,"A @ORGANIZATION is a wondrous gift. It allows your mind and your body to conjoin with others. It is the root of happiness, and brings a sense of sanity to those who have lost hope. When you feel alone in the world with no one at your side, laughter will be there to accompany you. At one point in my life I felt confused and by myself. I was empty. Solitude was the only thing I could have, and the only feeling my mind would register. Just when I had thought that I @MONTH be the only person in the whole world, something had come to save me.  I was six years old when they got divorced. I couldn't stand to hear my parents fight. One day we were the perfect family. We would play board games and go to the movies together. Something had changed very quickly. My @CAPS grabbed his jacket, told me he loved me and then he was gone. Was I ever going to see him again? Why isn't @CAPS living with us? These are questions I kept asking myself. I think i was too young to truly know what was going on. The days were long and I found myself becoming sluggish and glum.  About two weeks after my @CAPS had left, some neighbors moved into the house adjacent to me and my mom. One of the neighbors looked young, about my age. I didn't think much of the new people in town. I told myself that people come and go. Nothing lasts forever, and I should expect the worst. One day I was riding my bike and thought that I should stop pedaling and crash into my fence. I hit the metal fence and simply fell over. I heard a laugh and turned around. It was the new neighbor kid. There he was rolling on the ground, grabbing at his sides. He must have thought of my crash as entertainment. I picked up my bike, began to move, then crashed once more. Another series of laughs sprang from this boy. That was the first time I had smiled in a long time. I grew fond of whatever feeling or humor I was giving off to this new kid. I asked the boy his name and he didn't respond; though he did start to laugh again. It was my voice that he was laughing at. Everything I did caused him to become hysterical. I found out later that he was from @LOCATION and didn't speak a word of @CAPS. Over the course of a month or so, I felt the hole in my heart begin to fill. My new companion and his laugh was the start to my new beginning. My mom and I eventually moved out of our house and lost contact with the neighbors. I am always reminded of him when I hear a laugh. Though he's not near me in a physical sense, I am guided by his laughter every day.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12436,20943,8,"Laughter is the best medicine Many people say laughter is the best medicine. I for one, agree. The reason why is that in many points of @CAPS life, laughter has helped me, or others, feel a whole lot better. @CAPS mother recently got surgery on her shoulder. @CAPS had medicine @CAPS all @CAPS I think the best @CAPS took was three nights ago when I was with her in her room...Doing a word-search.  It was @DATE @TIME. Every @DATE @CAPS step dad's kids come over for dinner. @CAPS mom wasn't really feeling well so @CAPS went upstairs @CAPS started on her big book of word-searches. @CAPS step-sister had recently gotten a new car so @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS step-dad were outside looking at it. I went out for @CAPS two minutes then came back inside. @CAPS step-brother was on @CAPS step-dad's iPad. He showed me this game on @CAPS @CAPS we started playing. A few minutes later @PERSON, @CAPS step dad, said that he was going to @ORGANIZATION. Katie, @CAPS step-sister, @CAPS @PERSON, @CAPS step-brother, decided to @CAPS with them. @PERSON went upstairs to ask @CAPS mom if @CAPS needed anything. Then they left @CAPS I went upstairs to check on her. I saw @CAPS was going her word-search @CAPS I started to help her.  I don't remember the name of the word-search @CAPS we did several. Since @CAPS had already started I was looking over the letters, looking for another word. Apparently I wasn't looking close enough because I swore I saw a word that wasn't even in the puzzle. So I said it @CAPS @CAPS mom said, ""@CAPS me?"" @CAPS I started laughing. I repeated myself @CAPS we were both laughing. After that wore off we finished the word-search @CAPS started a new one. This one was called ""@CAPS."" @CAPS took the book @CAPS looked over the list @CAPS suddenly said ""@CAPS-winks! Yeah!"" @CAPS I looked at her like @CAPS was crazy. Which @CAPS was. I looked at the list again @CAPS I start laughing really hard @CAPS ask, ""@CAPS's @CAPS?"" I was saying it wrong @CAPS when @CAPS were laughing that hard, who wouldn't?  ""@CAPS?"" @CAPS asked @CAPS I showed it to her. ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS."" @CAPS said @CAPS we started laughing. ""That sounds like something the @CAPS @CAPS would say."" I comment @CAPS @CAPS mom does the little song from the @CAPS @CAPS song which made me laugh harder. We barely made it through the end of the word-search. @CAPS we did. The next one I think was called ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS"" @CAPS were several things on @CAPS we didn't know. I asked her @CAPS one was @CAPS @CAPS's like, ""I don't know."" @CAPS then I asked her another. ""@CAPS're asking me all the things I don't know."" @CAPS said. This word search was kind of funny @CAPS only because we were saying the rest of the letters after the actual word which made them pretty funny. I accidentally circled the word ""ear"" because I thought it was on the list. It wasn't. @CAPS ""earring"" was. We ended up finding ""hair"" at the end of the ""ear"" I'd circled. ""@CAPS thanks for that picture."" @CAPS mom said. ""@CAPS? Ear-hair?"" I asked @CAPS we laughed again. When we finished that we went onto ""@CAPS"". That was a funny word-search. We usually read over the list of words before we look for them. One of the words was ""@CAPS"" @CAPS I laughed @CAPS said ""@CAPS yeah, I can see someone walking around with a @CAPS on their head. '@CAPS, nice @CAPS.'"" I said in a weird voice. ""'@CAPS thanks. I got it from the @CAPS store.'"" I guess I was doing a pretty good job because @CAPS mom was laughing really really hard.  ""@CAPS wouldn't that be uncomfortable? I mean it's a @CAPS. I'd think the tail would always be slapping the back of @CAPS head."" I said before laughing again. Katie @CAPS @PERSON walked in the room @CAPS looked at us like '@CAPS the heck?' @CAPS I showed her the word-search. ""@CAPS, it's not a cowboy hat. It's the full cowboy."" @CAPS said, laughing as well. @CAPS mom shook her head, trying to say something. ""@CAPS, @CAPS, it's things that wear hats."" @CAPS managed to get out @CAPS I'm looking at her. ""@CAPS kind of a hat does a @CAPS wear?"" I asked, smirking. @CAPS shook her head. ""I don't know."" @CAPS said like @CAPS was giving up. Katie @CAPS @PERSON then said good-bye @CAPS left. ""@CAPS, @CAPS more. I need to take @CAPS pills."" I snorted at @CAPS @CAPS said. ""@CAPS, @CAPS really don't need any pills."" @CAPS looks at me like @CAPS was going to punch me. @CAPS might have if I wasn't standing a few feet away. ""@CAPS away."" @CAPS said with a smile. ""@CAPS."" I said before turning @CAPS walking back to @CAPS room. I've had several things like this happen. All of them were really funny. They were the humor that @CAPS kind of had to be @CAPS to understand. I still said laughter is the best medicine. Mom says its @CAPS.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

So I walk out of my room, ask my mom if we have any plans. She says that we don't have any plans. So after I talked to her some more. I went back into my room and there I saw that I had gotten a text message from my @CAPS friend @PERSON. He asked if I wanted hang out with him. I decided of course I can because I had no family plans. ""I would love to hang out with you @PERSON"".  @PERSON and I met at the @NUM bus stop on royal and we went to @ORGANIZATION. See now the reason why we went to @ORGANIZATION was because the @CAPS before I had gotten a gift card from my grandmother and fifty dollars from @CAPS (@CAPS is my biological father). When we finally got to @ORGANIZATION asked me what are we going to get here. I said anything I want. him start busting up laughing. I bot a jackass shirt and some food. From @ORGANIZATION we went to @CAPS @CAPS to get some delicious food.  When we walked into the restaurant, the aroma from the place made us drool a little bit. @PERSON got a big bowl and stuffed @CAPS with everything he could. We ate so much. I ganged like ten pounds. We talked about life and how awesome the food was. Where we were going next was still undecided. We finally finished our food. I payed for the to bowls of food and we went to our bus stop and went to downtown @PERSON. While we were on the bus @PERSON decided that we shall go to @ORGANIZATION.  So we got off the bus and what do you know my friends @CAPS boy, @CAPS, @CAPS, @PERSON, and @PERSON were downtown chill en like a villain. @PERSON went and smoked a cigarette. While I went and checked the bus schedule for the @ORGANIZATION bus. Him and I had to wait for @NUM minutes. So we gust hung out with our friends. @CAPS is the funniest guy @CAPS. I laughed until I started to cry. I almost pissed myself.  We left to go get on the bus, laughed some more. When we got to the @ORGANIZATION we had know idea why we even went there. So we just walked around. @PERSON decided that we should into the photo booth to make this @CAPS legit. I had a lot of fun getting our picture taken. Next place we went was @CAPS-topic. I love that store. We were in there for @CAPS.  About two or so hours pass.  At the @ORGANIZATION there is this park that you can go to but you have to cross the bridge to get to @CAPS. @PERSON and I got bored and went on an epic adventure to this park. There was a couple trails that we walked. I tripped on a branch. @PERSON laughed at me. We found this piece of concrete. @PERSON and I put on some music and danced to @CAPS @CAPS. I love @CAPS music its really fun to dance to. I had orange soda that @PERSON drank. I took a lot of pictures of him drinking the soda. We pretended that the grass was lava and the concrete was a place for break dancing in cave man days. I took a video of @PERSON dancing and laughing to the song @CAPS's the @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS by sponge bob. He also ate all of my chips that i bot at @ORGANIZATION. After that we went back onto the trails and skipped through the tree's. I trow skittles at birds and old people. While telling them to taste the rainbow.  We finally realized that we needed to get back home so him and I started walking back to the bus stop. Missed the first bus the caught the next one. Hung out downtown for an hour. Chilled with my downtown friends at @NUM park. Got a donut from @ORGANIZATION. That place is epicly bad ass! Got some intents from this cool store by the station.  As the @CAPS ended @PERSON and I went our separate ways home. Both still to this @CAPS saying that, ""that @CAPS was epic"".",16,15,0.0,31,0.0,0.0,0.0,31.0

12439,20946,8," Human beings are...unusual...Okay, we're weird. There are so many people in the world, including ourselves, and the only way we can like ourselves is if we can get others to like us; if that isn't strange enough, we still don't like ourselves no matter who likes us. Just what are we thinking? We are always using relationships to assist our understanding of who we are; it's a gamble to even have those relationships. Face the facts, we risk so much on relying on others; we give them the ability to build us...or break us. Our major goals as youngsters is to find people to like us. I think it might even span to later times in life than that! From my experiences I know there are two key points in knowing a person can build us: trust and kindness. Finding builders with these traits is as easy as understanding if they bring you joy or not.  A person can give you joy by simply being kind to you...but if you want a whole swarm of friends, then this isn't exactly the best way. It's not that kindness is a bad way to make friends...it's just that it's not the fastest method. If a builder is kind then of course you would become their friend...in time; in order to immediately know a friend when you see one, they will make you laugh. Laughter makes us enjoy our time with our friends, it's a golden rule in the book of @CAPS, if there is such a book. And it was through laughter that I made my experience in @CAPS class better. @CAPS class, to me, was extremely stressful. Every day we had either a speaking assignment or we had paperwork; and the class was really slow. Why was it slow? It was slow because we could hardly get through one set of instructions without some group speaking or finding some other way to disturb the class. A good example would be this one class project we had to do. As usual, instructions were slow; I was at my boiling point. Today seemed different though, despite the the usual annoyance, not a single student asked for a repeat on instructions, in fact, they all seemed to understand and immediately started working. I too followed in with this action. The assignment was, each group of about three to four people had to create a script using the vocabulary learned from the supplied booklet; it took a whole class period and then everyone went home to do their other work. The next day we returned to @CAPS was definitely an interesting one. The teacher had all kinds of strange props lined up for us. apparently we were going to have the audience act out our script, our job was to read it out loud. My group was first to entertain and we had finally selected our volunteers and actors. Tiffany, @PERSON, and I sat down in the back of the classroom ready to read the script, not sure what the actors would deliver. Our play was... a success?! By the end of the first sentence everyone was giggling. As we moved further on to the next play the laughter had grew louder. Students were really enjoying themselves and more people volunteered to preform until it was difficult to choose actors. Even I, the classroom-snob, was enjoying myself. The plays were fun and random, some play would send everyone into hysterics. I can easily remember one of the groups making me laugh so hard that my sides were aching, tears lined my lids, and it was almost impossible to breathe. This project was definitely the best one I had ever participated in. It's moments like these when we build strong unity in the classroom, we enjoyed all of the people around us and we enjoyed ourselves. I was so use to being angery at my classmates that I was taken by suprise on that one day. Enjoying their plays so much, I now look at them as an entertaining group of students, rather that the annoyance I had seen them as before. No longer are these people strangers in the hallway, now they are family. It really is amazing how something as simple as laughter can change ones outlook on others and themselves.",20,23,0.0,43,0.0,0.0,0.0,43.0

Laughter brings out a sense of @CAPS closer to someone, a sense of humor, a friendship, and a positive environment. Personally, I feel as if the world would be a miserable place to be without laughter. I can assure @CAPS life would not be the same as it is @CAPS. Without laughter, @CAPS @DATE vacation would not have been anything like it was. Over @DATE vacation @CAPS friends and I made it our mission to embarrass @PERSON (@PERSON). This however, was not as easy as it @MONTH sound, seeing as how nothing could ever bring her down. We tried out hardest to embarrass her, but nothing was working. We tried throwing her into a pool while her crush was around, dumping our drinks all over her just as a group of cute boys walked by, calling her names that only a grandmother would call a child. @CAPS name it, we did it. @CAPS was like a brick of marble, extremely hard to break. One day, @CAPS closet friend @PERSON came up with the idea of grabbing a pair of shorts, removing the seem on the butt, and gluing it back together in hopes of it ripping when @PERSON bent over.  ""@CAPS @PERSON,"" I began, ""@PERSON and I found these shorts @TIME, and thought that @CAPS might like them. They're super cute, and would go perfect with your new yellow tank top."" ""@CAPS! Thanks guys, they fit great!"" @PERSON screamed as @CAPS filled with excitement. ""@CAPS let's go to the mall!"" @CAPS about an hour or so of walking around the mall, I threw @CAPS phone down and acted as if I hadn't noticed. However, @PERSON freaked out and ran @CAPS it as it slid down the walk way. Just as @CAPS was about to bend over and grab i,t her crush, @PERSON walked right behind her. Next thing @CAPS know, her shorts were split right down the middle, and her cheeks were bright red. @PERSON and I couldn't help but laugh. The look on @CAPS face was priceless. I wish I had had @CAPS camera.  We had never seen @PERSON so mad. @CAPS was absolutely fuming, yet @PERSON and I were still @CAPS @CAPS her. I mean, who wouldn't laugh @CAPS someones pants splitting in front of a huge crowd of people @CAPS the mall?  ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS,"" @CAPS screamed. ""@PERSON saw @CAPS, and @CAPS're @CAPS? He's never going to talk to @CAPS again. I hate @CAPS guys!""  ""@CAPS don't hate us. That was hysterical and @CAPS know it,"" chimed @PERSON. ""@CAPS like we embarrassed @CAPS pretty good, huh?"" ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS! @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS! @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS! We broke the rock. We actually broke the rock,"" I giggled as @PERSON and I gave each other a high-five. A few minutes later @PERSON began to crack up @CAPS, and apologized for freaking out @CAPS realizing that it was all in good fun. Little did we know, @CAPS was planning to get us back. By the end of @DATE break we had been to nearly every party, but there was still one to @NUM and @ORGANIZATION. We all had a gut @CAPS that this was going to be the best one yet.  Everyone was having a blast @CAPS @ORGANIZATION and @ORGANIZATION's party. The strobe lights were going, there was crazy, loud music, the hot tub was @CAPS the perfect temperature, and there was a bunch of people in the pool. Who could complain? Just as the party was about to come to a halt, @PERSON decided to undo @CAPS bikini top, and pull @CAPS bikini bottoms down! Humiliated, both of us ran in @LOCATION's room, and locked the door. How could @CAPS take it this far? Was our practical joke this embarrassing to her? Tired of all the nagging coming from @LOCATION and @PERSON about us running away, we decided to leave the room and forget what happened. Let's just say that we know what we did to @PERSON was wrong, we wont do it again, and we @CAPS know not to mess with her to the extent that we had during our mall trip. Honestly, I feel as if this whole experience brought us closer to together. If that didn't ruin our friendship, nothing would. Consequently, @CAPS can @CAPS see why I feel that laughter is an important part of a friendship and/or relationship. It makes the world go round. Do @CAPS have any experiences @CAPS laughter brought @CAPS and a friend, significant other, or family member closer together?    ",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12441,20948,8," During the @CAPS break my family went to @LOCATION except for my older brother. We were head to @LOCATION, @LOCATION. The ride there was long but we made it. When I woke up at my grandparents house there was already snow! I was very excited. They got about six to eight inches of snow. We rested before we went out to enjoy the snow. Later while I was outside I got a visit from old friends of mine. I hadn't seen them since @DATE. We talked and hung out. They told me that I was lucky to get out of school early for @CAPS break. They still had to got to school. I told them that if they're lucky then they would have to go to school for only half of the week. And they did get lucky. @DATE they went to school and the rest of the week they got off because the roads were icy. I was very happy that they got the rest of the week off, now we were able to actually hang out during the break. That night my grandma made us some barbeque chiken, scalloped potatoes, green beans and corn, and rolls. It was really good. I love my grandmas cooking and she's the head chef at the school that she works at. She is an amazing cook! @DATE was a very cold day. My friends invited me to go shoot air soft guns. It would me my first time. Being with my friends again was fun. While I was trying to shoot an air soft gun, my friend @PERSON told me that I was shooting it wrong. ""@CAPS am I shooting it wrong?"" I asked him. He told me that he didn't really know and that I suck at shooting. I reminded him that it was my first time. Then he put his arms around me to try to help me aim better. It was very awkward but I was a little frustrated. Sometimes I hate it when people try to help me when I don't want it. And that was one of the time. But he was one of my good friends so it wasn't too bad. When we were done, @PERSON asked my to hold onto his air soft gun while he was getting something. He had also told me that the safety was on. So while I was waiting, I was spinning the gun on one of my fingers and somehow I shot him in the back. He freaked out a little bit and asked why I shot him.  ""I didn't mean too. I was spinning the gun on my finger and somehow I shot you! Pluse you said that the safety was on!"" @PERSON forgave me and told me that it wasn't my fault because it wasn't. He saw that our friends @NUM, @PERSON, @LOCATION, @PERSON were laughing and so was my cousin @PERSON. @CAPS confesed that he was the one that shot @PERSON in the back. So @PERSON decide that he was going to shoot @CAPS back. Then somehow it beacame an all out shooting between all of us. I had lots of fun that day. It's one of my favorite memories when I was there. While I was still in @LOCATION, my @CAPS @DATE asked if I can babysit for her. So the next day after lunch I let my little cousin @PERSON play in the backyard after he was done eating. My baby cousin @PERSON was taking a nap so I told @PERSON that we can't be to loud. I decide to go play outside in the snow with him. After we were done we decided to go back into the house. We got locked out. Then I remembered that @TIME when my @CAPS was still home, @PERSON was messing with the lock. So I decided to go around the house and try the front door. It was locked too. @PERSON told me that the garage door can open, but he didn't know the code. I felt really stupid. After a couple minutes more we went over to one of their neighbors house so that I can call my @CAPS because I didn't have her cell phone number. But the neighbor only had their house number. Then I called my dad so that I can get her number. I told him what happend and he started to laugh. @PERSON was still taking her nap so things were still kind of ok. I called my @CAPS and we waited until she got home. She told me that it was ok and it happend to her twice while @PERSON was taking a nap. She also said that sometimes before she goes outside she takes a key with her of makes sure that the door was unlock. I learned a little lesson that day. But other than that @PERSON and I had fun outside.  I had such a great time while I was in @LOCATION. Just being in @LOCATION is one of my favorite places to be. Espicially when I'm with my friends and family.",19,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12442,20949,8,"                                  ""Laughter"" @CAPS people @MONTH actually believe that only money can buy happiness, but happiness comes from the great things in life, and the greatest thing we have is laughter. Not only does it show kindness, happiness, and freedom, it makes others and yourself feel good. Laughter is one of the best feeling we can have, although it can hurt if its too much. It can teach others a way to express themselves, and forget about the bad in life. Anyone can laugh, and anyone can make others laugh. Without laughter, life would be such a bore. But you never want to push laughter, because even laughter has a limit.  There is different ways to bring laughter in someones life, and there is different ways of being funny. There is good ways of being funny and bad ways. A bad way is being the class clown, it becomes annoying, rude, and it can get you on your teachers bad side. A good way would to tell a joke or maybe sometimes embarrassing yourself can work. It seem to be the worst, but if you laugh at yourself it can make you feel better, and you don't have to look at it as bad as you think it was. I know that I can be funny at times, and sometimes I make myself laugh, but it is never good to laugh at someone and make them feel bad. Making another feel bad can make you look bad, and others @MONTH not think of you as funny. You never want to put another down, people have feelings, and hurting someone only makes you look like the bad guy.   @CAPS people think that happiness is in fairy tales, also love, but when you really want happiness than turn to your friends and make them laugh. Getting another to laugh feels great, and it helps build up confidence and character. Having confidence and character really helps you in life, it brings more joy, love, and others @MONTH think about you in a better way. It can bring people together and it can bring peace. You don't have to try to be funny to make someone laugh, sometimes laughter just appears for no reason at all.    Laughter could be an open way to win another heart. Being a bore can make you seem like your not an interesting person or not really all that fun. When people fall in love they find someone to share their life with. Sharing laughter could help your relationship and make it stronger. All we really need in life is happiness and success, and with happiness and success comes laughter. I can also help you meet new and interesting people, @CAPS you more and more friends in your life! With laughter, you really find the good part in life. There is many adventures that life will take you through.  I love to laugh, it makes me feel better when I'm upset. Laughing makes me feel good on the inside and out. I also love to make others laugh. For example, how I met my best friend @CAPS. She was upset and she felt like nothing in the world was going right, I knew that she wasn't happy and I didn't want her to feel like that. So as a friend I helped her out and made her laugh at all the bad things and forget about them. Ever since then we've been best friends and she has never felt like that again. Laughter really is a great thing to have, it brings happiness to us all. And getting others to laugh makes you more of an interesting person, being an interesting person makes life easier and more stress free.  Sharing this amazing feeling is great and can make your life more stress free. Stress can slow you down, along with sadness. When I'm down, I like to make myself laugh. Sometimes just the little things in life are the greatest things in life. In my opinion, I think that laughter is the greatest feeling you can give someone. Finding something that is just as great, is like finding a meaning in life. No one really knows the meaning of life, and we'll never know, but having the ability to laugh and make others laugh is a part of life, and a privilege. So go out and tell a joke or two, just make someone laugh and feel good.",16,20,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12443,20953,8," A while back, I had a friend named @PERSON. We were best friends; like two peas in a pod. We would hang out everyday, all day @DATE.  One random day we walked up to our other friend @PERSON's house to see if she could hang out. We all were hanging out all day when @PERSON came up with an idea. She wanted both me and @PERSON to stay the @TIME.We stayed out a little past dark and just walked around @CAPS. We stopped at @LOCATION's house so she could get her clothes then left to go back to @ORGANIZATION. On our way there, we stopped, again, at @LOCATION's house and chilled for a while. We were there for @CAPS @NUM minutes just laughing @CAPS all the crazy stuff that has happened over @DATE already! When we were finally giving hugs to go to @CAPS's, @CAPS, @LOCATION's older brother, smacked @PERSON on her butt and told her it was nice. We made fun of her for the longest time for that! Not to mention how @CAPS kept talking @CAPS that until he moved to @ORGANIZATION.  When we left, @LOCATION, @PERSON and I were singing to @ORGANIZATION's new @CAPS when some random person stopped and asked for directions. Then I directed him to where he was going and he said, ""@CAPS you,"" and drove away. When he had gone, @PERSON looked at me and screamed, ""That was the hottest guy I have @CAPS seen!"" @CAPS @CAPS the time we reached the @CAPS down the road we saw the guy again. @CAPS this time he wasn't so hot. He had a scruffy face and long, brown, straggly hair tied in a ponytail and was dressed like a hobo. I, still to this day, give her crap @CAPS it. That was the greatest @TIME of @DATE.  We ended up going to the @CAPS @CAPS to buy some drinks when @PERSON started freaking out @CAPS losing her @CAPS. So we all had to retrace our steps all the way back to @LOCATION's house, hoping we'd find it. Re-retracing our steps, we came across this guy who tried to help us find it. By then it was probably @CAPS @NUM @CAPS'clock @LOCATION. We finally gave up and decided to head back to @ORGANIZATION. Before We even stepped foot in her front door, her mom comes darting out and starts screaming at @LOCATION. So her mom took me and @PERSON back to my house @CAPS by the time I knocked on the door, because it was locked, and everyone was asleep so we had no where to go. So for that @TIME @PERSON and I were stuck homeless. We walked around all @TIME. Almost fell asleep in the laundromat when i remembered that my aunt @PERSON was looking at a small, white truck for sale in the @CAPS parking lot. The truck had a bed in the back, no, i don't know why, and it sounded better than the hard floor of the laundromat so we crawled in.  It was a tight squeeze, @CAPS we managed. Plus it wreaked of dirty socks and pee. It was, for sure, the worst thing 've @CAPS smelled. @CAPS no doubt was it the funnest @TIME I've had with that girl.",16,15,0.0,31,0.0,0.0,0.0,31.0

12445,20955,8," Everyone laughs differently , some people laugh so hard that they cry, and some don't. But one thing that they have in common is laughter. People use laughter as a way to express their feelings of joy, or happiness, or even if something is just really funny to them. Laughing is a great way to feel happier about something for instance maybe you are having a bad day and then one of your friends comes up to you and tells you a funny joke. It makes you feel better, right? Having a good sense of humor is something that can help you get through tough situations, embarrassing things, or even like I said just a bad day. Being able to laugh at yourself and even something that you might have done that was embarrassing is a good thing, it can help you get over it and not be so embarrassed about it. Whenever I laugh I always feel better, laughing reminds me of all the good things in life. Laughing reminds me of good times I have spent with friends and family, it reminds me of all the inside jokes my friends and I have come up with over the years and that we can still laugh at just as hard as we used to. I believe that laughing is enjoyable for everyone it can make you feel better no matter what and some people even say that laughing makes you younger. When you laugh at things it creates long lasting memories that you will never forget and when you talk about them again in the future you will still think it is just as funny as before. Some of my best friends laugh at everything, they think that every little joke is the funniest ever, their laughs are unforgettable you can always hear them laughing. Which in another way shows how laughter can make anyone happy. If you believe that you are not a funny person, just say something to one of them and I can guarantee that they will laugh at it and you will feel funny and most likely start laughing as well.  I enjoy getting to spend quality time with some of my closest friends, and probably the best time I had with them was when we went to @ORGANIZATION for the beginning of @DATE before going into high school. It was two days after our promotion (graduation) from middle school. We packed up my family's car and headed out for @ORGANIZATION. Not even half-an-hour into the car ride and we are already cracking up laughing at every little thing going on. We always create great memories and this one was already in the books for one of the best. I am sure that the car ride for my mom and aunt was just as fun, we sang songs and danced (as much as we could buckled down in a seat) to as many songs as we could fit in those two hours. Of course during the car ride we got stopped by construction so we decided to jump out of the car and do a @CAPS fire drill around it. All the others cars watched and laughed at us even the construction workers though it was funny. We made a boring moment fun. Once we finally got there we did not hesitate to drop off our bags and grab our bikes and take off and explore. The weather was so nice, not a cloud in the sky. During our exploration bike ride we laughed, told jokes, and just talked about how excited we were to be out of middle school and moving on to high school. The next day we decided that we wanted to float down the river on a raft, sounds like a fun idea. Well it would be if we actually knew where we were going, I used to do it all the time with my family so I had an idea of where to go, but still five girls two rafts and a river, maybe not such a good idea. During the whole river raft trip we jumped back and forth between the two rafts occasionally splashing each other with the oars. Knowing us we laughed the whole way down the river. Whenever we passed people I'm sure they thought something was wrong with us by how much we were laughing and enjoying each others company. By the time we finished the rafting trip we were hungry good thing my mom had prepared us some lunch for when we got home, when we sat down at the table we could never keep a straight face. What made it even funnier was that my aunt and my mom didn't know what we were laughing at because we could just look at each other and laugh. You know you have built a good friendship when you can just look at each other and laugh, already knowing what your friend is thinking because of all the inside jokes you have with each other. All because of one little thing called laughter.                                     ",18,22,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12446,20956,8,"Laughter can be used for many things. One of which can be the important part of a relationship. There are many key parts in a relationship. But, the most important one is definitely the part of ""laughter being the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS laughter can cure the emotion of being sad. @CAPS it doesn't cure it.   If laughter is the shortest distance between two people then if a guy or girl meets someone they like. For instance, I have went up to a girl before and couldn't figure out anything to do or say. So, I just tried my best to make her laugh. It @MONTH have taken a few days of trying really hard to do so. But, in the the end, i was more comfortable asking her out and feeling more comfortable around her and her friends. @CAPS I can make her laugh I always feel better about myself because it is never a good thing to see her in a bad mood. Now on some occasions I have made people laugh and it not mean anything. But, @CAPS I make my girl laugh then it was totally worth it. Because I can cheer her up from being any kind of sad or angry to making her happy and full of laughter. It @CAPS helps with being depressed too. Her being depressed is kinda like a train wrecking off its tracks. It never turns out good. But @CAPS she is happy, she can be full of joy, all giddy, and @CAPS very spontaneous.  I know @CAPS being alone and laughing is good. But you can @CAPS get called crazy if you are laughing at nothing at all. The best way to know someone is possibly feeling better is laughter. If they laugh then they can't be mad, sad, or any kind of emotion besides happy, or maybe sarcasm. But sarcasm can be blown off like it is nothing. If I ever try sarcasm to make people laugh I always end up offending them. So I always just be myself around everyone I come around.  So if you ever hear that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. You should know that it is true. Because not only do you get to a lot more place and get to know someone more. But, you can also learn valuable things about life through being closer to more people. @CAPS you hear that phrase, ask yourself, ""@CAPS I capable of making someone laugh? @CAPS I able to pull off laughter and actually be close to someone?"" @CAPS you do that, you'll know that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.",18,18,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12447,20957,8," Each person filed in, one after the other, making a human train. The metallic red bell chimed once as each person pushed the door slightly more open. Walking in, I was enveloped by the smell of @CAPS food and conversations that hummed in my ears. I took a few steps forward and stopped, not knowing where to go. To the right was a wall covered in @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS symbols and meanings, while to the left were hundreds of tables already filled. Not knowing where to take my place, I turned to my mom. I so badly wanted to plop myself down at one of the adult tables, even if it meant I had to sit there silently. With moms knowing what's best, she shoved me towards the back of the restaurant, telling me to go sit with my cousins. I did as she told me, like always, but made my reluctance clear. Walking over to the table with the speed of a slug and my feet dragging on the floor, I awkwardly stood in front of the circular table. Yanking out one of the chairs, I turned to my mom with a pleading look as desperation filled every fiber of my body, for I knew there was no way she would give in. Staring at these six relatives, I didn't know how I could manage to sit here the rest of the evening.  We had all gathered at a @CAPS restaurant for my grandpa's @NUM birthday. Each of his children had flown from the mainland to @LOCATION in order to spend this special moment with him. I hadn't seen these cousins for over @NUM years, and some much longer. I had already visited with them since we'd been in @LOCATION, but I hadn't talked to them much, none the less when we were all together and forced to mingle.  With my napkin on my lap, I sat and looked at my cousins, each one staring back at me like I was an animal at the zoo. After a moment or two, they seemed to forget I was there because they averted their gaze and began talking amongst themselves. The only person at the table who I didn't feel like a complete stranger towards was my cousin, @PERSON. She had wavy brown hair with blindingly blond highlights, sun-kissed from those bright tropical days, along with that brown @CAPS skin that made me jealous. We began talking, and soon I found myself enjoying the moment.  It wasn't until the food came that we actually began interacting as a group. Being teenagers with bland palates, everyone stared as the waiter brought the first dish. After asking the friendly waitress what it was we were about to eat, from her broken @CAPS we deciphered that they were buns with duck inside. Frantically trying to get all of the tables served in fairly constant intervals, she left our table and all of us looked at our food blankly. No one wanted to take the first bite. One of my cousins, @PERSON, stepped up to take the masculine role as the dare devil. We all waited tentatively as he chomped down on the moist bun and swallowed. Once done chewing, he smiled and it seemed this dish had won his approval. Digging into my buns, I began to wonder if maybe these people were easy to relate to and I had made a small thing into a big ordea. From then on, I would just be myself and stop worrying about not having seen anybody for years; All I needed was to be myself.  The way the courses were set up left plenty of time to chat between each plate they brought. Since I was no longer worrying about what to say or how to say it, I easily fit into the conversations and began to relax. Shortly after the duck tray was removed from the table, it was discovered that my cousin @PERSON, who is from @LOCATION, pronounces certain words with an accent. Soon everybody began comparing the way we pronounce things to the way that he does. After each difference we found, we would chuckle. Things carried on like that for the rest of the @TIME, everyone laughing at things that were only moderately funny, but we found hilarious.  It was that @TIME when I realized, even though you @MONTH be uncomfortable around a group of people who you don't know very well, finding a common ground helps you to ease that discomfort. Finding something that you all enjoy talking about @MONTH be hard to do, but finding something that makes you laugh is a lot easier. Laughter is something that everyone enjoys and can take part in even if they're not contributing to the conversation. By feeling as though you're a part of what's going on, you feel accepted, and that's all anyone ever wants.",20,25,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12448,20958,8," People say laughter is the shortest distance between two people. A @ORGANIZATION I saw @CAPS to be true was when I met a girl named @PERSON. Three years ago I was at a city @CAPS swinging, wondering if it would hurt if I jumped. I took @CAPS chances and let go of the swing chains, flying through the air , noticing the unbalanced feeling of falling in @CAPS chest, everything slowing down, the temptation of what will happen when I hit the ground was vast. Sticking the landing was a fail and getting up from it wasn't much of a success either, until I felt hands upon @CAPS shoulder and arm. I looked up at @CAPS helper and saw a girl. Not @CAPS a girl but a gorgeous girl. A girl with green dazzling eyes that can stop an angry rhino charging toward her, hair the flowed with the wind, soft, gentle skin that would make you think that @CAPS could be hurt for how soft it was.""@CAPS."" Was all I could squeeze out.""@CAPS, are you okay?"" @CAPS asked with a very concerned tone.""@CAPS I'm fine, @CAPS forgot to stick the landing. Thanks for helping me, um whats your name?"" I returned with a @NUM, and your welcome. whats your name?"" @CAPS @ORGANIZATION @CAPS giggled before @CAPS said her name.""@CAPS, do you want to walk around with me?"" I struggled to vocalize.""@CAPS, but I have to @CAPS at the @CAPS because @CAPS mom will be here soon."" @PERSON stated. during the walk around the @CAPS we stopped at a monkey dome and started asking each other random question's that the other person had to answer. I figured out that @CAPS was @NUM years old, her favorite color was baby blue and @CAPS always wanted to be a doctor. we walked around the playground some more @CAPS talking about past memories or something that happened to each other in the past. I asked her if @CAPS had a brother and sister. her response was that @CAPS does have a brother, and two sisters. While I was listening to her I noticed @CAPS was very deep into thought and asked what @CAPS was thinking about and @CAPS quickly replied. ""@CAPS, @CAPS wondering why I'm so happy with you.""""well it could be that I'm making you feel good by laughter. Or it could be @CAPS charms working on you."" I replied with a @CAPS accent.""@CAPS @CAPS its definitely that."" @CAPS barely got out the words cause of laughter. Suddenly there was a car horn honking and we said our goodbye's and @CAPS left. I sat there watching the car go down the road and was hoping that we @MONTH see each other again, but in a way I knew we wouldnt because @CAPS mom, and I were moving from the city to a small town half way across the country. Turning around and walking back toward @CAPS house for the last night in the city all I could think about was her and how a little bit of laughter became the @CAPS to friendship.",17,18,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12449,20959,8," When a day is qualified as perfect there are a lot of things that go into making it so. Most perfect days in people's teenage years are in the @DATE beyond the stress of school. My perfect day wasn't in the @DATE, nor was it on a crazy @DATE break in @LOCATION. My perfect day was on a @DATE in the middle of @MONTH in @DATE. It was on this perfect day that my friendship with @ORGANIZATION was founded. A friendship that is now the best one of all. A friendship that is based on fun times, memories, story telling, and laughter. By @DATE I had spent multiple weekends with @ORGANIZATION. However none were as hot as that weekend in late @DATE. We decided we needed to cool off and with that said, we set off for @CAPS. Down the road we went with two redneck boys and a mutt in the truck bed. Arriving in @CAPS was peculiar because I was so far out of my comfort zone. It was also peculiar because I hadn't met a single soul @ORGANIZATION was about to introduce me to. When I first lay my eyes on @PERSON, @PERSON, @PERSON, and @PERSON I couldn't fathom how @ORGANIZATION had met them. She is athletic, driven, proper, and intelligent. The boys that shook my hand were into things like big trucks, fishing poles, and a loud country band. I didn't think upon first meeting them that opposites could attract or become fond of one another. As the day progressed I found my comfort zone again. As the hours flew by and jokes and laughs were exchanged, I realized just how similar we all really were. I didn't think that all of the childish things we did that @DATE in @MONTH would matter to me months down the roads, but they do. When we were running by the dirty creek with black lipstick painted on as war paint and laughing so hard we cried, I realized just how perfect the situation was. If that day wouldn't have brought laughs to my lips and my mind to it's comfort zone, it would have been a day long forgotten. If you go back on every happy memory you have, there is always one common ground. A joke, or even a funny face makes you laugh extremely hard. Every time I drive through @CAPS I think about the day when the sun was hot and we sat by fishing poles exchanging laughs. I think about @ORGANIZATION and I running through the trees laughing and tripping over our own feet. I think about @PERSON and @PERSON laughing and pointing as we attempted to go swimming.  After all of the crazy running and swimming we were quite wound up. @PERSON, @PERSON, and @PERSON asked us to take a walk; so we accepted and off we went into the brush. Within five minutes of our departure, we stopped walking. Our walk had put us on the top of a hill of little round pebbles. I'm not sure what events lead up to @LOCATION pushing @PERSON down the hill. However, I remember @PERSON pulling @PERSON down with him. I also recall @PERSON sliding down to join the battle. Watching three boys wrestle and play on a hill of sliding rocks was something like watching a movie about the fifties. Nobody was texting or messing with a machine. Around us was laughing and serenity which danced like music around us. The day had no stress and it had the perfect amount of sunshine. It was like something you only dream about. Once you are in a moment like that, where your own little world is pulling you closer, you never want to leave it. When your on the laughing high, you disconnect yourself and for a few brief seconds your life is in it's simplest form. You are simply you, no racing thoughts, no rushing emotions. You are just one person. I never thought that something as small as laughs could create or better a friendship. On that @DATE I realized that the laughs shared between @ORGANIZATION and I would be the first memory for what was to come. Every event and every laugh that we had that day will be something I think about when I'm doubtful of the world. It'll always be a memory that makes me appreciate living. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS that @DATE I wouldn't have believed it but laughing made me closer with people I would have otherwise avoided. Laughs and smiles bounded my world into @ORGANIZATION and into the world of a few @CAPS rednecks. And as of a @DATE @TIME, that has made all the difference.",20,25,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12450,20962,8," Moving around from place to place was always hard, I hated the thought of never seeing any friends or family. Never was the only word I could hold on to, there was no point in hope it was a futile feeling. I knew I would dearly miss @LOCATION, and @ORGANIZATION just sounded so far; a twelve hour drive seemed like the edge of the earth to me. I visited @ORGANIZATION before, it was boring to tell the truth, and on top of that looking for a new house would bore me furthermore, all I could think about was @LOCATION. Now I was moving there! When I first heard about the move I was infuriated and tried to fight against this poor decision, I was sure that my parents were making a mistake. As hard as I fought I could not win, my tears coulden't move my parents in the slightest way even In my greatest efforts, I was broken and confined to the moving van for twelve hours but to me it felt like forever. Finally my departure was over and my legs were sore and tired, I didn't want to manouver out of my seat or even touch @ORGANIZATION's soil. The ground was dirty and tainted and the apartment complex was old and overly occupied, the rain and mud didn't help my attitude much either. Everything about this place was digusting and the thought of still sharing a room with my younger brother made me feel sick to my stomach. I stepped foot out side and entered my apartment and went straight to my bleakly colored room. I sat down and collected my thoughts trying to determine the pros and cons of my situation. The walls were caving in on me and they seemed to take the shape of bars, I was condemed to this fait that I could not escape untill I turned @NUM, and that was more than @NUM years away! I was stuck in my apartment for three days before I wandered outside, but it wasn't all that horrible concidering it was raining all the time even at the end of the @DATE which was abnormal for me. I didn't want to leave my room or my apartment, all I wanted to do is watch @DATE @TIME cartoons in my room. I felt alone and out of place I had no friends to talk to, my parents wouldent listen to me, and my little brother was only @NUM so he wouldent understand. There were no more smiles when I found out that I had to go to school the next day. Aloha park sounded like some school that would have great funding and spoiled rich kids in it but it was actually the exact opposite. It was an older school with kids that mostly lived in lower income housing at the time. In someways it was rather comforting knowing that I lived the same way temporarily. The first day of school was frightening, it was my first major transition into a new unfamilliar place. My teacher was old and grouchy, she seemed to have a major chip on her shoulder. Suddenly, out of the blue she held my hand in the hallway which was humilliating and definately not comforting. I heard my new classmates giggle and laugh when they saw me I thought I would never make any friends. The humiliation was withstandable but the thought of being in this class for the next nine months was a fear beyond belief. My teacher told me to take a seat on the far side of the room next to three boys, they all had the same expression which was an amalgamation of both alienated confusion and territorial pride. The feeling of being unwelcome would be an understament of the new nervous sensation that had surrounded me. I sat down unaware of the actions that the three boys might deal on to me, surprisingly the only occurence was a series of temporary stares and an aquard silence.  As the day continued life had again had become somewhat casual, until the boys had started to talk about the opposite gender and my attention was directly turned towards them. I sat there and quietly listened and smirked at the inapropriate conversation that I was clearly not supposed to be a part of. They laughed and snickerd and covered their mouths embarassingly, as I looked at them and concidered them amatures of the comical arts. I wanted to say something that I held onto for the whole conversation and then I took my chances to add a most important joke and quickly I muttered my overly inapropriate sentence. They confusingly looked at me and asked me what I had said, I wasnt sure how they would take the joke but I risked another chance and repeated it. The group of boys grew silent and the only noises were those of the other students talking to eachother, suddenly they bursted out laughing. I was overjoyed that they had a sense of humor, and after that I had friends and @CAPS.    ",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12451,20963,8,"                 Laughter at its @CAPS  Laughter is one ability that everyone in the world has. Not only does it help you make more friends, but it can also turn your day all the way around. The capability to laugh is a huge importance in this world. Without laughter, days would be dull, sad, and somewhat depressing. When I see someone laugh, it brightens my day, makes me smile, and causes me to laugh along with them. By laughing we become happier, learn more about others, and make our bad days better. I have experienced, first hand, the joys laughing can bring after I have had a bad moment, and that is why I believe that laughter is extremely important to have and to keep in your life.  Not everyone can have a great day all the time. Bad days occur, and when they do, seeing one funny incident and laughing about it is what can turn the whole day around and make it great. Many people hear the statement, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" or a statement similar to that one and will never agree with it. Often times we will scoff and disagree completely. It turns out that I used to be one of those people myself. Most days were not the @CAPS they could be, plus having to go to school all day long ruined it a little more. People kept telling me that if I laughed once in a while then I might feel better more often, and I @MONTH actually have fun when I participated throughout the day. I never believed them, and why should I? How could one action as simple as laughing change the way I feel about everyday life? The possibilities were just to unlikely. I didn't think I'd change my views on it either, until a few years ago.  It started off like any usual day would, not so great. My hair was a mess, my sister @PERSON and I could not stop fighting, and my brand new phone broke right as we started our shopping trip to @LOCATION. I had decided that the day was going to be horrible because so far, nothing had worked out well. As the day went on, nothing worse happened, but nothing better did either. @PERSON and I kept traveling around, going to stores, and shopping. Finally, at our last stop we saw a situation occur. As we were sitting at a stop light, waiting for traffic to move, I spotted a strange man sitting across the road all by himself. The man looked as though he had an injury on his foot, and our suspicions were confirmed when he began walking like a hurt penguin would, barely shuffling his feet and bobbing up and down as he moved forward. The sight of this man made me smile, and when I pointed him out to @PERSON she started laughing uncontrollably. Then I too, began cracking up. The man with his crazy way of walking had made me laugh had proceeded to turn my entire day around. What I thought was impossible turned out to be the exact opposite, possible. Laughing could bring you closer to others and make your day more amazing.  As a result of my trip with my sister that day, my views and beliefs about laughing were changed greatly. Laughter actually was the shortest distance between two people. Even though my little sister and I were arguing before the funny man came, after we were done laughing about him we realized that in the span of a few minutes we had become closer than ever before. It is crazy to think that one incident can change your mind about some of your strong beliefs, but it happened, and that day is now a memory that I am going to keep with me forever. I'm happy it happened because as a result of it I have begun to think differently about laughter and the effect it can have on certain situations in my life. I now think of laughter as one of the greatest pastimes to have and do it quite often.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12452,20964,8," It was @DATE seventh and I had invited my two best friends, @PERSON and @PERSON, to go to my boyfriend's football game with me. It would be the first time for them to meet him since he went to a different high school than we did. Our plan was to get off the bus at my house and then my @CAPS would take us to his game later. When we arrived at the end of the lane we started walking up to my house. Then all of the sudden ""ahhhhhh, @CAPS my god!"" @PERSON and I were both screaming at the top of our lungs, ""@CAPS a... ahhhh!"". @PERSON and I had almost stepped on a dead snake that was laying in the lane. While this was going on @PERSON had no idea what the problem was or why we were screaming. We looked back at her and saw a completely puzzled look on her face which we found absolutely hilarious so we burst out laughing. She soon figured out that we had been startled by the snake and also started in ""you guys are so funny @CAPS just a dead snake"". We talked and laughed our way up to my house. @CAPS we had caught up a little and I had changed into my boyfriends #@NUM jersey, we went downstairs to eat. We sat down at the table with our bowls of chili and started eating. My @CAPS came over and put her bowl down then went back into the kitchen to get something. When she came back she had napkins and another bowl, I playfully ask her ""are you really hungry @CAPS?"" she said ""no..uh why?"" That's when the girls and I started laughing hysterically again, ""@CAPS you have two bowls you are obviously very hungry"" I giggled. She turned a little red and then said back ""well I do love chili, I can't ever seem to get enough of it"" then she laughed a little ""your probably right I should just start with one bowl.""  @CAPS we gathered the blankets for the stands we left. On our way up we made a pit stop at the famous @ORGANIZATION. I was so exited to see my boyfriend and to have my friends come along that coffee was probably not the best idea, but we stopped anyway. While we were in there waiting for our coffee we passed the time by making faces through the nearby window at people who happened to drive by. We were cracking up over the looks people gave us, some looked like @CAPS thought it was funny while others looked like @CAPS thought we had escaped from a nut house. Soon enough our drinks were ready and we headed out the door. Then as we were walking to the car some guy whistled at us. We hopped in the car and then lost it when we saw that it was some guy who was dressed up in one of those statue of liberty costumes.  We were almost at the school and I was bouncy from the caffeine and excitement mix. My @CAPS had never driven to @PERSON's school before, while my dad had only was busy that night. I was trying to keep calm while giving her directions in a very giggly manner. I started off by saying ""you go straight up here @CAPS"" the my @CAPS and the girls said ""honey you can't go straight up here"". ""yes you can"" I argued then @CAPS a while @PERSON said ""girl look you could go straight but you ain't gonna see @PERSON if you do"". I realized @CAPS were right and told my @CAPS ""don't turn, just turn right"" she got confused cause I had said the directions wrong so she turned left. I started to freak, screaming ""no no no! we have to turn around I meant right"" @CAPS all burst out laughing at me ""man calm down woman, we just have to turn around"" said @PERSON. We finally got back on track and I tried to give clear directions. I wasn't completely positive where the turn off was for his school so I told my @CAPS to go slow, when we passed it and I freaked out again. ""@CAPS @CAPS we have to turn around"" @CAPS all laughed at this and then my @CAPS said that she was testing me to see if I could be patient. We all laughed again. When we got there and hopped out to pay and get in. We got there in in time to see the guys come out of the locker room. I got another dose of excitement, @PERSON and @PERSON started to walk away so I could wave at @PERSON. I pulled on their shirts and begged them to stay because I didn't want to be the only person waiting. Then I saw him run past and before I knew it I leaped off the ground and waved frantically. I saw him smiling as he ran onto the field, my friends laughed at how I jumped and we enjoyed the game.",16,20,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0

First, of all I board on the way to outdoor @CAPS. Then they told us in which cabin we were suppose to be I had seven cabin members including myself. I brought my electronic device but the teachers told us that we couldn't bring no devices to the trip. The next day we did some activities first we ate lunch before doing any activities. The foods that we ate were pizza, pizza pockets, and hot dogs then the activities that we did were catch some fishes and put them back to the water we were just examine them the other activities that we did was hike the mountains on the way we saw deers they were eating grass I got really tired then when we came back we were getting ready to go home.

12454,20966,8,"                              The @CAPS of @CAPS is one of the most important things in life. When im with my family, we all have such a great time together that we laugh all the time at things or memories we say we remember. While we are all gathered around the table whether it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner we always have something fun to say and laugh about all the time. To begin with, during breakfast @DATE @TIME, we were all having a great time eating first thing in the @TIME, but suddenly when my sister remembers about what had happened the day before at her job, she just had to talk about it because she wanted us to know what happened so we can also laugh with her about it. She had said that there was a banana lying on the floor, when her manager went by she didn't see it and slipped right through the hall. It was impossible not to laugh about it becuase it was the manager. Well that @TIME was going by so fast just by thinking about what happened with the banana and the manager that day. Every time I would remember I would start laughing so much that I couldn't stop. It was the funniest thing she had ever told us that happened ever since she starting working. On the other hand, when it was time for lunch, I was at school and my mom called me that same day. I answered fast but not knowing the reason why she was calling. Suddenly she said ""@CAPS you will not believe what just happend, your dog just got finished taking a shower and is running around like crazy on top of the beds and coutches trying to get dried off"" I couldn't believe it and I starting laughing so hard that I had to tell my freinds that were next to me and them too starting laughing as well. I could picture in my head how funny that would be if I was there watching her run around like a crazy dog. As the day went by, all I would do is remember how funny that is for a dog to do that, that I would just start laughing all of a sudden during class at school, but even though it was something good to laugh at I had to stop laughing because everyone was just staring. Finally, when it was time for dinner, at the table that night we all told eachother about our day. Everyone had something new to say but, when my brother started to tell us about his day at school, he couldn't even talk because it was so funny what he wanted to say that he was just laughing. He stopped after a while and calmed down but not for long. He told us that during his lunch break he went to the bathroom and when he came out he noticed that all his freinds were laughing and pointing at him. He said he had no idea what was going on but when they told him that when he came out of the bathroom he had a big piece of tiolet paper stuck to his pants. I immediatley thought he would have gotten embarrased but instead he said he thought it was funny as well. My parents, my sister and I started to laugh so hard that we had even forgotten about our dinner sitting in front of us just lying their cold on the table. Laughter is one of the most important things in life. Without laughter each day, it just wouldnt be the same. Being able to laugh during the day is very important because it's like another way to have your day go by and wait for the next. We all at the end said that our day went by so fast, that it was or couldn't be true that the day was over and it was time for bed. The day of @DATE third was one of many days that was the best and that we all enojoyed and had fun laughing with eachother telling about funny things that happen to us during our day.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

12456,20968,8,"                          Laughing is the key of happiness. Is a moment that is remember by many people. You share many laughs with friends, family and sometimes strangers. When you laugh with someone it shows that you have something in common; you both think something is funny and it could build a strong relationship. For me laughing means a lot, i laugh everyday. I will not forget the time when i was really mad at my dad and then laughter fixed the problem. One night me and my dad were in my house in the kitchen and he was arguing with me about my grades. I told him I could still fix them that there was a solution. He was calling me a liar, and more anger kept on building up. He was so hard headed and I couldn't get through his thoughts. He was saying that i could not fixed what i have done: whats done is done. I was getting really mad, I wanted him to go away and i thought i was not ever going to talk to him. We had a lack of trust and i just wanted to tell him he was wrong. I knew he would have got more mad and we were gonna end up screaming at each other. It got me so mad that he couldn't listen. My dad said he wanted the best from me, and he was disappointed. I got really sad because my dad was the kind of guy that was all ways telling jokes and teasing everyone. He always made my day by making me laugh. Usually when he would get me in trouble, it would end up with a joke at the end. The jokes he made when i was sad or mad would build our relationship stronger; we would always end up laughing. Later the night we were with all my family cutting my niece's cake and me and my dad were not talking. As we were singing happy birthday i would glare at him and look down. He was looking at me as if he was all tough. Then we were all saying ""-í@CAPS le sople!"", which means blow out the candles in @CAPS. All of the sudden my uncle blows out the candle on accident and me and my dad stared at each other and laughed so hard. We were crying of laughter and we couldn't stop laughing. It felt great laughing at the same thing and sharing a moment together and putting aside our anger. My dad would try not to laugh but the more he tried the louder his laugh was. It was only me and him who stayed laughing, everyone else giggled. As it was making my dad and my relationship better it build a connection between my family and I. Its a memory that's gonna last a life time, yet it was an important part of my dad and my relationship. Although he was still upset about my grades it was all better. There was a connection between us and we could still look back and laugh about it. I don't know what it was about the night that i found the incident so funny. As it was making my relationship stronger, the distance between me and him didn't matter it was all build up on the memory. Something me and him both share, building a part of him and a part of me. Our problem wasn't fixed but it was as if it was not important, as if laughing made you change and helped us put it aside. Every laughing moment we have now is something me and him share, its now a connection. We both can laugh about the same things and share our thoughts making us stronger. Telling me that while me and him laugh about things is just putting more the negatives away and giving life more meaning. When you know you're happy is when you have a sense of humor. Also when you have those moments with others that you will never forget. The moment when you made laughing an important part of your pass. When all those funny moments become important because that's when you showed you were happy. Its even better when you laugh most of the time because your memories will be all remembered as a happy moment. I know at times i will have moments where i am not laughing, but the key is to always look at the bright side. Even though me and my dad were mad at each other its a memory that will carry on with me forever.",18,18,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12457,20971,8," @CAPS families @DATE in @LOCATION was one of exploration, but also one in which we came to regret our move from @LOCATION a little. We missed our friends, our connections, but also places. The place @CAPS brother and I came to miss second only to our farm was a @CAPS we had dubbed ""The @CAPS, @CAPS @CAPS."" The place itself was a dump. Close to a dairy farm, it reeked of cow pats mixed with cigarettes. I remember that the grass was perpetually dry, and the bridge crossing the @CAPS was continually squeaking; it was an old, covered bridge, and on its last leg. So, it wasn't so much the place we missed, but the happy memories associated with our special place. On one particularly mopey day, our father roused us from our rooms, saying that we were going to explore a new @CAPS. We knew about @CAPS's adventures; we called them ""@CAPS-ventures"" because they were truly one of a kind. Most of the time, we ended up miles away from any civilization and stuck in the car with our lunch out of reach. Even at our young ages, we had come to be wary of ""@CAPS-ventures."" @CAPS, our mother was able to rouse @CAPS brother and I, and we were soon hustled into the car. During the trip, our father was unbearably cheerful. While @CAPS brother and I were in the back of the car, pining for our nice, comfortable rooms, @CAPS father had the audacity to laugh along to the radio, and open the windows of the car to our protests. Riding with @CAPS brother and I in the back were two circular lumps of rubber that had been inflated. I would soon learn that these were called inner tubes, and could be used to drift down the @CAPS. After what seemed like hours on the road, we arrived at a place called ""@LOCATION bend."" @CAPS brother and I jumped out of the car, and were met with pristine beauty. Covered in shade, the @CAPS flowed noisily, and we could hear it although we were not that close to the @CAPS bank. The grass was green and velvety beneath our feet, and the smell of fresh water welling up from the earth was delicious. The light filtered down through the trees and had a crystalline effect on the water. @CAPS brother and I hurriedly dressed into our swimsuits, while @CAPS father began to cart our food and supplies down the the @CAPS bank where we would be spending the day. As soon as we finished dressing, @CAPS brother and I chased after him, for the day was warm and the water looked good and cool. When our hunger had been sated, it was time to pull out the inner tubes. The water was nice and fast, with some white water and a very little water fall at the end. Being a rather petite child for @CAPS age, even these small obstacles looked like the most insidious of rapids, and they made @CAPS eyes widen a little. @CAPS, I managed to steady myself, and prepared to get wet. At @DATE, I hung on to @CAPS inner tube with clutched fingers and wild eyes, but gradually, I relaxed. I let @CAPS hand drift out to causally trail behind me in the water, drawing circles as the sunlight filtered down through the trees. As the water grew faster, I began to feel apprehensive again. I drew sharp, quick breaths as the little waterfall approached me. In reality, it was only about four feet tall, but in @CAPS panicked haze, those four feet looked like twelve feet. The white water was suddenly upon me, accompanied by a large and frightful shriek I gave. Somehow, I managed to stay afloat, and @CAPS ride left me smiling. I broke into long peals of laughter, laughing away all @CAPS homesickness and heartsickness. @CAPS brother came down the waterfall, spluttering and giggling, and we laughed together. Our laughter healed us, and for the @DATE time since the move, we felt totally and completely at home.",21,25,0.0,46,0.0,0.0,0.0,46.0

You were infinitely beautiful in my eyes. We had the most fun that human beings were capable of. Every time we were together there was no thought in my mind that we were not happy together, no worry that you would ever leave. I never wanted to imagine life without you. As a child i had always had the title of the kid who smiles all the time, @CAPS when i thought of you i got this glow. Everybody saw it. they would ask, ""@CAPS have you been doing? Your so happy, I've never seen you like this before."" That, @CAPS they saw in me was the power of love. @CAPS something they did not see was @CAPS we had together.

12459,20973,8,"    Laughter is an important part of any relationship, whether the person is a relative, friend, or someone you are dating. Laughter makes you forget your worries and problems. But with a friendship based on laughter, when do you trade in the giggles for seriousness? I believe laughter is vital in a friendship. But to have a strong, healthy, relationship you also need a level of seriousness. This is the story of how I learned to balance laughter and seriousness in one of my most important relationships.    Olivia has been my best friend as long as I could remember, hanging out we laughed constantly. Laughter has always been a huge part of our friendship and always will be. But going into middle school we faced drama, boys and arguments, which we never experienced with one another. All of these small but important things to us then added up and began to make us drift apart. Our lack of sharing our feelings and instead cover it up with laughs caused us to bottle up anger towards each other. I always thought we were perfect matches for best friends because our countless inside jokes and the constant fun we would have. But our anger grew until we were ready to handle it, which we did not understand then.   We started to hang out less and less, and our daily calls became weekly. Both of us noticed a change in our friendship, but didn't know how to fix it, we apologized for fighting with each other and sympathized for our boy troubles but it wasn't the same. I missed her but the longer it went on the easier it was to not talk or hang out. Summer came around and our moms planned me to stay a week at her house while my parents were on vacation. To put it nicely I was less than thrilled, how was I suppose to stay a week there when we barely talk anymore? I knew everything would be okay but I still worried that the week would be constant fighting instead of laughs.    Finally the day came and my parents were driving me to her house. As I got there things were fine, we pretended nothing was going on and had fun, it was that way for a few days. But on the third day she broke the ice, asking what was wrong and why we don't talk anymore. That day something amazing happened, we talked about all our feelings and what was upsetting us. It was a little awkward at first but we got through it together. The fights got less and less because we knew the things that bugged each other, and everything slowly became better than it was before. That talk changed our relationship forever and I'm so glad she had spoken up when I didn't or else we wouldn't be as close as we are today.    That day was @DATE, but had a huge impact on our friendship.Ever since we got that mile stone in our friendship I knew better how to be more open with other people also. Olivia has taught me so much but this was among the more important lesson. Laughter is a huge part of any strong relationship but you also need to be able to share your feelings and be serious. Everyone needs a best friend to laugh with and I am grateful to have mine stick with me no matter what.",21,20,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0
12460,20974,8," Laughter is an important element in a relationship. It shows the chemistry in a couple, and it shows happiness within family and friends. How depressing would it be if the world had no laughter? It would be like the ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS"". The joyous sound of laughter that bonds relationships allows you to get to know someone better and show them you have a warm heart. Ideally, when a person has a warm heart, your conscience tells you, you can trust them. The talent to laugh is a good element to have when you are meeting someone new, and spending time with your family. Last @DATE, my youth group and I went on a missions trip to @ORGANIZATION, @LOCATION. We would be reaching out to many new children as we held a @ORGANIZATION for a week in the small @CAPS town. We picked up the children from their houses and drove them to the @ORGANIZATION to play games and sing songs. As we met each child one by one, it was important to give them a warm smile and laugh with them. If we had come into their neighborhood with our straight serious faces in our big twelve passenger white vans, it would send out a different message to the children. Instead, we decorated our cars with crayola car paint markers and jumped out of the vans energetically with big bright smiles. We ran up to a house door, rung the doorbell, and asked the parents if their children wanted to come to our @ORGANIZATION. We had to remember that these kids live in poverty and have gone through a lot. To share the gospel, it was important to show them that we were friendly so they could open up to us and let us tell them about @CAPS. When we laughed with the children, their eyes would always smile and twinkle. A lot of the children just needed love and we did so by laughing with them and making jokes to one another.  Assuredly, our youth group made a change in the children lives. Our @ORGANIZATION is probably one of the biggest highlights of the year for them. In @ORGANIZATION, the town's appearance is flat like a desert, there's no playgrounds, parks, or places they can go to and have fun. @CAPS gave us the power to share the gospel with these children and give them a fun @DATE to remember. @CAPS opened the hearts of the @CAPS children so that they @MONTH hear the word of @CAPS. I honestly don't think we could have reached out to them if we had not been a friendly bunch. It just shows how important it is to laugh with one another, whether it be with strangers or your family. If there is no laughter within your family, something is wrong. It's a sign of broken relationships and a sense of closeness that is lost. In commercials, there's always advertisements where families are around the dinner table, or at a restaurant laughing together. Not everybody has to look like that picture perfect family everyday, but when a family laughs with one another, it shows the unity they have. Usually when people laugh, they do so because they understand the situation and have respect for one another. Of course a family does not have to be related, it could be your youth group, your friends, or anyone you feel close to and comfortable with. Your comfortable person could even be your future spouse. My cousin's story on how he met his wife is like the scene in a chick-flick movie. My cousin, @PERSON, was working at a ski resort at the rental check-outs waxing skis, when a dark haired brunette comes toward him in her baggy snow pants and says, ""I can go down the biggest hill"" with the most flirtatious eyes and grin. Now, @PERSON was very confused as to why this girl would walk up to him and bluntly say that to him. But @PERSON was mesmerized with this gorgeous girl and all he could say was, ""@CAPS"". The girl seemed thoroughly pleased with his answer and asked him when his next shift was. An hour later, @PERSON and this girl were having lunch together in the cafeteria. It turns out, this girl's name is ""@PERSON"". Apparently, @PERSON's friends spotted @PERSON first and told @PERSON the guy had a great laugh and he looked like a good person. They urged @PERSON to ask him out and get to know him. @PERSON, being the daring one, agreed. @PERSON's story proves the point that laughter is important. You don't know @CAPS @MONTH hear you and how that person could effect your future.  Laughter is an important element in your life. It brings out the joy in people's spirit, gives you opportunities to meet new people, and perhaps change their lives. It reflects @CAPS you are and changes the atmosphere around you. After all, we wouldn't want our world to be like ""The @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS Laughter"" would we?",22,22,0.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.0,44.0
12461,20975,8," Laughter is a part of life. It can help bring people together or even tear them apart if it is in bad taste. There was a time when me and my cousin @PERSON did not really like each other but I had to stay at his house because my mom was out of town. After that night we were closer then brothers and there is one huge funny tale behind it. I was really reluctant to even go over there that night. But my mom told me to stop complaining and to just try to have fun. When I got there we pretty much just watched @LOCATION in awkward silence. Then his parents informed us that they were going out and that they would not be home until it was very late. About ten minutes after they left my cousin @PERSON turns to me and says ""you want to do something really fun."" @CAPS I was at the young age of thirteen years old a could not help but to be interested. So I asked him what this fun thing was and he told me it was a surprise. We left his house and cut through his field to the wall of blackberry bushes that surrounds his field and he showed me a little path through a certain spot. After we got through the bushes we ended up on a gravel road that led to a house that had a lot of land surrounding it. And on the land were what my cousin identified as fainting goats, I had no idea what fainting goats were. So my cousin said he should just show me what they are and what they do. @PERSON walked right up to these goats and made a sudden noise, about a quarter of them just fell over stiffened and unmoving. I was roaring with laughter at the fact that these goats fainted when they got scared. We spent about forty five minutes scaring them and watching them faint. No matter how many times we did it, we found it no less amusing then the first time. The funniest thing by far that happened that night, started off when @PERSON informed me that he brought an @NUM firework. We put it in the middle of where all the goats had flocked to and lit it. It went off and the bang that was as loud as a gunshot. As one entity the goats all collapsed and we were doubled up with laughter, that is until the people in the house came out side. We ran like our life's depended on it, we flew down the road through the blackberry path, trough the field and straight into @PERSON's house. We sat down on the couch then we looked at each other, we burst out laughing, my ribs were aching from it, I was light headed with laughter. His parents got home about a minute after we calmed down which we also found extremely funny. As soon as they went to bed we burst into silent giggles. That was one of the funnest times I've had with my cousin and even tough we did not like each other before hand, we ended up becoming brothers in all but blood, but we were cousins so maybe even a little bit by blood but mostly brothers in laughter.",20,16,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12462,20976,8," Laughter is an amazing thing. Laughter is bilingual. It does not need to be translated or looked up in a dictionary. It is the one form of communication that we all know and understand. Laughter has @CAPS boundary.  @CAPS was the most taciturn girl in the whole school. In the mornings and during lunch, @CAPS would hide in the shadows hoping not to be seen by the world. @CAPS @CAPS asked @CAPS what @CAPS wanted to be, @CAPS would say invisible. People passed @CAPS by without even a glance, thinking @CAPS I don't see @CAPS than @CAPS can't be there. My heart was sad for the poor girl because I knew @CAPS needed a friend. Someone that @CAPS could talk to, or atleast get a smile from. However, how would I approach @CAPS? Would @CAPS think that I was insane? I knew there had to be someway to get @CAPS to talk, or atleast smile. As I walked into school the @DATE, the hallway was filled with the same hullabaloo as always. Paper air-planes flying one direction and mouths going off in another. I was used to being shoved around and dodging things on my way to class. It was just the fun journey of getting to your @DATE period. Finally, as me and my gawky self made it to fourth period, I sat down and began to look for a pencil. As I did so, I noticed someone pulling out a chair @DATE to me and sitting down. It was the girl! I didn't even know @CAPS had this class with me, let alone sit right @DATE to me. I began to be overwhelmed with joy, knowing that this could be my chance. Futhermore, I began thinking of ways I could start a conversation with @CAPS. I noticed a picture on the front of @CAPS binder that someone had drawn. At the bottom was @CAPS signature. I asked @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS had drawn that picture. ""@CAPS,"" @CAPS said in very quiet voice. My heart was pounding, almost breaking free from my chest. I knew I had to say something more. ""@CAPS,"" I began, ""I believe @CAPS are a very good artist. Do @CAPS have any other pictures?"" ""@CAPS,"" @CAPS said again, ""however, they are all at home."" ""Is there any possible way that I @MONTH be able to see these other pictures of your's?"" I said happily. ""@CAPS @CAPS would like, @CAPS are more than welcome to come over to my house after to school today and see them."" @CAPS said in a very joyful voice. ""I would be honored,"" I said. As we ended the conversation, the teacher began @CAPS lesson. @CAPS was really a nice girl, I thought to myself. I couldn't wait until the end of the @DATE. When the school @DATE came to a close, we meant each other in the foyer. I could tell that @CAPS was very excited. I was excited as @CAPS, because I knew that @CAPS was fnally feeling confident with herself; like a baby bird flying away from its nest for the first time. We drove over to @CAPS house in my mighty mule of a truck. I became very nervous as we walked to the front door. As @CAPS opened it, my pounding heart flew from my chest. The house was absolutely beautiful. It smelled of fresh baked cookies with a hint of cinnamon. I could not believe what was before my eyes. My mind couldn't make sense of it all. @CAPS mother yelled from the other room, ""is that @CAPS sweetie?"" ""@CAPS mother,"" @CAPS said back, ""I have a friend over."" ""@CAPS!"" @CAPS mother exlaimed. We enjoyed some cookies and milk with @CAPS mother and then we went up to @CAPS room. @CAPS room was filled with so many beautiful drawings that @CAPS had done. @CAPS told me that there was a story behind each one of them that inspired @CAPS to draw it. @CAPS asked @CAPS I have ever drawn a picture before. ""@CAPS,"" I said, ""I am what @CAPS call challenged in the world of art."" We both began to laugh; however, we both began drawing a picture. In the midst of it all, I looked over at @CAPS picture. It was a beautiful drawing of a fairytale world filled with castles and dragons. Then, @CAPS looked at my picture. It was a failed attempt of drawing a simple sunset with clouds and birds. We looked at each other and then began to laugh hysterically. ""@CAPS're clouds look like potatoes,"" @CAPS said. Then we laughed even harder and we continued to laugh for what seemed like an hour. Finally, when i left the house and went home for the night. I realized something amazing, something that I had forgotten. It doesn't take much to reach out to someone that needs a friend. I also realized that it can be the most simple thing that can make @CAPS laugh; like a bad drawing. This is beacuse laughter is contagious and we all know that we all love to laugh.",20,22,0.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0
12463,20977,8," ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" @CAPS quote can be agreed by everyone on @LOCATION. Everyone loves to laugh and have a good time. Especially @CAPS with a person you care about. @CAPS is something you and another person can do together with ease. @CAPS brings two people closer together and brightens a person's life. Some people, like me, are always looking for a guy who knows how to make me smile and laugh. I need to know that arguing isn't going to be the main part of @CAPS relationship. Having someone who makes you laugh is a key factor in life. At the age of sixteen I had my first boyfriend. I was the girl who kept on rejecting guys and telling them I was trying to wait for that perfect guy. In the @DATE I met @ORGANIZATION. Even though he was older than me and we might be opposites, he always knows how to make me smile. My first impression of him was his cute smile. After getting to know him and talking on the phone a couple of times I realized that I started to have feelings for @CAPS boy. Whenever we talked he always had me @CAPS. I found @CAPS very attractive. Having someone who brings some sunshine into my life made me feel like I was on top of the world. On @DATE there was a football game, @ORGANIZATION (two schools who are rivals). During @CAPS time him and I still weren't dating. That day I invited him to come over so we could watch the game together. I had previously told him how I love stuffed animals. That day he showed up with a fluffy stuffed animal. We were walking around the track, @CAPS all of a sudden I tripped. My first reaction was to use my nervous laugh. He had his arm around me and whispered in my ear ""I would never let you @DATE."" I turned cherry red. From that day on he will remember me as the clumpsy girl who trips all the time. Now that i look back at the day I realize how funny that memory was. Looking back at embarrassing moments is always a good thing in a relationship.  @CAPS you are looking for someone who you want to spend the rest of your life together you have to make sure you like them for whom they are. You don't want them to change. The goal is to be able to spend time with someone who you can have a good time with and crack some jokes around. I always tell my friends ""@CAPS is a great ab workout."" Which is true because whenever I laugh, my abs are always sore the next day. Being able to have a good time with friends, and laugh about random stuff is always something I look forward to. If there is no @CAPS going on, then that means I'm not having a good time. But lucky me, I have amazing friends who make jokes about everything. Whenever I'm around them there is never a moment @CAPS I'm not @CAPS. Being able to make others laugh is a great characteristic in a person.  @CAPS you meet a new person, would you rather have awkward silence? Or do you prefer someone who will make you laugh? I'm hoping we have the same answer, because I hate awkward silence. I need to know that @CAPS person will make me laugh and smile and not make me be thinking ""@CAPS will I be able to leave?"" @CAPS is one of the worst situations anyone would want to go through, I can say @CAPS from personal experience. Even though I'm not the best at saying jokes, I use all my embarrassing moments and thats my way I have people @CAPS. I don't get mad about it, I'm the total opposite. I laugh along with them. I know I'm clumpsy, I know I have my moments, and if these things can bring a smile to a persons face, then I'm @PERCENT fine with it. My goal is to be able to make people smile @CAPS they are down. So instead of cracking a joke, I just remind them of an embarrassing thing that has happened to me. Everyone is unique in their own ways. That's what makes everyone special. Different people have different ways of making others laugh. And once a guy gets a girl to laugh, that's the first sign @CAPS guy was meant for them. Having someone who can make you smile is a key factor in life. @CAPS means that you are having a good time. @CAPS brings people together. @CAPS can brighten a persons life. So next time you meet someone, maybe a joke here and there will help you break the ice.",20,22,0.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0

So @CAPS asked us how to keep her interested, and we said that @CAPS should tell her some jokes to make her laugh. @CAPS said that @CAPS would think about it @CAPS was a real funny person and a blast to hang out with, so we didn't really worry about it so much, we thought that everything would be fine. So after all that @CAPS left and we started hanging out in my friend, @CAPS's living room. We were hanging out and just talking about who was the hottest girl at school. So an hour past and my friend @CAPS came back. @CAPS came and sat with us and yelled I didn't work man, I was like okay calm down, @CAPS happened I asked?. @CAPS said, she didn't think it was funny she thought that I was being dumb and just plain silly.

12467,20983,8," Laughter is an extremely important aspect for maintaining a relationship with someone or even a group of people. Some greatly beneficial uses of laughter include relieving tension in any intense or high pressure situation as well as connecting with other people in a more meaningful way. The implication of laughter is also a great way to create new friends. It is my opinion that healthy relationships whether they be a friendship or even greater, hardly exist without laughter and cannot flourish without it. I personally use laughter on a daily basis for these reasons among many others and it is a monumental element of my relationship with my father's side of the family. One specific example of how I utilize the essential tool of laughter in my family is to reconnect with members whom i have not seen in a long period of time. Laughter is a tremendous element of my relationship with my father's entire family, and small family meetings as well as full family reunions do not exist without it. Being that they are scattered across @LOCATION, and very few live in the vicinity of @LOCATION, visiting with these family members is a rare occasion. The most admirable quality of my father's side of the family is the innate sense of humor that everyone shares. Laughter simply seems to be another form of communication for our family and is the main reason we get along so well. Relationships that I share with individual family members can be observed in every family assembly as well. Just @DATE my sister was pregnant with her first child and her baby shower was set to be in @DATE. This event holds a specific example where laughter was a predominant element of a relationship between myself and one of my family members. Not only was I to be the only guy there, but I was also to be placed at a table with my aunt whom I had not seen for over a year. Although we had always enjoyed eachother's company in the past, I dreaded an awkward reunion and sitting in complete silence for the entirety of the festivities. The day of my sister's baby shower inevitably arrived and to my surprise, I was nervous. I assisted with the set up of the decorations as well as the other amenities and found my seat. Within ten minutes of doing so, my aunt and table partner entered and located her seat which was adjacent to mine. However nervous I had been, the very first thing my aunt did eased any tension that had built up in me and reminded me why I get along so well with my father's family. My aunt greeted me by cracking a joke towards how I was the only guy attending the shower. For the duration of the party, all I heard was jokes coming from my aunt and the laughter shared between the two of us. We reconnected and bonded as both family members as well as good friends and the use of laughter was responsible for it all. Through the use of laughter my aunt and I reconnected with one another and possibly had the most fun out of anyone who attended. Whether we were making jokes about some of the party gifts, or simply enjoying one of the ridiculous games, my aunt and myself were laughing hysterically. on this specific day and many others before and after, laughter was not only an element, but was the sole reason for my friendly relationship with my aunt.",20,23,0.0,43,0.0,0.0,0.0,43.0
12468,20984,8,"                     LaughterLaughter can change a lot in people,it can bring people together. It can also help with relationships to make the other person laugh is always a good thing. @CAPS your with your friends laughter can and will always be there, well i know it is with my friends and I. @CAPS your in a relationship or a friendship, @CAPS able to laugh with that other person is important because it can make you feel more connected to them,@CAPS you have a big group of friends that you just met you can all laugh together that's even better because then you know your getting somewhere.  My best friend and I laugh all the time, @CAPS can just look at me in a way I only understand and I'll know what @CAPS means, and then we both start laughing @CAPS we stand in a big group of friends and we start laughing, they all look at us funny. Then normally we tell them what were laughing about, most of the time they don't get it. My best friend and I are always together,besides school, we are always laughing no matter if its something that happened a day ago or a year ago. My best friend and i have a lot of inside jokes,we only have to bring one time of hanging out and if something funny happened we will start laughing about it again. In a relationship as in having a ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend"" one of the plus sides of things are to make them happy, and laugh, and love to be around you. My boyfriend does it to me, no matter if I'm not in a good mood he always tries to put a smile on my face, most of the time it works. @CAPS you have a boyfriend or girlfriend you always wanna try and make them happy. That means girls don't get over the stupid little things. Boys don't get mad @CAPS they want to hang out with there friends.  The best way to have a relationship with your boyfriend and your best friend is to make sure they don't hate one another, and if they do work it out in a way that you could hang out with your boyfriend one day and your best friend the other. My relationship works out amazing, because my best friend is dating my boyfriends best friend, so we can all hang out if we really wanted to and not fight it's nice to have all of us friends, that way we can go to the coast together and we can go out to dinner as a group. At this time we are thinking about planning a trip to the coast, and going there for a day were not totally sure though.  I think the best way to have a good relationship full of laughter is to make it your all. Just don't give your whole life to your boyfriend or girlfriend cause if you ever break up you won't have any friends, cause they won't want to hang out with you anymore because you left them for your boyfriend at the time. So i always try and tell my boyfriend that with out making it sound the wrong way. Normally the guys understand that you have a life too and it doesn't revolve around them. My friend did that once and @CAPS was not happy as all in the relationship,@CAPS told me they never laughed together or anything,@CAPS was afraid to break up with him though cause @CAPS would not have any friends,cause @CAPS made him her life.  Laughter can always make you feel better, it'd kinda like a healing process it will always be there, its just a matter if someone can make you laugh. Theirs people that can make you laugh and @CAPS and videos and family. @CAPS your with someone that makes you happy it is like you full of joy and enjoyment to be around them and you care for them and you feel comfortable around them. If you have struggles and get through them and they still make you laugh and happy you will know that they are the one your happy and can laugh around.

12470,20987,8,"  While you being to make any kinda of relationship with anyone, you are usually going to start off making jokes and being silly. Whether your trying to be flirty with them, or just be the funny one and make a good, first impression. Usually all of these things lead to someone laughing; even if they really didn't have a reason to. Anyone who is shy around new people, will most likely laugh about anything they say. If it's someone you already knew, you could always be giggling about something. There are different types of relationships you build with different people and laughter is almost always the number one way to keep it together.   When you have been in a strong friendship with someone, you are already very close with each other. The laughing, crying, and fighting you do with that person, will make the relationship stronger. There are times that you spend with another individual that will makes steps towards sticking together. From my experiences, i will become somebodies close friend for quite sometime; then we will get into an argument and no longer be friends. Although we fought and wished to not talk, we became good friends again because of all the time we had spent laughing together. Being sad all the time, with no one else to laugh with, made us realize how much we missed each other. Even though meeting someone new was simple; it didn't last as long as the friendship i had with the other person.  Truly, when you meet someone for the first time, whether it's a boy or a girl, you will laugh and make jokes almost the whole time. That might even be how it will stay. Once you have known a person for so long, you can tell what type of relationship you will have with them. The connection you make with them is simple;you could get along, or you could always argue. No matter what relationship you make with an acquaintance, will most likely be the same all the time. When you are not as close with another person, you tend to not care about the friendship as often. You wont be as emotional, although your experiences you have with them could always lead to laughing. The time you spend with anyone should always be full of fun and laughter.      Another form of laughter could be spent with a boyfriend or girlfriend. in my opinion, you will make a special connection with your other half. When two people have chosen to be together, they're choosing to spend their time getting to know each other on a different level. The fun and laughter they will create can put them on a higher level of love the you would have with a best friend. Couples should be enjoying their time together laughing, and making each other happy. Making each other laugh will allow them to be closer in friendship; becoming comfortable with one another. they will gain more confidence and ability, just by sharing the times laughing together.   The laughter you laugh with anyone, will build any type of relationship. Usually the first impression will identify the connection you have with that individual. There are always ways that you will act with one person and not the other. The three different types of friendship that are most common are; acquaintances, boy friend/girl friend, and close friends. All of the friends you make, people you meet, will involve a lot of laughter.",20,15,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12471,20988,8,"  What's Laughter if not a smile, a small chunk of happiness like a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven, chocolate oozing out of the sides like waterfalls. Laughter can come from a joke, a awkward situation or just about anything. Laughter can be the thing that bonds a friendship. I'm going to tell @CAPS a true story surrounding the matter of laughter and how it has been involved in a relationship of my own. It was my first day of high school, I walked in the school looking down at my shoes. I could feel the people around me staring at me but I wasn't sure if I should look back at them and smile or if I should just keep to myself, so I said nothing. I went to the office and I asked them how to find drama class, they give me a map that I had no idea how to read and sent me off. By this time I was scared. A tall @CAPS guy with brown shaggy hair and a flannel jacket bumps into me and instead of an ""I'm sorry"" or even a polite ""@CAPS me"" he looked at me disgusted and continued down the hallway. It took me some time but I finally found my drama class. The teacher wasn't nice to me, it seemed like she hated everyone. She was kind of rounder and she had short blond hair. Her name was @PERSON and she is not in a good mood today. There was a girl sitting next to me and she looked just as scared as I felt. During the first @NUM minutes of class we glanced at each other a few times but we said nothing. About half way through the class the girl next to me asked my name, I replied ""@CAPS"" extremely quietly. As I went to turn away she grabbed my attention by whispering to me, she chuckled ""@CAPS @CAPS see what she's wearing? What are teachers thinking when they get dressed in the morning?"" I started laughing hysterically. The large teacher lurking in front of me said ""@CAPS two, hallway, now!"" I didn't know if laughing was an option but as soon as I stepped out of that door a grin crossed my face and I fell on the floor laughing. I couldn't control myself. Don't get me wrong I didn't think us getting into trouble was funny but this bitter teacher was such a disappointment. Drama teachers are supposed to be fun and nice, or so I thought. The next class period I walked through the auditorium doors and found myself a seat close to the back, next to @CAPS. @PERSON was wearing a green top that looked like it had been spattered with baby throw up, a pair of light blue skinny jean that did not flatter her body, and a pair of hot pink @NUM inch high heels. Today she was in a great mood, @CAPS could tell by the big fat smile on her face. When anyone talked she would burn a whole in there foreheads with her eyes. It was like getting stung by a bee on a hot @DATE day. We would all laugh behind her back but that's the way we got through her class alive. After a few minutes of talking she sent us off to @CAPS our first scene. The people in my group were @CAPS, my friend @CAPS who I had met in algebra the day before and a girl I didn't know named @ORGANIZATION'montae. We all got to know each other quite quickly because we all loved the joys of laughing. @ORGANIZATION'montae was @CAPS @CAPS as was @CAPS. @ORGANIZATION'montae was taller than me by about @NUM inches. She had blond in her hair that was only in her bangs. She was stunningly pretty. @CAPS was a quiet, @CAPS it alone type of person. She was about @NUM inches shorter then me and she had short black hair. It was straight, as I would quickly learn it always was. She was stylish, she had on the cutest brown belt and shoes that matched it with skinny jeans and a @CAPS jacket. Her whole outfit screamed adorable. We laughed the whole time, making fun of the teacher and telling jokes. We got barely any work done. That was a day I'll never forget. To this day, I'm still good friends with all three of them and often we talk about that day, and how glad we are that we met. So, as @CAPS can see laughing is a big part of my relationships. Its a great way to make friends and everyone loves to laugh. Even when @CAPS barely know someone @CAPS can quickly find out that laughing leads to friendships. It's like being in your favorite place on earth for just a moment. Laughter is a good way to become close to the people around @CAPS. The next time your with your friends or grouped with strangers tell them a joke. Priceless! ",20,18,36.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12472,20992,8," So many people sing songs and write stories about sad depressing events, like it's the only thing life consists of. We seem to never stop and focus on the little things. If we could stop and appreciate those little things, everyone would realize just how much they really have. In some way or another we all seek pity and for some reason we want to have the worse story. Like it's some sort of competition. I personally don't want to have the worse story. If you just ""go with it"" things seem more lighthearted, care free, and people would rather be around someone that makes them feel good and happy than someone that makes them feel sad. There is many times where I could have chosen to stay mad and upset, but instead I chose to just laugh, and not make a big deal out of a small mistake. For example, @DATE was the @CAPS dance. I was supposed to be there early to finish decorating, but I was late (like always). It didn't really matter that I was late because when I got there I found out that it was canceled. By the time they decided to cancel it (due to a power outage) my parents already drove away and they didn't have their cell phones with them. I was stuck at the school. While I was trying to get hold of somebody to pick me up, two of my friends showed up, even though I told them that the dance was canceled. My friend's mom was nice enough to come pick us up. We met the rest of our friends downtown, where we decided to go to @LOCATION's and play arcade games. We had an amazing time! We all got matching rings and I got two lollipops. When we were done we went up to our friends house, where we watched movies and ate popcorn. I had eaten way to much sugar and was super hyper! I kept saying a ton of random things, but it made for a great evening full of laughing. I could have been really upset that the dance was canceled, all of us could have, but we made the most out of what we had and ended up having a really good time. And I personally think it was more fun than the dance would have been. Another example is when I was a freshman. There was one day that seem particularly hard. I felt like nobody wanted to be my friend or hang out with me. I remember sitting in the hall by myself, feeling like nobody cared. A senior that year came up to me and started talking to me. I remember him telling me that it's harder frown than it is to smile. I realized that he was absolutely right. Even though smiling takes more muscles, frowning in the long run has a worse effect. If I could go back to that day I wouldn't be such a drama queen. I was making a big deal out of something that wasn't even true. I always say things that I latter regret, but if I just ""go with it"" it doesn't seem near as bad. If I could, I would write a dozen songs that have no sad or depressing meaning. Or a millions books based on the happiest things in life. If you fall down, it's better to laugh than to run away crying. What won't kill you will make you stronger. Lots of things make you stronger, like: breakups, heartaches, @CAPS.E class, and of course laughing. Laughing also makes you live longer; so why wouldn't you laugh as much as you possible could?",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12473,20993,8," Many have heard that laughing makes you live longer. I don't know if this is true but I can believe it. When I laugh I feel lighter, my stress load lightens, @PERSON I am able to see the world with different eyes. This change in myself is more evident sometimes than others, such as if before the miracle of laughter I was feeling overworked, worn out, or sad. It is my belief that having people to make you laugh is essential to living a fulfilling life, @PERSON I am grateful that my days are filled with great friends @PERSON funny memories.  One of the things that must be present in any relationship is humor; you must be able to make each other laugh. I have had multiple times with my two best friends, @PERSON, when we simply couldn't stop laughing. I deeply cherish all the time we spend alone together because I know that I will leave feeling happy, with a smile on my face, with many good stories to tell. One of these occasions was @PERSON's birthday party the @DATE before last.  @PERSON wanted a small party with just the people closest to her there, so @PERSON @PERSON I were the only ones invited. We live a tiny, cute town, however, there isn't much to do in the area of parties. Because of this, everyone ends up going to @CAPS, just half an hour away. It was a blistering @DATE day @PERSON we wanted to show off our tans, so of course @PERSON started her party off with a float on the meandering @CAPS river. That's when the laughing began. Three twelve year old girls drifting down a river by themselves with a giant beach ball (early birthday present) that was promptly dubbed @CAPS, what could be so funny? One of the things that makes our friendship so important to preserve is how we find humor in every situation when we are together. They thought it was hilarious that I have an irrational fear of seaweed (or river weed, or pond weed, or any type of water weed for that matter ) @PERSON that I would yelp or full out scream every time that some touched me. I thought it was fantastic that @PERSON just couldn't hold on to her sandals, @PERSON would end up making wild dives for them as they floated away. We both thought the way @PERSON, the @CAPS that she is, was reluctant to get wet was preposterous. @PERSON, naturally, we pushed her in numerous times. These are the things that make our relationship so special. We can be serious for each other when needed, @PERSON no one will disrespect my friends @PERSON get away with it, but when we are together, I can let my guard down @PERSON can be myself. My goofy, irrational, apparently hilarious self, @PERSON still have fun.  Our laughter can even change how a situation is going to progress. For example, after we were done on the river, @PERSON @PERSON @PERSON @PERSON I went to @ORGANIZATION for an afternoon of music @PERSON food. We all got enormous ice cream cones, the best money can buy. My friends had already finished theirs, @PERSON were playing with @CAPS a few yards away. I was just about to take another heavenly lick of my waffle cone when the @CAPS the ball flies over @PERSON knocks all the ice cream right out of my cone! I was left with a completely intact cone, but all of the good stuff was on the ground. Needless to say, I was devastated. Who knows what would have happened if @PERSON @PERSON @PERSON hadn't started laughing. Maybe I would have teared up, or sulked for an hour or two. However, my face was just so comical, staring in disbelief at the empty cone, that they just couldn't help but laugh. They fell on the grass, in hysterics. Even through my disappointment I started cracking up as well, @PERSON then everything seemed okay. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people, or three in my case. My two best friends make me laugh like no other people I have ever met, @PERSON I suspect I will never meet anyone else that makes me feel as they do. This laughter we have makes us feel better. It helps us relax @PERSON let our guard down, so the times after we laugh together is often when we confide in each other the most. If one of us is feeling down, or is under the weather, laughter is the sure fire way to get them back on their feet @PERSON smiling. Even simply being with them makes me feel more exuberant, lets me abandon my troubles. This is why laughter is so important to the the three of us. Whenever we laugh, our relationship builds. It is the good times we have had that help us through the bad times, @PERSON I know that our good times wouldn't have been so good were it not for the way we can laugh together.",20,25,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12474,20994,8,"                                         The @CAPS of Laughter  Many people think it is love that brings people together. But love is something that develops over time and brings people closer in the long run. Before you've ever loved someone though, you've laughed with them. Laughter creates conversation, mends relationships, and brings joy to people. Its an important part of any relationship and has certainly helped me make friends.   In the kindergarten, everything was new to me. I got to leave my house, go to school, eat lunch, and go to recess. There were many children just like me, bouncing with excitement as our daily routine started. Although we played together at school, at home there was no one around to play with.   One day after school, I noticed a boy walking around next to my yard. I walked over and remembered him from that school day in my classroom.  ""@CAPS"", was all I said. He turned around, and with all his might, burped as loud as he could. We fell into a fit of laughter and I knew I'd made a new friend that day. From then on, him and I were bestfriends. Any adventure that happened after school always ended with us laughing about something. There was no need for our parents to set up any ""playdates"" or scheduled time to meet other children because it was easier to laugh at something and make a friend naturally, not awkwardly while the parents chatted. From then on, making friends was a piece of cake.Through grade school and well into my teenage years, I had a best friend and a lot more friends, solely, because of a moment of laughter.  Laughing is something that can always ""break the ice"". Whenever you meet someone new, it's always kind of hard to just talk to them. You don't know whether to be serious, outgoing, funny, or quiet. But if something happens that makes both of you laugh, then it becomes easier to communicate because that laughter eases some of the tension in between. It's like riding a bike, after the initial awkwardness, things just get easier and easier.  For many, laughter helps heal pain. Tragic things happen in every persons life and it can be hard to deal with at times. Whether it's a breakup, a depressive mood, or maybe even a death of a loved one, something funny and a laugh @MONTH help them get their mind off of whatever is bothering them. Most of them time that's all a person wants, something to help them forget what ever troubles them, if only for a few minutes. It's how people build better relationships, they do whatever they can for each other to make each other feel better.   Besides it's healing and conversation starting qualities, laughing is simply fun to do. It @MONTH start out as a small giggle, turn into a chuckle, and end up as a fifteen minute session of raging, side cramping laughter. And most of the time, you're with friends so they're enjoying the moment of fun and happiness right along with you.   If you've never laughed once in your life, there's something wrong. It will eliminate awkward moments, relieve painful thoughts or feelings, and create instant fun. Just try it, it's not that hard. I guarantee that it will bring you closer to someone, make life less stressful, and make you happy.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12475,20996,8,"When I was younger my sister and I would fight all the time. It would either be verbally or physically. Whatever we fought about we would drag on for hours. Not only would we get more upset as time went on, but my mom and family members got fed up. It didn't help that there was only @NUM months between us. It would make everything ten times more tense. My mom had a few tactics to try to get us to stop. One would be grounding us. But we shared a room so that would only make it worse. Another was giving us chores which took up both our time and was annoying , the last one was making us sit criss cross apple sauce, face eachother, and hold hands. We hated this one. But every time that we did it we would end up cracking up and forgetting what we were even fighting about. After we did this we would give eachother a hug and move on.

12476,20998,8," Life is so uncertain, unfair, and unforgiving, but one simple thing can change that view on the cruelty of the world; laughter. In your deepest concern in your darkest thoughts laughter can bring the sun. Laughter is a cure for the sick, a pill for the wounded, and comfort for the old. We give not even the slightest thought to laughing, when in return it gives us joy and happiness. Laughter is the light at the end of the tunnel, a flashlight for the lost, and a lifeline for the hopeless. Laughter truly is the cure for all of humanity. Explaining laughter is like explaining why we breath, we just do, it's a part of living. It's natural for people to laugh, maybe not always appropriate, but it's something we revert back to in necessary times. Laughing makes dreams, hopes, and puts to rest the thoughts of uncertainty. Laughing is a friend, a helper, and an icebreaker to many leaving joy and hope to everyone that it meets. It's part of life we must cherish every moment we can.  Many times laughter has helped me, but one time sticks out more then the rest. A moment, a simple moment were laughter changed me, my views, and life itself; putting my life into motion. With shoulders slumped I listened to my six period teacher as she droned on about nothing important. I turned around hoping to find something to distract me. When I turned I met eyes with a man I had never had spoken to, he watched me with curiosity waiting for my explanation. I wanted, no, needed to talk to him so I took a chance. ""@CAPS you watched wrestling?"" he smiled and chuckled.without that the conversation would @CAPS been totally different. He could @CAPS ignored me, but he laughed and that altered the course of my life. Soon after that, that man became my boyfriend, because we talked after I asked him that. That laugh made everything so simple, it made the puzzle fall into place. Moments @CAPS arise when laughing has dug me a pit of ruins. Even though laughing is such a wonderful thing you still need to be careful and know when the right time to laugh is and when its not. Again a moment that sticks to me was a time when I was young. I played by myself for the most part picking up a barbie I brushed her hair,""@CAPS come here."" I heard my father call.I went to the living room where my brother already reside and waited with my barbie. My father kneel to talk,""@CAPS going to be leaving soon because she needs sometime. I want you to go with her and make sure everything is okay. I want you to stay with her and I'll see you when I can. I love you @CAPS always remember that."" I bubbled with laughter, I didn't realize or even comprehend what was really going on. I laughed as we got into the car, by the time we were gone i realized how serious this issue was. Maybe I didn't hurt anyone by laughing, but it hurt me for not taking it so serious.  Life is never know, we never know where life will take us, lead us, kick us, or drop us. Laughter is an emotion and can cure the wounds, but its also a power we must not mistreat or misuse. Giving us joy and fun, it helps pick us up when we fall and it rejoices us. Laughter is a way of life and the savior of humanity.",20,16,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12477,20999,8," Laughter? What is laughter? Well laughter is a contagious disease which is passed around by a group of people from one to the other, ( @CAPS speaking) and should be included in every persons life while they are growing up. Here is a true story of how laughter played a key part in my life as a kid. My @CAPS has five days of laughter as I call them, that we all celebrate through out the year: birthdays, @LOCATION, the @DATE of @DATE, @CAPS , and @CAPS. On my birthday the whole @CAPS gets together at my grandparents house to celebrate the day I was brought into this world. Usually a couple of days before my birthday my mom grants me the authority to invite some of my friends to come over to go see some event or go to the arcade. Then when we get home we all stay up late playing video games and watching movies.  When @LOCATION finally decides to greet us with its colorful eggs and candy, my @CAPS meets at my uncles house to hide the eggs for us children to find. Which we always seem to miss at least one every year. While we are finding the eggs our parents are taking them and hiding them again. When we first noticed, it was when my uncle was climbing the willow tree in the back yard and placing the eggs back in the spots where we found them. Then watching him try to climb down again. When that is all over we play a game of hid-n-seek. Which is kinda hard to win when there is fourteen people hiding over a one acre lot. On the @DATE every one has their own agenda that they fallow. My dad and me go to @LOCATION, @ORGANIZATION to light @CAPS on the third of @DATE for @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS. While waiting for the show to start we play a game of laser tag which ends up being a big game of around fifty people or so. Then on the @DATE my dad does his own show in the back yard for us kids which is really exhilarating to watch.  Then comes my favorite laughing day @CAPS. My dad sets up his house as a haunted house. Which is fun since we all get painter and shot up with silly string being flung at us from unseen sources. When we go trick or treating I am usually a solider with a @CAPS gun unloaded and fully camouflaged, which makes for an interesting night when they cant find me even though I am right beside them. Later when we get back home it is a competition to see who got the most candy, I usually win because I get to stay out later than my siblings do. Well then, now for the holiday that wraps up all other holidays @CAPS! a time of gift giving and receiving. mostly receiving for me. We all have a dish we cook and end up with part of that dish on me or whoever dares to enter the kitchen when I am cooking. After every one gets done eating we sit down and commence the opening of the presents in order from youngest to oldest. Then it is a free for all for your own presents until the adults but in and make us go in order again. Its funny to watch them when they are chasing my cousin around the house because he took a present from them. So that is my story of what a year of laughter is for me in a nut shell. That is why laughter should be in everyone's life as they are growing up. It relaxes and builds relationships at the same time. Like a saying my grandparents used to say to us kids when we were sad ""A laugh a day will keep the @CAPS at @LOCATION"".",19,18,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12478,21000,8,"                          A funny Story  Many summers ago, @CAPS best friend @PERSON and I had a sleepover at @CAPS house. We were both excited because @CAPS dad would be the only one there. @CAPS mom and brother were out late. After eating popcorn and getting stuffed up on candy, we decided to try something new and fun. @CAPS house has a counter bar where four to five people can sit at and so @CAPS daddy decided to turn on some hip hop music. As though @PERSON and I could read each others minds we jumped on the counter and started doing the run way model walk. We worked it like no other. It was funny to see @CAPS dad pretending to be the fake photographer and say that's ""gorgeous"" as though he was a real photographer. @PERSON and I strutted up and down and did stops and poses and turns, until we got too dizzy. We all knew we could never do this with @CAPS mom @ORGANIZATION which made everything so funny! We all bursted out laughing until we couldn't breath! Later on after that fun model runway we decided to pillow surf down the stairs. I was a little afraid to at first but after I saw the look on @PERSON's face, I knew I had to do it. I grabbed a big body pillow and surfed down those stairs like a champ! It was such a blast! @PERSON and I kept pillow @CAPS for what seems forever! @CAPS dad put on @ORGANIZATION and we laughed the rest of the night away. That night was one of the best and @ORGANIZATION memories of @CAPS childhood.                                          ",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12479,21001,8," In my opinion, I think that laughter is a very important part of life. What would the world be like without laughter and jokes? It would be a very boring and dull place. I can't even imagine what it would be like. The world needs to have laughter in it. People need to make jokes and they need to have laughter and comedy in their life. I myself have a lot of laughter in my life. One day in fifth grade my best friend and I were jogging around the track for gym class. We were running together and talking and telling jokes to each other to help pass the time because it was really boring. I told this one really awesome joke, I can't remember what it was, and he started laughing so hard. We were both laughing together to the point we were crying. He fell down on the track, and rolled off into the grass. I said ""@CAPS on we need to keep going or the gym teacher will get mad"". He said, ""I can't, I just peed my pants!."" That made me laugh even more. He got up and walked over to the gym teacher. The gym teacher told my friend to go to the nurse's office. After gym class was over I met him back up with him in the classroom and he told me he called his mom and she brought him a new pair of underwear and pants. I wonder what his mom must have thought. It was a funny day.  We have always talked about that day together from then on. I would always jokingly make fun of him for peeing his pants, but I told him a funny joke. Our whole relationship was based on making each other laugh and telling jokes. Just all around the two of us being stupid together was what we did. Jokes and laughter made our friendship so much better and gave me amazing memories that I might possibly have for the rest of my life. At the same time, if you have no jokes and laughter in your friendship, it can make your relationship very boring and lame. If you do not have any, or little laughter in your friendship, then you do not have fun with that person and it makes you not want to hang around them because it just feels boring.  I have this other friend named @CAPS, I occasionally go over to his house and we hang out and play video games together. The weird thing is, we hardly even communicate with each other. We just do stuff and don't have any fun with it. There is no jokes or laughter or anything awesome like that. We just play his video games silently not saying a word to the other person. Its the most pathetic thing I have ever seen. It is the most boring friendship two people could have. It is really boring over there because we just do the same thing over and over. I don't really like going over there that much. I would rather be at a different friends house having fun, but I still go over there anyway and I am not sure why. Without jokes and laughter in a friendship, it just makes things boring and not fun. It is something you definitely need to have. Laughter is not just an important element in a friendship, it is also an important element to have in a dating relationship. If you are dating somebody, then you absolutely need to have laughter in your relationship. If you look around you always see couples making jokes together and laughing with each other all the time, having fun. It makes their relationship interesting and enjoyable. Think about it, who wants to date a boring person that doesn't like to laugh and make jokes? Nobody wants to. So in a dating relationship you especially need laughter and comedy more than in a friendship. You want to keep things going good so the other person likes you and thinks your funny. That is one of the key things that makes a couple close. So as you can see by my three examples, laughter really makes a big difference in relationships and just in life in general. If you have laughter in a friendship it can really impact the relationship in a very good way. It makes it an interesting and fun relationship. Laughter makes people happy and get along with each other. If you are feeling down, laughter can always bring you up and make you feel better. It is almost like a medicine. If you do not have laughter, it can really make things suck, and make the relationship boring. Nobody wants that. People do not want a boring, lifeless relationship with somebody. Laughter is something that bring people together in a good way. It brings all of my friends together and makes us better friends. We have a good time and really enjoy ourselves. Laughter is a great thing that everybody needs to have in their life. ",20,21,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0

I was not sure of how this would happen but I hoped for the best. I entered my first class and sat at a table with all unknown faces. I wanted to say something but was afraid of their reactions. The teacher made us play a couple games where we had to introduce ourselves. Those didn't really help. Everybody was tense and it was all awkward. I @CAPS wanted to be myself already and make friends. For the rest of the day, all my classes were like that. Everybody was tense and awkward, like something was keeping us quiet. Not knowing anybody didn't help the situation a bit. That was the first day for me. The second day I walk through the school doors determined to make some friends. I thought about what jokes I could say, what interesting thing about myself I could share, but to me all those sounded like stupid ideas. I walk into humanities and sat at a table with a friendly looking girl. The teacher told us to introduce ourselves to the other students at the table we were sitting at. For a minute or so it was very silent, but i wanted to introduce myself so bad. I couldn't stand this silence any longer. I looked in by back pack to grab a pencil and I see a note from my mom saying "" @CAPS be yourself and make some friends honey, have a great day at school. :) "". I started laughing because I thought it was funny that my mom actually wrote me a note and stuck it in my back pack. It was so unexpected and I felt like a child. I started laughing and when I looked up, I saw that the girl next to me was laughing too. I knew I had to say something, so I did. I said, "" @CAPS my names @PERSON, but you can call me @CAPS for short. Whats your name? "". The girl looked at me, smiled, and said, "" @CAPS, my names @CAPS"". Then I asked her what middle school she came from and other questions. We stared talking, we exchanged numbers, and we became good friends. From laughter to @CAPS, who would have known? A year has gone by and we are still friends. We always laugh about how we started talking. A few days ago I told her how I felt @CAPS that second day of school. I told her I was scared to introduce myself. She said she felt the same way and she didn't know what to do either. Since then I thank my mom for writing that note because without it I wouldn't have laughed and made @CAPS laugh and I wouldn't have made such a great friend.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12481,21003,8," It's the first day of high school and your gut is full of butterflies that make you want to run to the bathrooms and hide from the world. I had @CAPS friends yet and I was to shy to go and join any of the groups so I walked to all of my classes alone. Students would get in my face wanting to know what school I came from and wanted to know all about me. I remember wanting to be left alone, hidden in my own bubble space. Girls would ask @CAPS I was upset since I wasn't smiling or having fun getting to know my new classes. Lunch was much more crowded than my old school. Students would sit in hallways eating their lunch or crowd around one big table chattering loudly to one another. I chewed on my lip looking for a spot that wasn't occupied by students. I found a table near the front of the lunch room that was empty and placed my brown lunch sack in front of me eating my peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Two boys and two girls rushed over and settled down next to me laughing at one another for not getting a seat next to me.""@CAPS I'm @PERSON, what's your name?"" was a skinny boy in a black caps response to me. ""@PERSON"" was all I replied to all of them who stared at me the entire time.""That's a pretty name, I'm @LOCATION, this is @LOCATION, you just met @PERSON, and @PERSON is the funny kid next to you with his orange back pack,"" I smiled and nodded to them @ORGANIZATION had on a @CAPS @CAPS t-shirt and @PERSON had on a military uniform that said @CAPS. They all ate lunch at the school and got pizza or sub sandwiches. They showed pictures of funny events on their phones to everyone even including me.""@CAPS that kid isn't careful he might get razor rash."" I said laughing a little looking at the picture of a little boy sliding down a slide that looked like a cheese grader. @PERSON took off all his pepperoni and was flinging it randomly in the air. @PERSON was going to take a picture of everyone for picture id on her phone. @PERSON was next for his picture to be taken when the pepperoni in @LOCATION's hands slipped and landed smack on @ORGANIZATION's face. I busted up laughing and everyone at the table joined in. @PERSON and I were clenching our stomachs and wiping away tears. @PERSON went to the bathroom to wash away the smell from his face and when he returned @PERSON said,""@CAPS my word you should see your face I took your picture right after the pepperoni hit your face and your picture is just hilarious, your mouth is hanging open like your going to eat something and like your angry."" @PERSON handed her phone to one person at a time and we all started to laugh again asking for @PERSON to send the picture to each of them.""I was wondering @CAPS I could be your guys friend?"" I asked looking them all in the eye. @ORGANIZATION was the only one to respond,""@CAPS you can't be our friend, @PERSON duh @CAPS we didn't want to be your friend then we wouldn't be hanging out with you."" @ORGANIZATION teased. My twisted gut loosened with re-leaf.""@CAPS we probably would have made some excuse to leave,"" @PERSON smiled.

12482,21004,8,"Laughter can sometimes be something that everyone shares together, sometimes it's used only for few as it's aimed against one another. But hopefully most of the time it's something that we all can share. Laughter opens up a relationship to where people can feel more comfortable with one another. Someone could be a complete stranger to one another and then just by a simple joke, laughter could make them look like they've been friends for years. Now laughing isn't the only thing that helps people become acquainted with one another, they can share similar hobbies or likes and dislikes, but most of the time laughter is something that everyone needs in a relationship. I remember when I fisrt met my friend @PERSON, he wasn't to outgoing, but through making jokes he seemed more comfortable in talking with others. Me and him would often talk about @CAPS our daily lifes where to much to handle, but instead of making jokes about it, we decided to laugh about @CAPS we were complaining when our lifes we easy compared to others. Some people have to work @NUM jobs to support a family and we're over here complaining about @CAPS we have to wake up and go to school, we laughed at @CAPS pathetic we sounded. A couple of days later we found ourselves thinking about what we wanted to do when we older and out of high school. @PERSON said he wants to be a taekwando instuctor and that he's already got a small job at one, I said ""@CAPS did you get the job?"", he replied ""I kicked a kid in the face pretty hard when my instuctor was watching"".

The best kind of laughter is when you're out of breath and crying. It makes people so happy and wanting more. Don't take life too seriously, just laugh and smile all the time.  Someone dying is a dreadful thing. When two high school boys die, it's even worse. On a @DATE @TIME, a group of high school students were walking on the rocks by the ocean, when a sneaker wave snatched two of them. The other kids tried so hard to save them by making a rope of clothing to reach them, but it didn't work. Two beautiful lives were taken away that day, and will not be forgotten. The boys were well liked and had great lives. The families of the students, the school, friends and the community were in shock, and couldn't believe the terrible news. How could this happen to such amazing people.  Hundreds of students gathered at church the following @DATE, most in tears. They talked about the two boys, and had a huge group prayer. Friends spoke well of them, missing them greatly, talking about the good, fun, memorable times. @CAPS can make it better. As someone once said, smile because they lived, don't cry because they're gone. At the school's basketball game, they honored the boys, and won the game for them. Parents and friends spoke about the beautiful kids in front of almost @NUM people, that came to support the school. The game was a time for having a good time and not to sob and mope. This game helped heal the community just a little more. @CAPS and cheering really can help the heart.  As days, weeks, and months go on, people will still be heartbroken. Although, as long as we laugh and smile about the good times of those who left, we can make it though anything. @CAPS makes you feel better. It just shows you that you have to make the best with what you have, and always have a fun time with no regrets. Always tell the people that mean something to you, that you love them.

When I was younger it was the typical older sister @LOCATION younger sister vibe, frankly we did not like each other at all. Through maturing, entering high school, and being part of the same cheer leading organization we have spent almost too much time together and now it's almost as if we are the best of friends. In the @DATE we were together constantly. We would watchJerry @PERSON, laugh and/or make fun of the people who volunteered to be on the show. We would watch clips of the showSaturday @TIME @CAPS, that's where I introduced her to the character ""@CAPS"". @PERSON and I would talk to each other in the voice that we adapted from ""@CAPS"" and laugh constantly about @NUM @TIME @CAPS is also where we adapted the ""demonic voice"". We would talk to each other, and our friends in these voices. Both of us still talk like that @DATE. As we entered high school we had to start driving together everyday to and from school. We would listen to music, make up random dance moves and sometimes I would have to steer if her favorite song came on(she was a very energetic dancer). It was all in good fun though. When we would enter into the school everything would change though and I understood that after about a week. I was the annoying younger sister who couldn't say hi to her in the hall or wave at her when she was around her friends. She wanted to be left alone so she wouldn't look weird. She was a junior then, they always think their the coolest around. Once she was a senior she would say hi to me, she would smile when she saw me, I even talked to her and her friends sometime. We also grew closer once I entered the student leadership class that she was also apart of, we had the same class every other day it was hard not to talk to each other.  The single thing that I believe has made our relationship closer because of laughter was the three weeks she stayed in my room. She decided to ""move in"" when she would wake up in the morning with bug bites on her arms and legs and she would have no idea what they were from. We suspected that she just didn't remember getting them when she was out the @TIME before, but then when she wouldn't go out she still got them. We figured out what it was when her friend @PERSON came over; she had bed bugs. That @TIME I separated the two mattresses I sleep on and made her a bed thinking she would only be there for two three nights tops so my parents had time to disinfect her room. That turned into two three weeks. We spend almost every hour of every day together those three weeks, the only peace I got was in the shower. We would stay up late talking about our day, who we didn't like, who's outfit we really liked that day, what we wanted to do in cheer practice and who could have done better at cheering. If you knew @PERSON you would know how scared she gets over a movie so half the time when we were up late I was next to her trying to scare her. It's quite funny to see her reaction. Finally she ""moved out"" and I got my room back though I don't think, even now it feels the same as it did. They say many things about laughter; ""Laughter is the best medicine"" ""Laughter is the shortest distance between people"" ""@CAPS two people in a room, they'll be laughing in @NUM minutes""; All of these talking about how relationships grow with laughter. I have the funniest, silliest, greatest sister in the world because we can laugh at the same things. We have the same mind people say, we do a lot of the same things, we think a lot alike, and we wear a lot of the same things as well. I am positive laughter has strengthened my sister and I's relationship. I bet if you really look at the relationship between you and someone you're close to, the first memory you think of is a happy moment of you laughing.",20,18,36.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12485,21007,8,"One day i was going to my friend @ORGANIZATION @PERSON's house for her @NUM birthday party. I knew the birthday party was going to be a lot of fun even though it was only going to be @ORGANIZATION, @CAPS and I. I didn't know it was going to be as fun as it turned out to be though. The whole day i was waiting for it to be @NUM so i could go to her house. I packed all my bags and got everything ready, because it was a sleep over. As i was one my way to her she called me and said ""before you get to my house look to the right.""  The whole way my dad and i were driving to her house i kept my eyes on the right side of the rode, i wasn't quit sure what i was looking for though. As we got closer i saw something in the bushes. It was @ORGANIZATION and @PERSON. I told my dad to honk at them so they knew i was there and as he did, they both pulled down there pants and mooned us! I was laughing so hard the whole night i kept thinking about the look on my dads face! Little did i know that wasn't going to be the funniest thing that happened that night. Later on @ORGANIZATION, @PERSON and I went on a walk down to the dock by @LOCATION house. While we were on the dock a bat flew by and @PERSON almost fell in the water cause she was so scared. @ORGANIZATION and I were standing behind her laughing so hard! By that time it was getting kind of dark and her neighbors were being really loud. So we ran from the dock to her neighbors house and hid and started yelling things at them to quiet down! It was so funny because they had no idea where the yells were coming from so they just kept looking around confused. We started laughing so hard we could hardly be quiet. We had to wait a while for her neighbors to stop looking around trying to figure out who was telling them to be quiet. That's not the funniest thing that happened either! As we were walking back to @LOCATION house we heard a car coming so we made a plan I stood in the middle of the street and @ORGANIZATION stood ahead of me while @PERSON was hiding in the bushes. The plan was @ORGANIZATION and I were going to pretend to be in a fight and @PERSON was going to run out of the bushes and pretend to shoot me. So the car starts turning the corner and me and @ORGANIZATION start fake fighting. As the car gets closer it starts slowing down and here come @PERSON running out of the bushes and @CAPS! Pretends to fake shoot me. I fall to the ground like i am really hurt trying to hold back my laughs, and man did we think we got the people in the car good. Then we realize there is no way she actually shot me when there was no gun shot sound at all! So the people in the car come up closer and they are laughing so hard that we can hear them before we can even see who it is. When they got closer we realized it was just some of @ORGANIZATION's family friends coming over for the party so they knew it was fake the whole time. When it got darker outside we found a huge watermelon and took it out to a bridge by @LOCATION house. We brought her video camera and put it on night vision and threw the watermelon of the bridge. When it hit the water it mad a really loud sound and split into a bunch of tiny pieces! That night was one of the best and funniest nights i have ever had. The next day all the fun continued by going to the lake and swinging on rope swings into the water. @ORGANIZATION got a really bad rope burn and it was hilarious! @PERSON, @ORGANIZATION and I always have the best time together and tons of laughs. A lot more happened that night, it was overall a great @NUM birthday for @ORGANIZATION. I'm glad i got to be there with her for it.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12486,21008,8," We all have had times when some thing happened and you just thought of it as a nuisance. But looking back on the same occurrence you just have to laugh at how silly it was. I recall one of these experiences when I went on a motorcycle camping trip this @DATE. It was a bright and sunny day when my dad dropped me off at the beginning of the main logging road of the area. I decided to keep my pace slow and steady and just enjoy the beautiful scenery. Later that day I found a picturesque place to camp for a few nights on the river. In the @TIME, I remembered some spurs off the main road from when I have driven with my brother in these woods and decided to go explore some of them near my camp. I decided to go check out one across the river that looked like a fun ride. As I was crossing the it my front tire hit some lose rocks causing me to fall into the water! Thankfully I fell away from my motorcycle, if I hadn't it could very well have fallen on me which, out in the woods by myself, would have put me in quite the predicament. After getting my @ORGANIZATION up and out of the water I headed back to camp to dry my clothes off, seeing as how I only brought one set with me. While reading a book and waiting for my clothes to dry I fell into a deep sleep. When I woke up I realized that the sun had been up for some time now so I decided that I had better get going on another ride before the day's out. This time I stayed on my side of the water and went up a steep road that lead up to the top of the ridge. As I climbed it became increasingly warm then I broke through the woods and witnessed a glorious sight. The sun was just cresting the ridge in front of me and I had to stop and bask in the sun shine. After a while of just sitting I got going again. The road I was on started to taper down into a valley. At the bottom of it, flood waters had washed large quantity's of silt over the road and it was still muddy. As I crossed it my wheels started spinning out and flinging mud at me as a result I ended up very dirty. Once again I headed back to camp to wash my clothes in the river. This time I didn't fall a sleep for quite some time and when I did it was a fit full one.upon waking I packed up my meager supply's and headed out to complete my journey. Most of a day got me only half way to my destination so I was forced to stop and rest for the night. Just setting out my tent and getting out some food for dinner and breakfast in the @TIME didn't take me very long. Having little to occupy my time I just sat by my fire and pondered my trip and life in general. When I fell asleep I slept soundly until @TIME. Waking to the sound of birds chirping and the river rushing by me was delightful and invigorating. It only took me a few hours to reach where my dad was going to meet me and take me home.This trip helped me think and gater my thoughts. It also helped me enjoy the little things in life that we so often take for granted. Looking back at it always makes me laugh and realize that my errors could have been much worse but as it turned out they were just minor set backs. All in all it was a very good time to gather my thoughts and renew my soul.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12487,21009,8," Laughter is a natural reaction every human being has when they are either happy or have heard or seen something that is funny to them. It is healthy to be happy other than sad or mad. Laughter is pretty much a sign of happiness, as crying is of sadness. It is just another natural emotion any person is born with. I agree to the quote someone once said about laughter being the closest distance between two people because, if two people get along, they will have many moments in life together where they are happy. It is easy to get along with people who have a good sense of humor as for they won't take everything personally and can understand a joke. Its always good to have a sense of humor because its something everyone appreciates, also, that way people can see that you like to have fun when you know you don't have to be serious. When your with a group of friends that you get along with very well, one of the main things you will hear is laughter. It shows that you get along and that your having a good time.  Of course there are times when its better not to laugh, or when people laugh for no reason, which often gets annoying. Yes laughing means your happy, but when its not needed and is used just to cause noise, it is better to be quiet than annoy everyone around you. In my group of friends we are always laughing and joking around with each other, i like when people have a good sense of humor, i feel more relaxed and its easier to talk to them. Unless, that is, they take everything as a joke and never take anything seriously. Even though it is natural, you have to know when you can and cant laugh. Its a way to show happiness, but in certain situations, it can be disrespectful or rude.  Sometimes when I'm with my friends, they @MONTH joke around about a certain person, and once it happened like this;at my friends birthday party, we all went to a bowling alley and as always, were all standing around talking and having a good time. While we were talking, @PERSON and @PERSON were joking around about something so we all started listening to their conversation. They were joking around about something and then @PERSON said something as to turn him down in some way, ask a joke, and @PERSON said that hes going to get his heart broken. Right after that was said, @ORGANIZATION pitched in, adding again. So it turned out to sound like @PERSON was going to have his heart broken again. As everyone laughed at it, @PERSON looked at @ORGANIZATION with a hurt expression and was the only one not laughing. You see, @PERSON had a girlfriend that broke up with him about two months ago, @ORGANIZATION forgot about that and didn't mean anything when she added ""again"". She meant it as a joke but it turned out to sound very mean. In this case, the laughter caused by @ORGANIZATION was meant for @PERSON, who was hurt by @ORGANIZATION's comment. Good thing @ORGANIZATION noticed and remembered about @PERSON's ex later that day. She ended up apologizing for saying something she should have thought through more carefully before saying.  How a person takes it when people laugh at them, has a lot to do with friendship. One time, my friends were driving to a party, or home from a party and were listening to music in the car, one of the guys in the car was singing his heard out to a song by @PERSON. At one point, while he was singing, his best friend suddenly turned down the volume so everyone in the car heard @PERSON sing really loud, with no music. Everyone started laughing because @PERSON didn't know that @CAPS would turn off the music in the middle of something. Even though it was kind of embarrassing, @PERSON laughed along because it was pretty funny. If @PERSON and @CAPS weren't such good friends, i think for sure @PERSON would have gotten mad at @CAPS for doing such a thing to him while there where other people in the car aside from just them two. Friends understand each others sense of humor, and know when doing something is going to far, or when the other person will think it's funny too and will laugh along. So as you see, laughter can be happy, thankful, annoying, and or mean, you just have to know when it's okay to do, and when it is better not to laugh. Even though it's a natural reaction, it is one that can be controlled and thought about before doing. Next time someone says something that's funny, first think about if it can be insulting to someone before laughing at it and hurting someone. Otherwise, enjoy life and be happy.",17,16,0.0,33,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.0
12488,21010,8," One day I decided to go over to my friend @PERSON's house. When I went over there we cleaned the pool and i ran from her dad because he was chasing me around with a booger on his finger. This was one of the days that me and @PERSON laughed more then ever!  We started the day just laying in her bad and watching a movie on her tiny @CAPS. I can't really remember what movie is was but it doesn't really matter since we were too busy talking about totally random things.  After the movie was over we went out into the living room to watch @CAPS bob because @PERSON doesn't have cable in her room. At the time, I had a knee injury so it took me a minute to get comfortable. I got myself situated on the couch and @PERSON sat next to me. Her dad came in about @NUM minutes later with a booger on his index finger. He threatened to give me booger lip, which is where he puts the booger on your lip, and I got up and tried to run away. I knew if I didn't get away he would really put in on my lip because he had done it before. it hurt really bad putting that much pressure on my knee so I hoped as fast as I could on one leg. I hid in @PERSON's closet and all I could hear in the background was @PERSON's laughter and her dads footsteps. I waited in her closet for like @NUM minutes and the got out because I could tell the coast was clear. I went back out in the living room and @PERSON and I laughed about the whole thing.  After we stopped laughing we decided to go outside and clean the pool. we were in the mood for swimming and the pool had been out all winter so it was really nasty in there. there were tat poles, dirt, some slimy green stuff, parasites and who knows what else. I wouldn't be surprised if there were fish in there. We got in and started scooping all of the water out with buckets. We didn't notice the tad poles until then. We didn't want to throw them out in the yard with all of the rest of the water because we knew that there would dry up and die. So every time we scooped a bucket full of water, we would go through it and get all of them out and put them in a little can that we had saved the tad poles and scooping all of the water out took about @NUM and a half hours. after that we went in the house and looked for some pool cleaner and soap. We couldn't find and so we went and got the shampoo. We poured the shampoo all over the bottom of the pool and started scrubbing. That was taking too long and it wasn't very fun so we got the brilliant idea to put shampoo all over our clothes and slide around. I slipped about a dozen times and so did she. It was hard to stay on our feet. We laughed so hard I almost peed myself but I couldn't go inside because I was soaked and I had soap all over my body. After the pool was all spick and span we had to scoop all out the soap and water out again. All of this took about @NUM hours but it was really and we laughed a lot. @PERSON's mom came home from work and was so happy that we cleaned it because it meant she doesn't have to do it.  After my grandpa came to get me, me and @PERSON said our goodbyes. I went home and thought about how that was one of the funnest days of my life. Over all, I think on this day I laughed more then ever before.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

12490,21013,8,I think that laughter is very important. It is very important to me because let's say that a student falls and you laugh at him just because you think its funny it's going to hurt that student. I think that instead of laughing at someone that you could be a good kid and ask him if he is ok and help him up. That shows that student that he really has a friend that cares about him alot and doesn't laugh at him and really cares about his best friend. You also can get rewarded for doing something good but to me it's really not about what I get it's the things i do to help out my peer's . I think that we should not laugh and have a positive attitude and be mature about what we do and what we say and reacact to things like laughing at someone else. I also think that if I would have fell and I got really hurt and kids would start laughing at me so thats what I learn respect the students the way that you want to be respected. So I wouldnt like people to make fun of me so why would I like to make fun of someone else if I wouldnt want them to make fun of me thats why you should treat your peers with respect.,10,17,24.0,24,0.0,0.0,0.0,24.0

12492,21015,8," The @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS extreme temperatures occur, the situation becomes very dangerous. In my case, the extreme weather was @CAPS. I lived in @LOCATION, @LOCATION at this time and was eight years old. It happened in the middle of @DATE, @CAPS an almost record high temperature occurred @LOCATION. The day had peaked at one hundred twenty five degrees @CAPS, and to make matters much worse, our entire neighborhoods power had gone out. Nobody had air conditioning and many people ended up getting severely sick or injured. We lived in a gated community, and everyone got along great. People from the neighborhood gathered together and put up tents for shade, and provided everyone with cold water. There are important things that you must remember @CAPS a situation like this happens, you must have a good attitude, because it's no help to be complaining, also to not think about the @CAPS, and to help other people who need it. I don't think that our community would have lasted, if it weren't of everyone's great attitude and spirit, and of course, the laughter. It is so important to have a good attitude during a situation like this. What is the point of complaining and getting mad for no reason? I was told that it would not last forever, and to keep my chin up. I could tell that the many other kids, and even adults who were complaining were have a much harder time coping with this situation. It was very hard for me no not complain, being an eight year-old, but I eventually managed with the help of a lot of water. If you keep your spirits up, and interact with people, the say seems to go by much faster. I remember @CAPS my whole family was under one of the tents, just sitting around telling funny stories, and telling jokes. I would have much rather had a day like that with my family than a normal, boring one. Out of the many important things you could possibly do, is to not think about the @CAPS. If you don't think about it, then you will have a much better time and not be complaining. It is important in many situations to keep your mind off the topic so you won't be stressed out. I saw many people there who just couldn't take it. They would only say how bad it was, and it was very easy to tell that they were all stressed out. If you try to make the situation a good one, and not keep thinking about it, then you will get through it, no matter how bad it is. During this @CAPS of @CAPS, many people needed assistance. The community was a big help because they set up tents and provided people with water and snacks. However, it started to get bad, people were suffering from @CAPS exhaustion, and many of them had to be put on @CAPS's. There were several ambulances there to help people out and get them back to normal. Some people did need to go to the hospital and get further attention. The community eventually got through the day with so serious injuries. The power came back on at around six o'clock. Being exhausted the people slowly walked or drove back to their houses. Our whole family walked back to the house and immediately turned on the air conditioning. Everyone was so relieved and happy that we were finally out of that situation. Even at night, the day was at a low of one hundred twelve degrees. We played games and told jokes the rest of the night and were able to get through it all. Our family had stayed strong through the @CAPS, while many others didn't last. It just goes to show that ,""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

12496,21021,8," My @CAPS year of high school started off less favorable than most. During the end of my eighth grade year I found that my friends were not as loyal as I believed they were at the beginning of our friendship, and in turn started high school without any. It wasn't all bad because I was able to see things for myself for one of the first times in my life. Of course I sulked but looking back on it now I am appreciative of this time that helped me get to know myself better. However one can't go through life without any friends so I quickly tried to conform to what was considered 'normal'. I had luck from the start, but I was still scorned from being deserted by all the people who I once considered friends and in turn took these recipients as little more than acquaintances. Like most acquaintances we only spoke in class and kept the conversation casual about nothing more than trivial facts. I wanted to have 'real' friends, but I wasn't sure what a real friend was. I suppose that these so called acquaintance considered me a friend though I can never be sure whether or not this is true. So I continued through my days with a person to talk to in each class but no one to sit with at lunch. This circumstance however was made more desirable because my sister still attended the high school at this point.  Her presence made my life slightly easier because I could confide in her and even eat lunch with her. People who have always had friends @MONTH not understand, but when you have no where to sit at lunch it can be kind of lonely. Fortunately my sister was always there for me, though she did skip a lot of school. And whenever she wasn't there I could rely on her friends to keep me company. I found that even if I couldn't find my own friends I could always share my sisters. This nomad existence continued until the second trimester of my @CAPS year. I had all knew classes and felt as if it was a new beginning and anything could happen, and truly anything I could imagine did.  It started out the same as the trimester before had. I went to my first couple classes and gained more acquaintances like usual and felt as if thing might not change after all. However after five minutes of sitting alone in my apparel construction class two girls walked in and sat at my table. Their conversation caught my attention and held it. I knew that it was wrong to listen to others conversations, but I figured that if they didn't want me to hear they would have spoke quietly. Though I can't recall the actual subject of the conversation now, I remember it was a hilarious topic. Even though I took no part in the discussion, I couldn't help but be overcome with laughter as the two spoke. They then began to laugh so hard which resulted in tears filling their eyes. In turn my eyes also began to fill with tears from the extreme amounts of laughter. One of the two girls looked over at me and told her friend out loud to ""look at her, shes laughing so hard at you shes crying!"" I could hardly stop laughing long enough to introduce myself. Before i knew it we became close friends and it was all due to the amazing powers of laughter that can bring to strangers together into best friends.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12497,21022,8," I'm going to tell you a story of smiles, laughter, and love. The story of my @DATE and how I changed the a girl's life and my own with only smiles and laughs. I have three major memories of my time with her, there was the first smile, the day at the beach, and the @TIME at the @LOCATION. Staring with with the beginning, these memories are about me and my neighbors exchange student @PERSON and they are memories, they are not perfect. The @TIME I made @PERSON smile. It was a cool @DATE @TIME out on the back lawn of grandmothers house which over looks the @ORGANIZATION gorge, perfect for watching the firework show. The lawn was even inclined so the you don't have to sit up. @CAPS and @PERSON came over to sit with me as i waited for the show. @PERSON sat to the left of me and @CAPS, my neighbor and life long friend, to the right. I was very curious about @PERSON, what she was like, what part of @LOCATION she lived in, how were her costumes different than ours. So i started to ask her some questions as we waited. I didn't get much it was obvious that she was shy, very shy. Finlay I got a conversation going between the three us us about the fire works that had started. @PERSON was telling us how the fire works back home in @LOCATION were much bigger than ours. Of course me being sarcastic i said ""@CAPS really"". She just smiled. the rest of the @TIME the conversations flowed much freer between me and @PERSON and it was a wonderful evening. Next we have the day at the beach. This happened about @DATE for the @TIME memory. @PERSON and me were good friends and she had lost her shyness and i was starting to really like her. We arrived at the beach the beach down on the @ORGANIZATION @LOCATION. It was starting to becoming a hot day, a perfect day for the beach. We unpacked the towels and other random beach stuff. Soon all of us were in the water, @PERSON, @CAPS (@PERSON's host sister), @CAPS (@CAPS's boyfriend), and me. In a bit of a flirting mood I started to splash @PERSON who happened to be by @CAPS. This started a very large splash war with every one splashing everyone else. Every one was laughing and having a great time. It abruptly stopped because everyone didn't want water in there face any more. Soon there after I dove under the water an tried to lift @PERSON up and then drop her in the water, it underlay failed though because I missed and only caught her right leg. Nothing happened, just more and more laughter. That was a good wet day at the beach. Finally, my @TIME memory is the @TIME at the @LOCATION. We had just finished eating dinner and it was @PERSON's @TIME in @LOCATION @LOCATION. By now we were practically boyfriend girlfriend. It was getting dark at @LOCATION @LOCATION as we arrived at the @LOCATION forMovies in the @LOCATION.. @TIME at the @CAPS was playing that @TIME. I found a good spot and set out the blanket. we lay there talking as we waited for the movie to start. I had a flash back of all the laughs that had brought us close together. I knew at moment that I was really going to miss her more than i had missed anyone befor. It felt like the right moment as the sun was setting over the valley, I leaned in and kissed her and she kissed right back, I'll spare you the rest. Afterward we laughed and cried. For she was leaving early the next morning and we were in love. Yes I used the @CAPS world but it was and is true. We absolutely did not want the movie to end and yet it still did. As I drove her back to her host family's house we talk about the amazing @DATE we had together and all the smiles and laughs we shared. I smiled and laughed a lot that @DATE and it did bring me very close to someone. @PERSON and I still talk nearly every day it is hard but I've never felt as close to her as any one else. I will always have the memories of that @DATE, the @DATE of @DATE, That day at the beach, and @PERSON""s @TIME @TIME in @LOCATION. I hope you enjoyed the story of my @DATE and I hope you can have an amazing @DATE ,like I had.",19,18,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12498,21023,8," Summertime is always the highlight of the year for teenagers. It's when temperatures are the highest, we are able to stay out later, and its when we have the best memories of our childhood that we will never forget. It seems like there is never a dull moment when it comes to that time of year. Everyone seems to always get together and find something crazy and fun to do. @CAPS, @LOCATION, and I were sitting at home with nothing to do and decided that we were hungry. Without us having a car, we have to walk everywhere so we chose the closest place to @LOCATION's house, which was at the time, @ORGANIZATION. We left @ORGANIZATION's at about ten o clock and started walking around, trying to find something to do. We texted @CAPS and found out that he was with @PERSON so we all decided that we wanted to hang out at @ORGANIZATION's house. We had absolutely no idea where he lived so they told us to meet them at the skate park. By then, it was pretty dark and we were still walking. When we got to the park, it was pretty late. @CAPS and @PERSON arrived a couple minutes later so we started walking towards @ORGANIZATION's house.  @PERSON has the most evil cat i have ever met. @CAPS has told me stories and showed me videos about that cat a million times before. When we got there, it was bouncing off the walls and @LOCATION, @CAPS, and I were scared of it. We didn't want it anywhere close to us because we thought it was going to attack us, eventually it did a couple of times. @PERSON was pointing the laser pointer all over the place for the cat to chase it and we were just sitting there, still bored. They were looking through our purses and saw that we had bathing suits because we went to the beach earlier, that gave them the wonderful idea of going fishing at one in the @TIME. We all piled in the car and headed for the dike. We got there in our tank tops and short shorts and it was freezing. We were huddling for warmth. We couldn't see the ground and kept tripping over little holes and tree trunks everywhere. We finally got to a little dock that looked like it was ready to break and sink at any moment. @PERSON grabbed his @CAPS fishing pole and marched his way to the edge of the dock. There was no way the rest of us could all stand on it without breaking. We were taking a ton of pictures and had a ton of fun watching @PERSON try and fish and @CAPS just being @CAPS.  In the end, we found something to do out of nothing. When people experience the greatness in little things they realize that they could enjoy everything a lot more. That night was one of the most memorable nights of that @DATE. ",15,19,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12499,21024,8,I was about ten when this story happened to me. I was with my grandma when the story happened. We were at the park and I put my head in the monkey bars. My grandma had went to the bathroom and I was stick in the monkey bars.The kids at the park thought it was funny and were laughing at me. I was really embarrassed.When I got my head out of the monkey bars I told the kids that they should try putting there head in the monkey bars. The other kids tried doing it and they all got there heads stuck in the monkey bars. The kid did not know that I had practiced putting my head in the monkey bars so that it would not get stuck. I was laughing very hard at what I had just done and when my grandma came out I asked if we could go home. The next day we went back to the park and I got some different kids with the same trick. What I don't get is if my head was stuck why would they try the same thing. The kids this time told there mom and dad what I did and they told my grandma and I got in a lot of trouble.We went home and I was grounded for about two weeks. The next time I went to the park I did the same thing. That shows that kids will be kids.,18,15,0.0,33,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.0

We could tell stories to each other that, to other people would just be stupid, but to us were hilarious. We would stay up all night long watching sad movies and laughing at each other when we caught each other crying. But that was all before the big fight. We have had fights before but none like this. I knew that the decision I would make would ruin our friendship, and take away all of our laughter, but I couldn't let her get away with what she had done. So i said goodbye. @CAPS best friends name is @CAPS, we have known each other sense we were two and have been inseparable sense then. We love to hang out and be together. That was until the fight were I was told that she had been telling lies about a boy and I. I remember the hurt and how disappointing it was to hear that she would do that to me. But I didn't care enough to ask her about it, so I ended the friendship. It hurt but I had talked myself into believing that it was all true. But something didn't feel right, something told me that it wasn't her. But I didn't want to hear it. I ignored the feeling and just went on with life. It was one of the hardest things I have ever done in @CAPS life. School was a whole other story, it's really hard to stay mad at someone when you have the same friends and a couple classes together. It was like I had to keep reminding myself ""your not friends anymore, you don't have to talk to her"", like subconsciously i didn't want to end the friendship. I missed talking to her, so one day I said hello, after that we talked nonstop, it was like nothing had ever happened between us. Except there was one thing missing, the laughter. Sense then we have become closer, we hadn't talked about the fight, but it got to the point to where we could occasionally laugh or giggle at something one of us had said, but never the kind of the laughs that we used to share. I never thought that we would have been able to speak, nevertheless be friends again.  After a few weeks we both sighed up for a youth camp. During that camp I found out the truth. We talked about the whole ordeal and came to the agreement that the whole fight had been both of our faults. Mine because I didn't want to know the truth, and her's because she didn't try hard enough to show me the truth. During that talk we shed a few tears and for the first time in about four months actually laughed together. The tension between us broke and fell of our shoulders like a very heavy pack that we both had been carrying. We both apologized for our parts in everything and then went to dinner, and laughed throughout the meal. I realize now that I can't take laughter for granted, it's a very important piece of life and you laugh the most when you are with people you love. Sam and I are still working things out between us but we are on our way to being closer than ever. We laugh all the time and never have a dull moment, we have both decided to work very hard at not having another fight between us. We have both realized that there are two very important things in life and they are friendship and laughter inside of the friendship. I love @CAPS best friend very much and I love the laughter that we share together just as much, and I don't want to lose that again. So everyday I'm going to make sure that we laugh as much as possible and I'm never going to take our friendship for granted again.",18,22,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12501,21026,8,"               Laughter is always the answer. It was freezing and dark outside. The walk home was to long to handle but the laughter that was filling the air made the walk home a little faster and shorter. The cars kept passing and stairing, but all we could do was laugh some more because we knew we were making fools of ourselfs, we didnt care one bit. The weird voices that kept coming out our mouths, the crazy @CAPS dance moves and the facial exspressions were the funniest thing to us. Stupid things that people do are the funniest things. Becasue I knew if you laugh more then usual you will build your friendship more and live your life more to the fullest. As @PERSON and I were walking back home from @PERSON we were dreding the walk home. It seemed like it was going to take two hours because of how long it took to get there when it was really about ten minutes away from my house, not even that. It also felt like we were not making it anywhere because of how slow we were walking and thinking of how long the walk would be. Cars kept passing us but they weren't stairing at us yet. It was silent until something popped up in my brain. I had the best idea so the walk would be faster. I remebered this voice my god brother @CAPS that was like @CAPS compared to me even though he is younger would always do. It always put a smile on everyone and it was entertaining. This voice I wanted to try it, so I attempted to. We weren't even half way home until I started yelling radom words at cars, it was a dark scary voice and I sounded very controlling.  Then I had the bright idea to sing in this deep creepy voice. That was a bad idea also, @PERSON started to dance and cars started to stare at us. @PERSON was this tall thin girl that was my bestfriend, she loved piercings and didn't care what others thought of her. I really didnt mind what they thought of us either because people knew we were weird. Watching @PERSON dance to my voice was the funniest thing I could ever see. I never thought something could get funnier then that, until she wanted to try the voice. When she tried the voice and it slipped out from her lips I started to bust up laughing and fell to the floor. After about ten minutes we were almost to my house and it felt like our stomachs were going to bust open because of how long and hard we were laughing. While I was thinking to myself i thought""@CAPS, that seemed like two minutes just to get home.""I knew that if @PERSON and I would just think of something to do until we got home then time would go faster. When we walked through the door of my house my mom asked us,""@CAPS were you guys dancing while you were waling down the @NUM and I just looked at eachother and laughed and told her she doesn't even know how fun it was. Laughter is the only thing that brings two people closer I think. It doesn't matter if you make fools of yourself because you know whats fun. All that matters is that you and are build a relationship together. Doesn't matter if it's just friends trying to get to know eachother more or if it is a boyfriend/girlfriend just having fun and messing around. It's always good to have that laugh here and there and no that you have that connection with the other person and no your friendship is still there. ",17,15,0.0,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.0
12502,21028,8," In the @DATE, a primary group of friends would search for different adventures to part take in. This group of people consisted of kids of all ages, @PERSON@NUM, @PERSON@NUM, @PERSON@NUM, and @PERSON@NUM. Around late @DATE, on a hot day, @PERSON got an idea to head over to @LOCATION, @ORGANIZATION and go cliff diving. He called it the ""cliffs"". So the whole group got together and took off on an hour car ride to @LOCATION. Once they got there, it only got hotter outside, and the need for cooling off was getting to be a priority. They parked, then walked the train tracks. The closer they got to they're destination, the louder the voices that they @CAPS hearing became. The spot was a secluded area with a rocky floor, people getting a running start to jump off the highest peak and go crashing on to the waters surface below. Right away @PERSON and @PERSON wanted to get settled so that they could join the others. As for @PERSON and @PERSON, it could wait. Once @PERSON and @PERSON got they're first couple jumps in, @PERSON and @PERSON thought that maybe it was time to try it. But not from the highest peak. Maybe something a bit lower. Something like the very bottom of the cliff, just for starters. Before they jumped off they noticed a little beach on the other side of the creek, so the girls conversed with the boys and they all decided to jump off at the same time, and swim to the little beach. Although they all jumped from different heights, they all seemed to arrive around the same time. For @PERSON it was a bit more of a struggle to swim that far. But @PERSON was right by his side helping him along the way. As the group relaxed in the @DATE air for a while, they became to realize that they @CAPS hungry, but much to lazy to swim back, climb up the rocks, and walk the train tracks back to the car. But hunger was taking over. As they swam back, climbed the rocks, gathered they're belongings and headed back, they started brainstorming for a place to eat. ""@CAPS going to be going through @CAPS."" @PERSON said. ""@ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION!"" @PERSON shouted. At that moment the decision was made. On the ride back, they switched drivers and sitting arrangements. Once they got to @CAPS they all stopped at @ORGANIZATION and filled they're stomach's up. They all chose to stop at @PERSON work @ORGANIZATION, to say hi to some of his friends. @PERSON was @PERSON girlfriend so they had some showing off to do. They all finished up saying they're hello's, and went back to @LOCATION house where all the cars @CAPS parked. @PERSON and @PERSON decided to shower, while @PERSON wanted to play some video games, as for @PERSON, she headed to home to shower and get ready to meet back up with her friends.  @NUM hours later, they all headed to they're hang-out spot, which they referred to as ""the spot"". They invited a couple of they're friends @PERSON@NUM, and @PERSON@NUM. They made a camp fire while the sun was setting because it grew to get colder, and colder. While @PERSON, @PERSON, @PERSON and @PERSON @CAPS sitting around the fire in chairs, @PERSON and @PERSON @CAPS riding around the camp site (which was really a huge hunk of @PERSON mom's land) on a quad. The group would take turns riding the quad but one ride in particular, made some memories. Once @PERSON and @PERSON came back, @PERSON wanted to give @PERSON a ride around. So @PERSON hopped off, and @PERSON hopped on, as @PERSON wrapped her arms around her waist, and they took off.  There was a certain trail where there was a long in the way of riding, so the driver would always have to find a way to maneuver around it. Usually it worked, this time it didn't. @PERSON hesitated to just ride right over it. She was afraid of all the power. @PERSON really didn't seem to care, and she took over and slammed on the gas. They high tailed it on the log and rolled the quad right over. @PERSON didn't weigh that much so she flew off, @PERSON on the other had got her foot caught under the handle. @PERSON got the strength to lift the quad off her foot, and @PERSON got right out. @PERSON decided to call the boys, and they hopped right into @PERSON to come save them. @PERSON flipped the quad right over and got on it and drove back behind the @PERSON.  This memory will never be forgotten with in the group, even if the group will never be the same.",17,15,0.0,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.0

Over the years there have been many difficult times, but we always managed to get through them by laughing together as a family.This past year has been especially trying, and I don't think we would have survived if we hadn't been able to celebrate the tragic time with laughter. My @CAPS stayed in @LOCATION when we moved to the @LOCATION because he was sick and didn't think he could survive the trip. Last year we finally convinced him to @CAPS up here with the rest of the family. He moved in with my family and shared my bedroom. It was hard because he snored and made strange noises in his sleep, but I was glad he was with us. When I would wake up tired from lack of sleep, I would just think about the funny noises and laugh.  Then, six months ago, my @CAPS was dianosed with a tumor in his brain. There was nothing the doctors could do for him, and they told us he only had a few weeks to live. We were devastated and I couldn't stop crying. We asked @CAPS what he wanted to do. He said, ""I want all of you to stop looking like I'm already dead and let's go have some fun!"" That was just like @CAPS. He said we were going on a trip to @LOCATION so he could go to @LOCATION before he left this world. I couldn't help laughing at how crazy he could be. Sure enough, when I arrived home from school the next @DATE, @CAPS told us we had ten minutes to grab what we needed and get in the van. He had gone out and rented a @NUM passenger van for the trip so everyone in the family could go. We just stared at him. He started laughing and told said, ""@CAPS it or you're staying behind!"" I started laughing too, and hurried inside to pack. It was the best trip of my life. @CAPS told us all kinds of crazy stories about when he was a boy. Mom wrote some of them down so we could always remember them.  When we got to @LOCATION we went on every ride in the park. @CAPS's favorite was @ORGANIZATION. He wasn't supposed to ride it because of his condition, but he just laughed and said, ""I""m sure it won't kill me."" @CAPS though it made me sad when he said it, I still laughed because he was so happy. Two months after we went home, @CAPS died. @CAPS though it has been hard and I have cried about it often, I can't help but laugh when I think about that trip and how much fun we had. @CAPS taught me that laughter can make all the difference in turning any situation around.",20,24,0.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.0,44.0

12506,21032,8,"The @CAPS is @CAPS @CAPS great grandmother once told me that laughing adds and extra five years onto your life, she's currently @NUM years old. Laughing can bring a new element to relationships; they embark on a journey, whether it be between two friends, family members, or something more. More or less, laughter is an essential piece. Sometimes you feel closer to people because it breaks down that barrier between what defines acquaintance and friends, but that's actually how I met one of @CAPS good friends.  The incoming @CAPS were participating a traditional ritual (name game) that the high school puts the incoming @CAPS through at orientation. They were placing us in long lines that faced each other. For this particular game you had to shake hands and share your first and last name with your partner along with one interesting fact about yourself. Unsurprisingly, everyone found this task ridiculous and embarrassing, but we were able to laugh if off. A whole new feeling overcame the room. That overwhelming and uneasy feeling simply floated away and all because of laughter. It broke that barrier and allowed us to open up. I guess it really is true that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS back some of @CAPS best friendships were brought up through laughter. When I joined the cross country team for instance, the whole team unlike most other sports teams was like one big family. We share socks, @CAPS-@CAPS, tee shirts, shorts, water, sometimes even our watches, but we've also shared a great amount of laughs. Even while we run we talk to our friends and joke around, but trust that laughing while running is not easy! I think @CAPS best memory of it all was when we had our ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS"". The entire team of eighteen @CAPS or so met up at @LOCATION's house about a week before districts. The @CAPS had to bring snack foods, @CAPS had to bring drinks, and @CAPS brought the candy, and the @CAPS all chipped in for the ""main ingredient"". That first bit of the @CAPS was alright, but all were in anticipation for that hour hand to strike twelve. When it did, we were @CAPS. The ""main ingredient"" to that @CAPS was the toilet paper. We were going @CAPS on a tee-pee raid!  The first event was forking the coaches lawn; but not with just any old forks, these forks were special. For some reason the coach had this odd obsession with @CAPS, so in spite of that a few of the @CAPS photo shopped his head onto the bodies of lawn @CAPS. I was in pure amazement and not laughing was impossible. I don't think I ever could have @CAPS up with something so clever.  After that little stop we were onto the main event, the tee-peeing. We tried to tee-pee one of the brother's from the team, but there dad had already been waiting up. The other pair of brother's were next. All the cars slowly approached the culdesac, we lowered the the radios and shut off all the headlights. Just to be safe, everybody made sure to park at least four houses away and left all the doors open for a quick escape. Almost synchronized, everybody threw there first roll towards the the big tree on the side of the house. We kept missing and the rolls were would fall back down and unravel into the street, one could have called us the worst tee-peers ever. Then all of a sudden three figures came bolting @CAPS on skateboards with their own rolls of toilet paper yelling, ""@CAPS! Get back here you forgot something!"". We were being ambushed! Sprinting back, we just barely made it to the cars. Still, something just didn't feel right. There was just this eerie feeling, like being in a horror movie. Then; suddenly, as we began to drive away, something big hit the car. In panic, @ORGANIZATION stopped the car and had to get @CAPS to make sure nobody had been hit. ""@CAPS get your toilet paper!"", a deep voice yelled. All the @CAPS started screaming in terror. What was going to happen now? What was even going on? Were we going to be killed? No,and fortunately we weren't killed that @CAPS! In relief we discovered that it was only @PERSON, @PERSON, and @LOCATION, but I might as well have had a heart attack. Instantaneously, the whole group burst @CAPS in laughter and I had been laughing so hard that I began to cry. I've ever laughed so much or so hard in @CAPS life and I'll ever forget it.  Laughter @MONTH not have brought just two people together, but nearly twenty. When districts came and passed, I know everyone was sad to see the season @CAPS to a close. It was the @CAPS last season and nobody wanted to see them leave; but all the great times we had will never be lost, and bonds are @CAPS. ",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

Well, I'm in high school and I usually don't have that many friends. But I have a few and one of my friends @CAPS friends with someone that I truly love. (@CAPS didn't know that) @CAPS year I was a freshmen and i went to the church with some of my friends and their was an @NUM grader that fell in the pond/water and I wasn't sure @CAPS @CAPS was @CAPS or not so I end up coming up to him and asked.Me; @CAPS you @CAPS?, do you need some help?@CAPS said; @CAPS, its @CAPS I just sprained my ankle.Me; @CAPS, see you later then.Him. Later thanks for asking though.me; @CAPS sure, @CAPS problem! The next year when I'm a sophomore I didn't realized that @CAPS was going to be their as a freshmen! his name is @CAPS I was starting to hang out with him more because @CAPS was really funny and sweet.  We went to the @CAPS ball together and our other friends were their but i was worried about of some stuffs but @CAPS made it butter because at that time i was afraid that my ex was their. @CAPS was their to help me and I also didn't know how to dance and their was a song that was on and I didn't realized that i was dancing until @CAPS told me that I was so after was dancing with him I end up asking him @CAPS I can dance with one of our friends and @CAPS said a was able too so me and @PERSON ends up dancing and @CAPS was their when I needed him. We end up heading outside and I called @CAPS @CAPS to be picked up. So, in the mean time, we were outside waiting for her. We were laughing at some jokes that we @CAPS said to each other. Like one was that @CAPS @CAPS some thing in his @CAPS and acted like that it was a wand of some sort to the school building and @CAPS asked like that it was changed to a gingerbread house. Just about a week ago I end up sneaking up behind him and scared him so bad that I end up laughing and @CAPS was too. Because @CAPS usually doesn't get freaked out like that, and @CAPS told me that @CAPS is going to get me back and I'm starting to freak out from me not knowing what it @MONTH be. @CAPS is a great help when i need him!  The thing about laughter in life is that you would need eat ether way your upset or not in the mood.The main thing that was funny from my family is that we prank each other; like my sister would step out of the room and her soda is in the room that I'm in she still @CAPS about half of soda in the can their was mustard on the table and she hates mustard form the taste of it but my dad was thinking the same thing that I was wanting to do and that was to put a little bit of mustard in her soda. When she came back to the room I was smiling and my dad was looking at me also my @CAPS. My sister ends up having some of the soda and she was looking at my @CAPS and was like;@CAPS, who put mustard in my soda? My @CAPS, @CAPS, @CAPS and myself was laughing and she hates mustard!, @CAPS it was something that I didn't like and that was put in my soda I would've done this too. So, mostly I'm trying to say is that their is some laughter that is funny. not all laughter is not funny. Its butter @CAPS you don't prank people that is close to your heart because they @MONTH get mad at you. Like my sister, @PERSON was mad at me when it wasn't me it was my dad's idea.",12,15,0.0,27,0.0,0.0,0.0,27.0

I called him again and we met up at a grade school and just sat down @CAPS a bench and started calling people to see whats up with everyone and no one would answer there phones. It became about @NUM pm when we stopped calling people to make planes, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go get something to eat, I told him sure since we had no luck for a whole @DATE @TIME. What sucks was that it was the @DATE of the @DATE, and school was going to begin @CAPS @DATE. So while we were walking to a fast food restaurant, we noticed a flier saying @ORGANIZATION @CAPS a street that sounded familiar, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go find it and see whats up and whats happening.  We followed the directions to a street that we knew pretty good, till we started hearing music bumping from a distance, so we walked -+ of a mile and saw a good friend of mine and he told me he's going to go pick up lights for a @ORGANIZATION and I asked him who's all there and he told me that I need to see for my self. So we walked around the corner of the street we were @CAPS and saw the @ORGANIZATION, we walked up to the door and saw are other friend who was standing at the door, we asked him where is everyone, we been bored all day with nothing to do @CAPS my own @CAPS and he told me that were here now and that's all that matters, so we walked in and saw everyone we called @DATE and more and they screamed @CAPS @CAPS to me and I was shocked why this @ORGANIZATION is for me and how did I get to my own @ORGANIZATION @CAPS accident. I finally found out that it was planed for me the whole time, I guess that the flier by the restaraunt was put there @CAPS purpose and my friend was @CAPS this little @CAPS to get me to the @ORGANIZATION and it was all planed from the beginning of the day for people not to answer my calls or my friends but to get me to go buy some food and to find the flier and get me to go to my own @ORGANIZATION and I thanked everyone and especially my friend who got me to go get food to find my own @CAPS @ORGANIZATION flier and we all had a good laugh, The @CAPS!",20,18,36.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12509,21035,8," My @CAPS, my friend, and myself were driving down the road on our way to pick up a mutual friend for youth group that night. Our conversation was anything but special. We were mainly just telling stories of fun times that we had already had with our old friend, and looking forward to making some new ones together. She was such an amazing person. Always ready to crack a joke, make new friends, and have a good time. Her smile was cute, and she was bale to talk someone into doing anything.  As we pulled up to her house, we were thrilled to be able to see her again. It had been weeks since the last ""play date"", and we couldn't wait to be able to catch up with her. She walked out her front door and trotted to our car. The smile on her face was enough to tell us that the feeling, of being reunited, was mutual. Getting out of the car we received bear hugs from her. Times of fun we had had together were flashing in my minds eye, and I was hoping that there would be many more that I would be able to look back on one day. We all got in the car, pulled out of her neighborhood, and started down the road. I realized that we were going the wrong way. ""@CAPS, we have to go back the other way, don't we?"" I asked. ""@CAPS, but the barrier in the middle of the road won't let me make a @CAPS turn until up the street a little ways.""she said. ""@CAPS, is that even legal?"" I asked, knowing the answer would be no. ""@CAPS, I don't really have a choice now do I @CAPS?"" I could hear the sarcasm in her voice. She could make her voice and appearance sound and look mean, but I knew that in reality, she was just messing around with me. The barrier dissipated, and she was getting ready to make the @CAPS turn. Cranking the wheel she was barely able to clear the end of the barrier, but was to late to be able to stop in time to clear the curb on the other side. She accidentally backed up onto the curb making those of us in the back seat jump, and sway, from the impact. My friends and I were all laughing, knowing that she was usually very careful, and had good driving skills. ""@CAPS everybody,"" she said. Her body language showing that she was having fun, but that she truly was @CAPS for giving us a jolt like that. Our reply was pure laughter. ""@CAPS, I guess that's our fun for the month,"" she said, her eyes sparkling with joy about making us laugh. She was always very quick to make jokes about situations we were put in.  She pulled forward, the back fender scraping the curb again as we drove off it. Driving away, my friends and I were still laughing , replaying what had just happened to us in our minds eye. It was one of our fondest memories together. A continual joke that we can just mention, and burst into laughter because of it. ""@CAPS for the ride @PERSON,"" my friends said as we got out of the car. We walked into youth group, laughing, knowing that this would be one of the many memories that we would cherish forever. Bringing us closer than ever before.",25,20,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12510,21036,8," My best friend @CAPS and I have known each other since we were two years old. We've helped each other through good times and bad, and are there for each other like chocolate on a bad day. @CAPS's best quality is the fact that she can make me laugh no matter what mood I'm in. This year @CAPS decided to go to @ORGANIZATION's, an all girls @CAPS @ORGANIZATION in @LOCATION, instead of continuing on to @ORGANIZATION like me. The first day of @ORGANIZATION, I could feel that something was missing. @CAPS. Without her cackling laugh ringing down the hallways, it felt oddly quiet. It reminded me of a place where we made most of our hilarious memories, and where we were told to ""shush"" a fair amount too. Our little brick @CAPS church!  Most @DATE's, I stood up on the alter with the priest and helped him prepare the bread and such. And most @DATE's, my best friend @CAPS was in the pews. One particular @DATE I will never forget, @CAPS thought it would be funny to sit in the front row with my family and make faces at me all throughout the mass. See @CAPS, she has the power to make you laugh just by smiling at you. When she makes faces, I usually and up with tears in my eyes. I was standing up in front of the whole congregation and was using every ounce of self control I had not to bust out laughing. The congregation must have thought I was really being changed by the @CAPS because I had the biggest smile on my face.  I'm sure you've been in one of those situations where it feels like it is physically impossible to stop laughing. You have to bite you lip, think about something sad, or try breathing excercises. Every time I glanced in her direction a new wave of giggles washed over me, and every time I glanced in my mom's direction, her evil eye burned brighter. After what felt like eternity, the choir sang the closing hymn and once we left the building, I couldn't stop laughing for at least ten minutes. I had bitten my lip so hard that there were ridges indented on the inside of my mouth. Usually after church, we walk over to the @ORGANIZATION for coffee and doughnuts. We catch up on @ORGANIZATION, and each others lives now that we don't see each other as often. She tells me about her new friends and I tell her about our old ones. I always look forward to hearing the hilariously stupid stories of her days, and I always inform her of the latest and greatest gossip from her hometown. But the thing that we always count on is a good laugh with a good friend.  Laughter keeps @CAPS and I close. If laughter really does add years to your life, we are probably going to be the two old ladies that live on the hill with twenty cats, and nobody really knows how old they are because they've been around forever. I can be myself around her and know that she accepts me because if I do something stupid I know she'll laugh and then we'll go play with her cat, @LOCATION, or make popcorn and watch @ORGANIZATION three. My family must be tired of our never-ending inside jokes. When I laugh, it feels like liquid gold is bubbling in my stomach and everything is at peace in the world. It is one of the most comforting feelings in the world. That's what I feel when I'm laughing with my best friend @CAPS.    ",21,20,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0
12511,21037,8," Shafts of light escape through fogged windows casting a shadowed glare upon the surface of the table. A tremendous sign hovers on a wide oak shelf that borders the entire dining area. @CAPS read's ""@CAPS's"" in great letters buried under decades of dust. My eyes dance among the plethora of mismatched antiques and statues strung throughout the room easily filling every crevice. These objects form a family of outliers, each individually unique belonging @CAPS the restaurant. Huge posters of All-@CAPS athletes tower among @NUM-inch flat screens while an acrid scent of molded wood and fermented beer lingers. Numerous bras fall from the ceiling of the bar that sits next @CAPS the entrance. The sound of crunching echoes in my ears as waitresses maneuver over fallen peanut shells. That's @CAPS sets this place apart from the others. The entire floor is littered with barrels of @TIME's broken shells and mashed peanuts as @CAPS is custom for the customers @CAPS throw them on the ground. Of course there's my family; a vivacious group of five squeezing our round frames into a booth that comfortably seats four. We seem @CAPS mesh quite nicely with the crowd of miscellaneous objects dressed in our '@DATE @CAPS' attire of skirts and dress suits.  Distracted, I busy myself in the menu browsing for something with a little zest and a lot of calories. A loud smashing noise breaks my attention and I slide the newspaper style menu below my eyes. Across the table sits my grandmother; a petite old lady standing proudly at @NUM who devotes her free time in attempting stand up comedy. I study the glass jar of ketchup she's holding and watch her pound the corner on a single peanut. The shell cracks open and @ORGANIZATION picks out the nuts sweeping its kernels onto the floor. I giggle @CAPS myself surprised at @CAPS limits this old lady is willing @CAPS go @CAPS. She proceeds @CAPS repeat this process with ten more peanuts until the entire family has stopped in curiosity. Looking up, @LOCATION pauses with the jar suspended in her hand. ""@CAPS? I'm just trying new ways of cracking open the nut."" @LOCATION exclaims pausing for a comical response. With no reaction we resume position contemplating our meal choices. Minutes later a hefty waitress reeking of drugstore perfume and @TIME nights hangover sets down glasses of water and drags off sluggishly. Raising his glass, @CAPS motions us @CAPS follow.  ""@CAPS!"" @CAPS calls clinking each of our glasses in turn.  ""@CAPS! And @CAPS @CAPS cherry people!"" @LOCATION pitches in. ""@CAPS @CAPS!"" I shout automatically. Immediately my parents chuckle because my grandmother has never been funny. @CAPS's a joke that nobody in the family laughs at @LOCATION's comments but herself and that's how @CAPS remains. Years ago, my brother deemed her jokes the ""@CAPS @CAPS"" because she poses as a comedian but truly isn't. From then on, each time @LOCATION would crack a ""joke"" someone was quick @CAPS respond with yelling ""@CAPS @CAPS!"" @CAPS this day, she has neither improved nor given up daily opportunities @CAPS attempt @CAPS win over her audience. In quiet defeat @LOCATION chuckles @CAPS herself and focuses down on the menu. Seconds later she's back in the ring for round two.  ""@CAPS's noon. So are we having breakfast or lunch? Or should we have..brunch?! I'm dying here just laugh already,"" she pleads. For a moment we all just stare at her. Innocent eyes gaze back; the predator calmly sits awaiting the move of its prey. Then, as if a switch had been flipped, we eye each-other and the ribbon is cut. Tea party giggles erupt into hoarse cries as rolls of thunderous laughter echo through the room. I hand my mother a napkin which she uses @CAPS dab jubilant tears. The thick wooden table shutters under the pound of my father's fist slapping the surface in hysteria. I laugh so hard my gut aches and yet I cannot understand why everything is so funny. All the while @ORGANIZATION sits in pure delight, tickled by the success of finally earning a sincere response @CAPS her notorious off-the-cut ""jokes."" @CAPS's a wonder we aren't thrown out of the restaurant. Customers in surrounding booths peer over the edge of their bench eying us with distaste. However, this isn't the first and certainly wouldn't be the @TIME time my family causes a scene. Plain yet obnoxious jokes is a loosely run comradery in our family that always finds its spot in our books of lasting memoirs. The remainder of the meal was spent in bursts of giggles and we were more than kindly shown out the door once our meal was finished.  Its when you break into hysterics for no monumented reason and can't get through retelling @CAPS someone else who doesn't find @CAPS nearly as humorous.) @CAPS's those insignificant moments in life when we're reminded of who we are and the bonds we share. Laughter is a connection, a form of love that cultivates within society and in families with grandmothers such as mine, every ""@CAPS @CAPS"" is worth @CAPS.",25,25,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0

I forgot why we went, but I think it was just because it was the @DATE @CAPS my great aunt @CAPS uncle were getting older. I was very young, @CAPS I only remember bits @CAPS pieces of the trip.

12513,21039,8," Laughter can be a very important thing in everyones life because, its something that can help you in many ways. As far as I remeber laughter has helped me get thru alot of emotional problems that I would have with alot of my ex boyfriends. One day my mom saw me crying because my ex had broken up with me and I got really upset so the only thing my mom said to me was that ""laughter was the best medican""at that point I didn't understand what she was trying to say, but now that im getting older I start to realize what she ment with that is that being bummbed about something like that is just useless, and that I had to live my life to the fullest because I was to young to cry over someone who I jst had a simple crush on and she was totally right about that. But then again its not only for boyfriend and girlfriend thing it's also to keep a healthy friendship with your friends Laughter is a way to show how you feel inside. Even when I dont feel like laughing I still do because thats a way to show people that im a strong and independent girl who knows how to take care of herself and live her life. I also try to make the people around me laugh and just have a good time when we hang out because they create the best memories. I'm accually surprised in how much a simple laugh or smile can make someone feel better and sometimes one person can make another one smile just by simply laughing at the most siplest things.   In the other hand there are people who fake laugh meaning that they just laugh but its not that they are laughin because they think yewr funny they are laughin becasue they think yewr acting dumb. But the truth is that sometimes its hard to see whose the real people from the fake because there are many people who fake laugh just to pretend that they like you when they really dont and i truly think thats dumb because you end up beliving that they are your friends when all they do is laugh behind your back. But i dont let that get to me because those kind of people are the kind that its not even worth to take your time with .When i make the people that i care about smile and just have a good time also makes me happy because it makes me feel like i've made a difference in that certain persons day, i kno i cant change their life but I can always try to make their day a little easier by just making them laugh. My little three month old sister is always laughin, always cracking up for no apperant reason and its kinda funny to watch becasue when she laughs I laugh to, thats kinda what I ment to say when i say that a simple smile or laugh from one person to another can make a difference. i mean shes only three months ans shes always happy and always has a smile on her face for no reason, sometimes without knowing shemakes my day even better when she starts laughing out of the blue which i think its somewhat cute.  My mom sometimes tries to make laugh because she knows that I sometimes have bad days at school and she tries her best to make me laugh because when i laugh it makes me forget about al my problems and everything, but i know that laughin cant always be all good, for excample laughin at other peoples pain is just bad and thats something that isnt funny and people do laugh at other people which can really hurt someone. Meaning in many ways laughin can be good or bad but that also depends in the person who is laughin..",20,16,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12514,21042,8," I personally do believe that laughter is very important in any relationship. Who doesn't enjoy laughter every once in a while? I know i do. My true story is on the relationship of my @NUM year old toddler daughter and I. I will tell you why I think laughter is important, how it is important, the part it plays in my relationships, and the benefits I believe it can have for any persons relationships. Everyone needs to smile and just laugh, forget about the things that make you frown, so you can turn it upside down. My relationship with @PERSON(my @NUM year old), has mixed emotions at all times, and is constantly changing. The emotions range from complete happiness and admiration, to anger, frustration, and a whole lot of stressfulness. Of course during all of these different feelings, I always love her with every inch of my heart. But during the midst of feeling so stressed out that I want to scream, she will say the funniest thing, or make the most adorable face. And you cant help but smile and laugh, which, let me tell you, makes all the difficulties go away for that brief moment. The most cold, angry, and hurtful people in the world, never laugh. They isolate themselves and don't have good relationships with other people. We all need some laughter in order to not be depressed and sad. If you are always frowning and stressing out, there wont be any room to look at the good things and just laugh. When @PERSON does her little thing and it makes me laugh, then she laughs and we are all in better moods. She knows that mommy still loves her, and she knows just the right ways to make me smile and i just wanna pick her up and squeeze her. Because at the end of the day, when you think about all the things that went on in your day, good or bad, there really isn't anything you can do but laugh.And that makes your whole day worth it. It doesn't have to be your children that make you laugh, it can be any relationship with anyone. Maybe its your relationship you have with your boyfriend, and you have been together for a long time, you guys laugh right? because honestly, how could you stand being with a person all the time, and saying you love them and what not, yet you never laugh with them? They never make you laugh? that just wouldn't add up..No relationship can really be a good one, unless there is some laughter. Especially if its someone that you love, and are with constantly. The good things in life, need to exceed the bad things. so, the more laughter the better. I know that parenting is super stressful, especially as a teen mom. and when she puts that smile on my face, i forget about my stresses for that moment and it makes everything better. I wanna give an example of when laughter really made a difference in my day, even my whole week. So you know when you have those days where nothing is going right, your arguing with your parents or boyfriend or whoever, and you have just been feeling like crap all day and week. You have not laughed, smiled, or done anything fun, because the past couple of days just seem to be dragging on and on with the same old routines. Then, the weekend rolls around, and i personally find a babysitter, and you go hang out with a friend or two. We all get together and start talking about old memories, both good and bad ones, ones that make you embarrassed, or ones that make you want to cry. But then you get to the story that always makes you bust up laughing, if its told the right way. And your all laughing for hours it seems(but really,its only been @NUM minutes ).Finally, your forced to stop laughing because you were laughing so hard you started crying. and your stomach hurts like you did fifty crunches, and it hurts so bad, yet you feel so good.Then we would all just lay there, catching our breathe. The only noise you hear is a little sputter of a laugh coming out of someones mouth every thirty seconds or so.. So, all-in-all, that's how I see laughter, and why I think its important in everyone's lives. When your sad, it will make you happy. And when your stressed out, it makes you forget everything bad, and just think about the good for a second. When you have had the worst week of your life it seems like, and then you finally get to have your weekend with the girls, and you laugh your heart out, you feel like a new person. Laughter is good for the soul, and it exercises some kind of muscle in your stomach too, I think. Doesn't really matter who you are, or what the issue, laughter will make you feel better, and forget the bad things.  ",20,16,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12515,21043,8,"                                       @LOCATION @LOCATION @CAPS wants to travel, and while traveling is fun, it is more exciting to go with people you love, but sometimes you go somewhere with people you @MONTH not know very well. Every two years or so, the choir at my @ORGANIZATION has an opportunity to go on a trip together. During these trips, the students are able to work with college professors, eat tons of junk food, get away from their parents, and just have a great time together. It's a experience that every @ORGANIZATION @CAPS dreams of. At the beginning of my @CAPS year of @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION, my choir director announced that we would have the opportunity to go to @LOCATION. I was ecstatic to be going, but I'm an extremely introverted person and I knew that I didn't really have any friends in the choir. I also can't walk, and was scared I would be left behind in a store because I couldn't open the doors or they would go across a street corner that didn't have a @CAPS dip down into the street, and thousands of other things that were racing through my mind. I was so terrified that that I would be separated from @PERSON, my one friend who was in choir, that I almost didn't go. I'm not really sure how, but my mother convinced me that everything would be alright, and I had nothing to fear. Once we arrived in @LOCATION, we split up into groups to see who wanted to go to explore the @PERSON and who wanted to go up @ORGANIZATION street, one of the windiest roads in the world. My worst nightmare came true, I was separated from @LOCATION. I tried to tell myself that nothing would go wrong and that the chaperons wouldn't leave me behind, but in the back of my mind I just kept coming to the same conclusion: I would be alone with a bunch of strangers in a city I knew nothing about. Somehow, I got on the bus that was slowly taking me away from @LOCATION. One of the other girls, @PERSON, came to sit by me, and attempted to start a conversation. That was one of the longest bus rides of my life. When we arrived at the bottom of @ORGANIZATION street we split yet again, one group was going to walk to the top of the steep hill and the other was going to ride in one of the old trolleys up to the top then walk down where the hill wasn't as steep. I was forced to go on the trolley because the hill was so steep part of the sidewalk contained steps, and since I can't walk, the only alternative was the trolly. Several of the other kids went with us and once again @PERSON was in my group. A couple hours later, after getting lost and turning on several wrong streets, we found the trolley station and bought our tickets. Luckily, I managed to avoid conversing with @PERSON this whole time, so the ride up the hill was enjoyable. Some of the local people smiled at us because we were so excited to be riding on the trolley. We saw houses, stores, and @LOCATION on our ride.  There were six people in our group at the time, two chaperons and four kids. Once we reached the top of the hill, two of the kids, @PERSON and @PERSON, decided they really had to go to the bathroom, so one of the chaperons, @PERSON, and @PERSON raced back down the hill to find a public restroom. This left me, alone, with @PERSON and @PERSON, who was the remaining chaperon. We walked leasiurly down the hill, @PERSON and @PERSON doing most of the talking. Every so often they would ask me a question and I would answer in as few words as possible, and that's what was going on when we walked past a group of men, arguing, in front of a store and one of them yelled, ""@CAPS, @CAPS @CAPS! Whatcha doing? You goin' to your @CAPS's house?"" We didn't really know who he was talking to, or what he was talking about, so we just kept walking, but as we reached the end of the block @PERSON and I simultaneously broke into laughter. The man was talking about me. The rest of the way down the hill we started coming up with different weird responses that I should have said to the man, each one being more hilarious than the last one, and as conversations go, we eventually got on different topics, which made me realize that @PERSON and I really did have many similar traits. We both loved musicals, we both enjoy reading, and we both have annoying, younger brothers. Ever since that day, @PERSON and I have been fairly good friends, all because we took a moment to laughed together.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12516,21044,8," I believe laughter brings many different people together. In my friendships with friends we are always laughing about random, silly, things that happen to us each day. Laughter is an important part of any friendship or relationship. One time when laughter help me out the most was the during fourth grade. Fourth grade had brought so many ups and downs with it which none of us knew it would. My friends and I had the biggest fight over the littlest reason. This fight included my best friend @PERSON, also my neighbor, @PERSON, @PERSON, and @PERSON. We all were very close until this fight which was over my favorite sport, @CAPS, and @CAPS. Everyone had their sides, @PERSON sided with @PERSON and I was all alone. @PERSON and @PERSON didn't side with anyone they just wanted us to get along. It was the hardest for @DATE and I because we were best friends and did everything together. All the students in our class knew that and could not believe we had a huge fight. @PERSON and @PERSON would try as hard as possible to hang out with both of us but somehow it didn't seem like that to @LOCATION and I. We both thought that @PERSON and @PERSON were never hanging out with us.  Soon enough our teacher and student teacher had called our parents to tell them about this fight. I remember every other day someone would go home crying. Our parents had a meeting with our teachers and principal to discuss how they can help us. They concluded with the fact that @PERSON, @PERSON, and I would being going to see a councilor. @PERSON on the other hand got out of seeing the councilor. We found this out when our teacher announced it to the whole class. As @PERSON remembers it ""That was the first time, in a long time, you and @PERSON actually talked!"" @CAPS @PERSON or I remember talking but I guess change had start to come. When we went to the councler she was very nice and talked to us in a way we all felt comfortable. She asked us what we missed most about our friendship and all three of us answered laughing. We said that we laughed every day and now we go home crying. She asked us if we liked to play games during the times we used to spend together, we answered yes. She let us play games, such as monopoly, which was really fun. At the end of the day the three of us went back to class smiling and laughing. When we entered the classroom everyone was surprised that we were actually getting along. After school I went home and my mom asked me how the councling session had gone. I smiled and said we all had a blast! The next day the three of us went back to the councler and played more games. This session also we would be writing a paper about how the fight had changed us. When we were done writing, all of us read the paper to one another. All having the same message: I wish this had never happened, I miss the laughing, and I will laugh about this fight in the future.  To most extent this message was very true. @DATE, @PERSON, @PERSON and I are still best friends. Yes, we tell this story to everyone and laugh every time. Most of our friends reactions are shocking because they cant believe we had a fight or they just laugh at how stupid the fight was. Most of our friends ask what the moral of the story was and we simply say ""don't let any little thing get in the way of your friendship and remember to laugh about the good times."" In most ways laughing about this silly fight has brought all of us closer and kept us together. Now we have more and more things we can laugh about.  Every friendship has its ups and downs and along with those comes laughter or crying. In the end the only way that you and your friends can be closer is to laugh. Never miss a moment or second guess a change with your friends. They are always going to be with you along the journey of life and laughter is the key.",20,18,36.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12517,21045,8,"Benefits of laughter Laughter has always been a big part of my life. when you laugh you are having fun. Having fun puts you in a good mood. When my friends and I get into arguments, or disagreements laughter can be our mediator. Laughter can make a bad situation slightly bearable. Laughter even has great health benefits like working out your core, and lungs. One of my best friend's mom recently passed away right before @CAPS. Her name was @CAPS. She was like a second mother to me for several reasons. I had known her for @NUM years, and for a small amount of time i even lived at her house. She was basically a mother figure to me, because i don't live with my birth mother. I use to see her almost everyday, because of my friend @PERSON. He is @NUM and we hang out just about every day. I remember the morning he called me and told me his mom was dead on the floor in her bedroom. I ran over there as fast as i could when i saw the ambulance lights. My other friend @PERSON spent the @TIME at @PERSON house the @TIME his mom died. When i made it to @PERSON's house he instantly started to cry on my shoulder. It was wise not to try and make @PERSON happy with laughter, because nothing is really funny when a loved one passes away. As time went on @PERSON and I started to think of ways to cheer up @LOCATION. We wanted to get his mind off of his mother. Wouldn't you know it the best way to do so was laughter. I'm the jokester in my group of friends. So some how i have the ability to make people laugh without thinking. I'm more of a doer not a thinker. Id rather see my friends in a good mood than in a bad mood. If people are in a bad mood there is this bad aura or vibe you can just feel it. Its a very undesirable feeling. Laughter cheers up my friends when they are feeling down. Laughter helped make a bad situation like my friends mom dying into a slightly more comfortable situation. Laughter along with trust, and respect are @CAPS bring my friends and I together.",18,19,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12518,21049,8,"                                 @CAPS @CAPS      The first time i ever heard about the sport @CAPS @CAPS was the beginning of my freshman year. I was interested in doing it but i wasn't really sure about it. Though during eighth grade i had played volleyball just for the fun of it and really enjoyed it. I had decided i wanted to play volleyball once i got into high school. But when i got into high school my opinion of still playing on the high school volleyball team changed. I realized it was much more then i expected, the people, and the attitudes i realized that if i were to play on the high school volleyball team i wouldn't have any fun. So i started to look into joining the @CAPS @CAPS team. I had finally decided to sign up and join the team. I had really hope i would like @CAPS @CAPS because it was my first year on the team and i had absolutely no idea what to expect of it.          The first day of practice, after school i went into the girls locker room, changed and took everything with me and went out to the track shed. When i got out there, i saw a lot of people i had never seen before, except for the kids in my grade and also my best friend. My coach @PERSON started to talk to everyone that was new to @CAPS @CAPS. She told us that it would be a great experience and it was a a great sport and also it was more of a individual sport rather than a team sport. But also we did many things as a team. After she had talked and discussed the basics of @CAPS @CAPS. We we're to jog our warm up lap and then stretch as a team. Then we were to start our run for the day and everyday was a different work out either a road run or a track work out. I began to really enjoy @CAPS @CAPS. At first, i was beyond sore and couldn't move at all. But as the season started to really get going i eventually got into shape and looked forward to practice after school every day. We trained and got ready for my first race which made me very nervous i had no idea what to expect my first race ever and i was so scared and nervous. But after, i had ran my first race ever i felt good and was proud of myself. @CAPS @CAPS is something i have always loved every since my freshman year when i first started to run.      One of my most favorite races we've ever done was called ""@CAPS @CAPS"" the first time i ever ran in that race was my freshman year, it was like of our third or fourth races of the season. It also happen to be the first time we had done that race in over a couple years. So i was excited for it because i had heard about it and everyone was telling me how exciting it was going to be and that i would love it, the day of the race i was once again nervous like every other race I've been too and still am every since i first joined @CAPS @CAPS. When we arrived at the destination we set up a tent, started to warm up for the each of the races that was going to happen a boys race and a girls race. We also went over the course and that's when i realized what everyone was telling me the mud pits and a huge steep hill and we had to @CAPS a river twice. After the race, i had such a great time my team and i laughed and we all enjoyed ourselves. It was so much fun, our bus rides as a team, all the fun practices. As a team we enjoyed many laughs and all the fun times we've had together. My favorite year of @CAPS @CAPS would have to be my freshman year because it was my best season, i loved it. We grew to love each other and bonded as a team. Laughter was a big part of @CAPS @CAPS we laughed and enjoyed each others company as we practices and also as we were on bus rides on the way to our meets. We had a lot of fun, and laughed often as a team and that to me was a big part of getting to know my team and being able to bond and build relationships and friendships with everybody on my team. @CAPS @CAPS is a sport where laughter is a big part of running and having fun and enjoying everyone's company, without laughter our team would not be as happy,excited, or even ready to practice. Laughter is big in @CAPS @CAPS without it our team would not have as much fun as we've had over the years.    ",18,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12519,21051,8," One of the most oddest things in life is how people can have different ways of doing things for just about anything. @CAPS what I see most is laughing. There is that laugh you do when you don't really understand your bosses joke and then there is that laugh that you do when it really isn't the ""right time."" @CAPS one of my favorite is laughing at your best friend when your crying. Sitting on the train a few weeks ago, I saw a lady with her friend sobbing about how her boyfriend just recently broke up with her. Quietly turning over my shoulder I try to hear more of the story. Her friend nodded and comfort her. @CAPS then said something about how gross it was when he ate. Sort of like a cow eating grass. As soon her friend said this the girls face blushed and she giggled with laughter. @CAPS still her eyes were red as she sniffled a little. @CAPS a slow smile washed over her face. The woman had more of giggle then a laugh. @CAPS you could tell the girl was going to be okay because she had someone to make her laugh and remember life is more then just a guy. I thought for a second how this happens more then you think with my best friend. I feel like now even that seven years have gone by it never gets old when we bust out laughing. Most of the time it's something stupid and we are just strangely thinking the same thing. @CAPS then there's other times where it will be like the lady's behind me. One of us is upset and we know the perfect thing to say to each other. Friendship is like that. And laughter is the medicine to any problem.  After watching the two woman I turn in front of me seeing now a teenage boy and girl. The girl looks slightly nervous as she keeps smoothing her skirt out. Then the boy who keeps shaking his knee up an down. And you can tell he's trying to think of something to say while he keeps taking quick sips from his water bottle. The girl finally pointed out the window and said something about when she was a girl she would play soccer there. He looked where she was pointing and said he thought he maybe played baseball there one time. She nodded her head and they got silent again. The train came to it's next stop jerking a little making the boy spill some of his water on his pants. The girl quickly pulled some tissues out of her purse giving them to the boy. His cheeks flushed with red as he started to chuckle and explaining how nervous he was and this wasn't going to help. The girl stared at him and quickly started to smile. Then they both began to look at each other and started to laugh. The boys laugh was deep and echoed across the train the girls was contagious @CAPS sweet. Now the ice had been broken because of one awkward moment and had them both talking and laughing. This was the start of could maybe be even young love. I smiled and rested my head on the window. Watching the trees blur by. I knew how our world is always talked about being so melancholy @CAPS I think people forget moments like this. It's those brief seconds with another human relating to you. Making you laugh and caring enough to try to make you feel better that keeps our world from completely going insane.  The train slams and starts to slow down as it comes to a stop. I slouch my bag on to my shoulder and get off the train. As I step outside I feel the cool air kiss my cheeks. I looked around see people hurry by me looking for their next bus or person to pick them up. I sit down on the bench and watched the teenage couple holding hands as they walk by me. As they smile and talk everything suddenly goes dark. I throw my hands up to my eyes connecting with another big cold hands. I snap around to see the person who had blinded me. It was my dad smiling ear to ear. I stood up on the bench and hugged him as I started to laugh. My laugh was high pitched @CAPS muffled in my dads coat. This was the best type of laugh to me. No action was funny or a friend saying something @CAPS because your so happy sometimes you just have to let out a little bit of joy. You just laugh, not for any reason @CAPS because your happy. And then in that second everything bad or what you stressed about goes away. Maybe just for a little awhile @CAPS it's still something that could make your whole day better.",27,18,42.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0

But I never laughed as hard as I did the day my friend @CAPS and I were waiting for our friends @LOCATION, @PERSON and @PERSON to come back from getting @PERSON from @LOCATION to come down and hang out for a little while. @PERSON had to wait at my house for them to get back, on the way to my house I'm thinking what in the world am I supposed to do with @CAPS all alone? @PERSON and I always have a lot of fun hanging out with each other but we always have people around when we do hang out, I anticipated when @PERSON got there cause I couldn't think of what me and @PERSON could do when we were at my house with out @PERSON and @PERSON being there. We couldn't hang out in the house because my @CAPS had a cold, so we had to go outside in to the shop which is also called a garage, and hang out together until @PERSON and @PERSON got @NUM finally showed up and I didn't feel as sick as i thought that I would when she got there, she got out of the car and came in, we went straight to the shop and got started on trying to find something to do, @PERSON suggested that we sat down and just talked, I was up for anything as long as it was fun and didn't involve going anywhere at @NUM: @NUM @CAPS clock at night. I sat there and asked her about her life was she happy, did she hate living in @LOCATION and a lot of other stuff. but then the ultimate topic of conversations came up... T.V. commercials. we talked about all of our favorite @CAPS commercials and why they were our favorite, I told her my favorite commercials of all time were the freecreditreport.com commercials, the old ones not the new ones, and that the reason i loved them so much was because they had real life situations in them that made them very easy to believe but they were also sort of hard to believe cause i don't know anyone who has had to work at a restaurant dressed as a pirate because of identity theft, or someone who has had to buy a really cruddy car because their credit score was whack, and I've also never heard of a used sub compact? Any-who @CAPS said that her favorite commercial was a car commercial that had dancing hamsters in it telling you which car would be the best choice to go with, @CAPS was describing the commercial to me and actually started dancing in the middle of my garage. It was quite funny but at the same time some what disturbing. @PERSON is a really good friend even if she is a little goofy sometimes but the best thing about having @CAPS is knowing that when ever i need a really good friend i have @CAPS after the whole dancing bit i knew what i wanted to while @CAPS was there... I wanted to be crazy and hyper I wanted to be so full of energy the world fastest runner wouldn't be able to keep up with me! I went into the kitchen and downed some sugar and got about as hyper as @CAPS, only less, then the time almost flew by before we knew it @PERSON, @LOCATION, and @PERSON were there we couldn't believe it. @PERSON got out of the car and the first person he gave a hug to was @PERSON of course, then he gave me a hug, then @PERSON, then @PERSON. I hadn't seen @PERSON in so long it was like we had never met before. @CAPS showed everyone her dance and the song, everybody laughed so hard i thought they were gonna pass out I had a lot of fun that night mostly because of @CAPS, she was very nice she was funny and she kept me thinking about other things then what was on my mind at the time @CAPS was a big ball of hyper that night, I thought that it was funny. We were just standing there in the shed and she goes ""mouse"" and I scream and jump up on to a chair and scream ""@CAPS!"" @CAPS reassures me that it was in the rafters and couldn't come down and get us so for the rest of the time we just acted like he wasn't even there I'm really lucky to have @CAPS and I'm really glad for the day i worked up enough courage to go over and say hi to her that day in art cause other wise id be lost @PERSON is the best friend a girl could ever ask for and I was fortunate enough to get her for my best friend.

12521,21053,8,"I live in a life full of laughter, I can not think of a day that I have not laughed. Even when I went threw the hardest days of my life a little @DATE, there was still someone to make me or a reason to laugh. I think laughing is the best medicine for a person. If you are someone that can go a day without laughing, I'd love to meet you and make that change! There are a few particular times I can remember that we're just full of laughter, most involving family and friends. The first one that I can remember was when my parents showed me a picture of when I was a little girl, there are many laughing episodes when it come to me as a little kid. The picture they showed me was when it was @DATE time and I had no shirt, just shorts on. I was sitting on a sled, facing uphill, with the sun just shining. I can not explain how hard my family and I laughed together just from looking at one picture. Another laughing moment I can remember was not when it happened but when I look back now all I can think to myself is, wow. I was about six @DATE old at my best friends house who owned eight lamas, who got to get tied up in the yard everyday. The one I always got to walk was named, @CAPS. @CAPS was sweet, @CAPS I though, until one @DATE day she decided to drag me across a highway. While I was getting drug across a highway that was usually busy, all I could here was people yelling ""let go of her lead!"" @CAPS me being six I thought if I let go that the lama would get hit by a car or never come back. I regretted not letting go once an adult got to me because I was all scraped up and blistered from being drug across the pavement. That is a time in my life I will always look back and laugh, but never forget. The last one, my favorite times in life. This would be pretty much anytime I am with my boyfriend. Favorite time was our trip to the beach for the first time. We had never been there together but, it was amazing! We attempted to ride bikes on the sand, failed, and just laughed about it. Then we decided to just walk around all the beach stores and see if we could find something we might have wanted to buy. Later that day we just went to the beach, walked and felt amazing. The funny part of this trip was when we we're trying to take pictures of each other jumping in the air with the ocean behind us. People were looking at us like we were crazy but, we didn't care because we were having fun and laughing almost the whole time! I think that laughing is a very important part of everyday life, to everyone. If you don't laugh at least once in day then something is wrong. I love looking back at pictures from when I was little, having memories with best friends and their animals, as @CAPS as taking trips and just being with my boyfriend.

12522,21054,8,"Laughter is the @CAPS @CAPS't @CAPS frustrating when you can't manage to get someone to laugh? Is @CAPS really possible to be so upset that you can't even crack a little smile? There's something to laugh at in every situation, sometimes @CAPS just takes some thinking and imagination to figure out what @CAPS is. I personally had an experience where laughter was all I could look to in order for me to feel like everything was okay. Last @DATE, I was babysitting, @CAPS was a nice and sunny day and we were all craving chocolate frostys from @ORGANIZATION. At the time I could not legally drive anybody outside of my family, so we decided to call my sister, @LOCATION. She had the day off work, so @CAPS seemed to be a perfect day for frostys. We waited for what seemed like forever for @PERSON to get to the house and finally, after about an hour, she pulled in the driveway. The kids were so excited. The four of us loaded into the back of @CAPS car and off we went to @ORGANIZATION. When we got there, we started getting out of the car and that's when I noticed something was wrong. @PERSON had just locked the keys in the car, with the keys still in the ignition and the car running! I was still getting the kids out of the car so you'd think that I would just reach in and grab them, but no, that was not the case here. I asked @PERSON ""@CAPS did you leave your car running? Aren't you going to get your keys?"" @CAPS response was, ""@CAPS, no! I locked @CAPS too! Don't close your door!"" @CAPS was too late. I instinctively closed the door after i was done. I hadn't really thought about the fact that I could have saved all of this from happening, especially considering that I was the one that noticed @CAPS first. Apparently I don't listen to people's responses after I ask them a question because the kids were all practically rolling on the ground because they were laughing so hard and I couldn't figure out what was so funny. Then @CAPS hit me, I felt like an idiot. We were stuck in the @LOCATION's parking lot with three kids, locked outside of a car that was running and we didn't really know what to do from there. Our first solution to the problem was to call my mom and have @CAPS bring the spare @CAPS, but we weren't really sure where the spare @CAPS was at the time. My mom said that she didn't have @CAPS so we would have to call my dad and ask him where @CAPS was. We called him and first he laughed at us for being so stupid, but then said the @CAPS was in his truck and somebody would have to come get @CAPS from him because he was about to go into a meeting. Obviously we couldn't go get @CAPS from him, so we called my mom back and she agreed to go get @CAPS, though at this point she wasn't very happy about having to leave work to fix our stupidity. She told us to not worry about the car, nothing was going to happen to @CAPS with @CAPS locked, and just go inside @PERSON's and get our frostys. Through all of this @PERSON and I were just trying to keep the kids entertained, but they didn't really need us for that. They were too busy role playing me closing the door while @PERSON said not to. They thought @CAPS was hilarious. @PERSON and I were not so humored by @CAPS, although we did think @CAPS was pretty funny to watch them exaggerate the whole thing over and over again. Instead of us making the kids laugh, they were making us laugh. We sat at @LOCATION's for almost two hours before my mom showed up with the @CAPS. @CAPS turned out that the @CAPS was not in my dad's truck like we thought, @CAPS was at our house, hanging on the board with all of the other spare keys. That didn't matter though, all that mattered was that we get the kids back home before their mom showed up with us not there. The car sitting there using up the gas with nobody in the car was not the funny part of the day, neither was @PERSON blaming me for everything and making me fill @CAPS tank with all the money I had earned that day from babysitting. The funny part was the kids. Still today, they laugh about our little @PERSON's adventure. @CAPS just makes me realize that @CAPS's all kids that bring laughter to the world and encourage happiness in everyone. I believe everybody needs a little laughter in their day, even if they think @CAPS's the worst day ever. Laughter really is the @CAPS.",20,23,0.0,43,0.0,0.0,0.0,43.0
12523,21055,8," Laughter is a huge part oh building friendships, relationships, and partnerships. Laughing is the first thing you learn to do you are born knowing how to laugh its the only thing that you are born to know how to do. Laughter for me is what starts a friendship if I can make someone laugh we are already closer then when we first said ""@CAPS"". As an example when I started working at the daycare i am at now when I got the other teachers to laugh you can just tell its there way of excepting you as part of there crew.  On the first day of work I walked in the the daycare nervous they sent me to the preschool classroom. I am pretty sure my boss could tell I was nervous and it made me laugh. It made me feel welcome to be there and like we could be friends. The children in that class room made me laugh the things they did. well working with children you find out if you can make them laugh or if you laugh at there jokes they are more inclined to trust you and with that you can make them feel comfortable around you. Having someones trust is sometimes hard to get but if you get it from the very beginning its easy to keep but also very easy to lose. When someone is down in the dumps making them simply laugh can make everything better laughter is like medicine in makes you feel better when nothing else can. Its safe to say making people laugh comes natural to I am just good at it and jokes come easily. When you laugh it makes everything better. Laughing is actually health and is a form of excursive.  When I am at work and kids laugh it makes me feel better even if I am having the worst day ever. When I am around people that are happy it makes me feel alot better about myself. Its even better when its babies that laugh becasuse they are so cute when they do it.",15,20,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12524,21056,8,"Laughter, @CAPS and @CAPS on an @CAPS @DATE @CAPS  One of my favorite @DATE traditions is the visit to the house of our @CAPS, the @CAPS. They live on eighty forested and meadowed acres outside of a quaint, old town. Their small green house overlooks brown fields and a blue pond, with tall trees forming a backdrop.  We arrive midmorning. We either find our @CAPS in the house or encounter them tromping out of the woods to meet us, shovels, chainsaws and other trailbuilding implements in their hands. After the customary hello, how have you been, we often wander around the yard, exclaiming at the new fruit trees or hearing stories about the latest tenants of the birdhouses.  During the hottest part of the @CAPS, we head for the shade of the lush @ORGANIZATION woods. A short walk will bring us to a trail. I love walking among the sun-streaked ferns and fallen logs, treading carefully the rickety bridges over burbling streams, bouncing confidently on the sturdy new bridges, and trying to avoid the dogs as they galumph in and out of the water. @PERSON knows all about the flora and fauna of the region, so we get a constant stream of knowledge as we hike. He also, of course, has to tell us about the trees he's planted -- a redwood here (look how well it's doing! A foot since last fall!) and a douglas fir over there (not as well. That big redwood is shading it too much). One of the best parts of the hike is when we see the dead-end section of trail that my family helped construct three years ago. We always walk to the end of it and discuss where it could go from there -- over the stream or beside it, or up the hill and if so, where would the switchbacks be? could you really bike up a trail like that?  After our walk, we arrive back at the house, sweaty and talkative. Then it's time to put on swimsuits and jump in the pond! They recently built a dock that we can jump off of -- a great improvement over wading in from the edge. We swim for the majority of the @TIME, racing from one end of the pond to the other, splashing on innertubes, having pondweed-throwing battles. Finally we get tired and sit by the side of the pond, drying off in the warm sun.  By @TIME, dinner is ready. Laura usually makes salmon, accompanied by a plethora of delicious side dishes. We drag chairs out to the hill above the pond and enjoy a leisurely supper. From the hill, we can see turtles and birds on the pond, bugs over the fields, and more birds swooping through the air feasting on the aforementioned bugs. After the meal, we haul chairs and dishes back to the house and sit on the porch into the @TIME.  @PERSON's favorite part of the @CAPS is at dusk, when the sun is at just the right angle to show all the bugs swirling through the air. At one point, all the bugs gather together and create a tornado, twisting upwards into the darkening sky, and then -- they're gone, until the next @CAPS. It's an incredible spectacle; thousands of tiny insects disappering at one swoop.  The best thing about these days is the friendship and comradery we have with this wonderful family. The parents knew each other long before us kids were born, so we have a lot to talk about; @PERSON is very interested in science topics, and he always finds a way to bring up the latest article he read. And, as with all great @CAPS, we laugh constantly. I consistently get hiccups at least three times just when we're lounging on the porch after our busy @CAPS. Even on the most serious topics, my dad or the @PERSON boys can find a joke to make, usually ""politically incorrect"" but always very funny.  Now don't even get me started on the @DATE camping trips, winter ski trips or autumn cider pressing we do with the @CAPS. ",24,24,0.0,48,0.0,0.0,0.0,48.0

I glanced over at @CAPS and then back at @LOCATION. ""@CAPS on! @CAPS can say @CAPS! @CAPS can't hear us,"" @CAPS whispered. @PERSON's whispers weren't exactly as quiet as @CAPS thought. @CAPS could probably hear everything we were saying. I glanced over at her again, and I noticed behind those cold eyes, @CAPS seemed kinda lonely and sad. I guess @CAPS's possible, @CAPS has been the talk of the whole @NUM grade class since @CAPS arrived about @NUM days ago. ""@CAPS hello! Taylor? Are @CAPS there?"" @CAPS was now in my face and view of @CAPS.  ""@CAPS does look @CAPS on the outside, but maybe @CAPS is actually a nice person,"" is @CAPS I said, but I knew @CAPS would not satisfy @PERSON at all. ""@CAPS? Definitely not. Her parents probably belong to some mafia or something. @CAPS gives off that type of aura."" ""@CAPS shouldn't judge someone @CAPS their looks,"" I responded. @PERSON gave me @CAPS sort of confusing look. ""I mean, @CAPS never know unless @CAPS ask.""  ""@CAPS if your such the expert on @CAPS why don't @CAPS go sit with her at lunch, and ask her."" @CAPS man. There was @CAPS way I could possibly do that. I know I @CAPS said not to judge someone @CAPS their appearance, but @CAPS looks like if I even open my mouth to speak to her @CAPS will kick me in the shins. @CAPS a predicament @CAPS is. ""@CAPS't @CAPS the one who wants to get to know her? @CAPS ask."" @CAPS one won't @CAPS past @PERSON either. ""@CAPS? @CAPS way. We already decided @CAPS were going to ask. @CAPS can't @CAPS back with the same thing,"" @CAPS argued. @PERSON is a very stubborn girl, and though @CAPS likes to pick on me, @CAPS really is a nice person. Also, despite her obnoxious exterior @CAPS has a lot of friends, unlike myself who is shy.  ""@CAPS,"" I muttered. I had to give in. @CAPS matter @CAPS I say, I am going to have to face @CAPS.  ""That's @CAPS I thought. @CAPS's a good opportunity to make a new friend. I am @CAPS helping @CAPS out."" @CAPS had @CAPS mischievous grin on her face. I glanced over at @CAPS one last time, and then at the clock. @CAPS was @NUM in the morning, give or take a minute or two since I am nearsighted, but lunch is at @NUM.  I couldn't pay attention at all during class. I was too busy playing out possible scenes that might occur at lunch. Maybe @CAPS isn't mean, maybe @CAPS is actually nice, and people are @CAPS misunderstanding, including me. That aside, I don't even know @CAPS to say; I can't @CAPS casually walk up, sit down in front her, look her in the eye, smile and say ""@CAPS. How are @CAPS?"" The impossible is @CAPS impossible and people should @CAPS except @CAPS, in fact @CAPS should actually be a fundamental law. I looked over at the clock again, @CAPS was now @NUM and still ticking. ""@NUM minutes,"" @PERSON said in some type of singing tone. I sighed. ""@CAPS? I kept watching @CAPS during class. Looked like @CAPS were going to jump through that window and run away at any second."" @CAPS laughed. My seat was @CAPS the window, and that option had not slipped my mind. ""I have @CAPS clue @CAPS I am going to say,"" I finally said.  ""@CAPS say anything that won't offend her. Ask about her hobbies or @CAPS @CAPS likes. Talk about school even,"" @CAPS replied. ""@CAPS's time. Go."" @CAPS piled out of the class room and in to the cafeteria. After I got my lunch, I started walking toward the table @CAPS was at; @CAPS one was around her, @CAPS surprise there.  ""@CAPS, @MONTH I sit here,"" I asked. My voice was kinda shaky and I thought I was about to have a heart attack from nervousness and from surprise at @CAPS @CAPS said. ""@CAPS all means, go ahead,"" @CAPS smiled. Wow, @CAPS is really cute when @CAPS smiles. I smiled back and sat down. I created a conversation @CAPS introducing myself and asking how @CAPS was and how @CAPS liked @CAPS school. To my surprise we actually shared a common interest, and bonded. @CAPS was laughing. I was laughing. We were laughing together.  After that day, and even still today we are the best of friends. That slight feeling of laughter is @CAPS so nostalgic, @CAPS's almost indescribable. @CAPS something so minor such as laughter, or even a little giggle, can bring anybody together to form a simple bond, friendship. Laughter is truly an essential part of life.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12526,21058,8," It is often said that laughter can bring people together. I hold that knowledge to be true. We've all laughed at one point in our lives, whether it was in a group of people, or just laughing, and having a @CAPS time. Reality is we are all connected to each other in one very simple way, we all have laughed in our lives. Laughter to everyone means something different. To @CAPS laughter can mean that I'm happy and full of life and other times it can simply mean that I feel I really don't know @CAPS to do. There's one time though that it meant both. It was a cold, and rainy @DATE day in @DATE. I was with my friends watching movies. When I'm with my friends typically that means we're talking about the latest thing, guys, hair, and whatever else. ""@CAPS my gosh @PERSON!"" We heard @PERSON scream as @PERSON and I walked into my room. ""@CAPS boy."" I thought, ""@CAPS we @CAPS again. I new it would be a mistake to have both of them @CAPS at the same time."" @PERSON and I exchanged glances, I new she had the same thought going through @CAPS head.  ""@CAPS, @CAPS happened this time?"" @PERSON sighed as we entered the room only to see the two of them going at each other, violently tugging each others hair, slapping each other, @CAPS did everything imaginable to each other before I lost it. I hate seeing my friends @CAPS at each other the way @CAPS were. ""@CAPS!"" I finally yell. ""@CAPS's @CAPS we're going to do. You,"" I pointed to @PERSON, ""@CAPS and sit over there."" @PERSON walked out of my room and sat down. ""@CAPS, @CAPS. @CAPS can't you two just relax and enjoy this time and act like you two are friends? For at least another six hours?"" I looked at each of them, @CAPS nodded in response. ""@CAPS, @CAPS lets @CAPS finish the rest of this movie, or play a nice quiet game."" I sighed, hoping the worst was over. @PERSON walked back into my room, and laid on my bed, we continued through the movie peacefully. ""@CAPS't @CAPS @CAPS just a comical genius?"" @PERSON said starring at the screen. We started laughing at @CAPS because @CAPS eyes seemed to be stuck on only him. ""@CAPS my gosh @PERSON!"" @PERSON said laughing. ""@CAPS who's calling who crazy?"" @CAPS and @PERSON both looked at each other and started nervously chuckling. The tension in the air was almost to thick. @PERSON had on @CAPS game face for that comment.  I leaned over to @PERSON and whispered, ""@CAPS this is not going to be pretty."" We started preparing for the worst. ""@CAPS grab @PERSON's arm and drag @CAPS if you have to, out of this room."" @PERSON jumped to @CAPS feet and got @PERSON out of the room, with just enough time for @CAPS to pin @LOCATION to my bed. When @CAPS had left and the door was closed I let @CAPS up but kept myself between @CAPS and the door. ""@CAPS, @CAPS is going on with you two?"" I nervously asked @CAPS.  @PERSON started to laugh a sort of villainous cackle that sent chills running down my spine. I couldn't help but give out a scared sounding chuckle, that only influenced the situation more. This could only mean one thing, my original intent, to not invite one of them, had just been confirmed, we were in for it. I slowly started backing away and headed out of my room to see @CAPS @PERSON had to say, since I never actually got anything out of @LOCATION. I inhaled and headed down the hall to them. ""@CAPS @CAPS's going on? You two haven't ever had this big of a fight before."" @CAPS started flowing down @CAPS cheeks, like a stream flowing steadily down a hill.  ""I...I don't know @CAPS h..happened."" @PERSON said still weeping. ""I j..just wanted to a..ask @CAPS @CAPS ha..happened today."" @CAPS and @PERSON's faces just had that looked of, @CAPS happened that we missed.  ""@CAPS did you mean when you said @CAPS happened today?"" I asked. I was at a loss of words when she gave @CAPS @CAPS response. ""@CAPS that's all that happened? You two were going to rip each others hair out over a guy?"" @PERSON looked at @CAPS and simply said yes. ""@CAPS come in @CAPS."" All three of us walked inside. I sat on the bed next to @LOCATION, @PERSON was in the middle protecting @PERSON. ""@CAPS, this is pointless. @CAPS you both like the same guy. Big deal get over it! @CAPS just make things more complicated anyway."" I looked to both of them, @CAPS streaming down both their rosie cheeks. ""@CAPS can we just forgive and forget?"" @CAPS filled the room. @PERSON crawled over, the metal frame of the bed squeaking as she did. ""I'm @CAPS sorry, @PERSON. Can you forgive @CAPS?"" @CAPS face tear stained and red eyed, @PERSON was @CAPS to reply. ""Of course I forgive you."" @CAPS hugged with @CAPS still streaming down their faces.

12527,21059,8," Laughter is one of the most important elements in one's life. If you're down, one smile, or laugh, causes your body to send messages throughout you body making you feel better. Scientists also say that it takes more muscles to frown than smile. I believe that this is true, because in order to frown, you have to make your whole body look like it's frowning, like your shoulders and your face, but only a little smile shows people that you're happy. In that way, my family is extremely beneficial to each other. Everyday when we're having a conversation, someone will bring up a story, or movie quote that they were reminded of and say it out loud to everybody with just the right accent so that it sounds exactly like the movie, and cause everyone to laugh. For example, every now and again, my brother or sister will bring up a quote from @PERSON or @PERSON, two comedians we really enjoy listening to, and every person in the room would pitch in with hilarious quotes they said and this could go on all night. Or, a little while ago, my favorite movie wasGet @CAPS because it was quite entertaining, so we would have rampages over supper or just randomly in the kitchen quoting that one movie for at least half an hour and the room would be filled with non-stop laughter. On the other hand, someone will make a random comment because they heard wrong, or just don't understand. Like when we were having a dinner party at my house. My family and our guests were sitting at the table just finished eating when we got onto the topic of @CAPS @CAPS because my little sister was learning about them in school. We verbally completed the train of ""Which @CAPS ruled @CAPS, who they came from, and @CAPS they're other names were"". But according to my little sister, we missed one. So, out of the blue comes ""@CAPS about @CAPS?!"". Her intentions were about the @CAPS, but I believe everyone in the room heard ""@CAPS about @CAPS @CAPS?!"", until we paused for a second and processed @CAPS she meant, and we all laughed and she had no idea why until she stopped to think about it herself. Our family has good times filled with laughter and jokes, but there are also a few very depressing times. About four years ago, an incident happened with my next door neighbor that caused him to be brutally attacked and pass away on our door step. He was very dear to my family and the rest of the cul-de-sac we live in, and for him to die like that was extremely unexpected and terrible to wake up to in the middle of night. After that, there was a period of not very much laughter and fun because we were all haunted by this horror. But, we all knew that his spirit was there to protect us, and so whenever we thought of that, there was a gap between the mourning of his loss, only to be filled in with happiness and laughter. I believe that my family and I have a really tight connection between each other, because we're so funny. There's never any stress between us, but always a calm sense of familiarity and bonding. Someone once said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I believe that, whoever that person is, is right. Even between two strangers that run into each other on the street, if they stop and have a conversation, and one person cracks a joke causing them both to laugh, it's the spark to an immediate connection, and they could become friends for a long time. This is one of the most important values that people have, and most people overlook how much it really matters to humanity.",20,25,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12528,21060,8," The human brain is a piece of work. Its the kingdom to our lives. It infuriates us, guides us, helps us and destroys us. Our brains can make our bodies feel anything it wants to. Its really something else. One of the most valuable things are brains are capable of is a sense of humor. Laughter. The ability to not take life to seriously for a moment. That light switch in @CAPS body that causes @CAPS brain to reach a state of uncontrollable happiness. Laughter is our brains only way of coping with the world. Scoping out the comical events life has to offer us. I am personally one of those people that finds everything in life funny, or will find a way to make it funny. I am hardly ever serious nor take things seriously. The same with my friends, we are always the people having a good time because we make life interesting. Maybe its our gnarly facial expressions we exchange one another, or we @MONTH just be funny looking. Either way we have a sense of humor. That's @CAPS life is about, @CAPS @CAPS happiness with people who fill @CAPS life with joy. @PERSON said, ""live simply, so that others can simply live."" I @CAPS we all can with a little sense of humor. Last year a couple friends and I went to mission ridge for a weekend to go snowboarding. We had it made, our own hotel suite with two king sized beds and a plasma @CAPS. @PERSON and I slept on one bed and @PERSON on the other. We all have always gotten along perfectly and have shared the biggest laughs together. Nothing could come between any of us. Other than a little midnight prank. On the second night at the hotel, @PERSON fell asleep first. @PERSON and I were watching some ghost movie that bored us to tears. @PERSON was eating a bag of pop corn and started throwing little kettle pieces at @LOCATION, trying to wake him up. ""@CAPS, I have the funniest idea."" @PERSON whispered over to me. ""@CAPS?"" I mouthed back lazily. Without a word @PERSON jumped out of bed and ran into the bathroom. She returned with a tube of @ORGANIZATION tooth paste, a sack of coins and a package of peach rings. ""I had nothing to do with this."" I stated, continuing to glare at the television set. @PERSON began squirting out tooth paste onto @PERSON's arms, she ran the creamy solution down his legs, back up to his face and into his hair. She stuck quarters, dimes, and penny's into the minty cement, along with the sugary peach rings. ""@CAPS is going to kill you."" I gasped. ""@CAPS @CAPS wont! It will be hilarious."" @PERSON blurted and then plopped back onto the hotel bed, admiring her work. @PERSON then picked up her bag of popcorn and resumed throwing pieces of kettle at @LOCATION's face. The next morning was not how @PERSON planned. @PERSON woke up alright, but did not have the expression on his face @PERSON intended on. ""@CAPS done for @PERSON!"" @PERSON hollered. @PERSON smiled, still convinced this was all a joke. I saw the fury in @LOCATION's eyes. @CAPS was beyond irate. His body crusted over with dried tooth paste. Quarters, dimes and penny's drilled into his skin and peach rings dangled moldy off his legs. @PERSON rushed into the bathroom to look into the mirror. @CAPS stormed back into the room with a shampoo bottle clenched in his hand. @PERSON turned to face him and her smile disintegrated. ""@CAPS are you gonna do with that shampoo bottle?"" @PERSON questioned, confused. @PERSON grew closer to @PERSON, she backed away slowly, not quite sure @CAPS his intentions were. They both switched positions, her back now facing the door and @PERSON across the room by the window. @PERSON raised the shampoo bottle over his head. ""@CAPS fast."" @PERSON shouted and chucked the bottle as hard as @CAPS could at @ORGANIZATION's face. But sadly, @PERSON ducked just in time for the bottle to miss her face and create a nuclear explosion on the door behind her. Blue liquid spewed out all over the walls. There was an indent of where the bottle hit the door. @PERSON's whole back side was covered in blue sludge. I hopped out of bed and ran to the entrance where the explosion took place. @PERSON reached @PERSON and immediately burst into roaring laughter. @PERSON sat down in a puddle of shampoo and ruptured in chuckles. I stood there, smiling at them. @PERSON still crusted over, @PERSON covered in blue goop that looked like someone threw up a blueberry smoothie on her back. I sat down with them, we all starred at each other without a word. everything was fine. It then occurred to me that @CAPS matter @CAPS we do to each other, enrage or try to explode one another, we will always find a way to laugh about it. A sense of humor is merely our souls telling us everything will be okay. Its that one value in life we can cherish forever.",20,25,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12529,21061,8," It was my thirteenth birthday. I woke up on a sunny day which was odd for @ORGANIZATION because it was late @DATE. I got up with excitement. I ran to the kitchen where my parents were. My dad asked me if I wanted to go to work with him and i said yes. My dad is a roofer so i couldn't go on top of the houses because i was to young. I had to stay on the bottom and pick up trash that they would throw. I was doing that for a while, then i got my soccer ball out of my dads truck and i started running around kicking the ball. As i was running i noticed this slippery spot. I had in mind not to go there but i forgot and i stepped on the slippery spot. i fell but while i was falling some how i kicked the soccer ball and it hit the wall and it came back to hit me in the face. My dad and uncles were laughing their lungs out while i was turning red and embarrassed. They were telling me how funny it would be if it was slow motion.i was so embarrassed i put the ball back in my dads truck and i went back to work. The sun was coming down, and we were heading home. we arrived at my house and i walk towards the house door and i opened it and i hear ""@CAPS!"" @CAPS, i looked around and my friends and family were there. the reason my dad took me to work was because my mom was going to throw me a @CAPS party.i go and say hi to my family and friends. Then i went to go take a shower, iwas in the shower putting soap when all of a sudden the lights go out. I got scared and screamedas loud as i could. I ran out of the bathroom. Went to the the living room and the lights turn back on. My family and friends looked at me and started to laugh. In my head im thinking why are they laughing at me? I looked down and im naked.

Laughing is a healthy drug it affects you and other people for the best. There are many times in my life where all I needed was to laugh. All I wanted was to have someone there to make me smile and bring up my spirits. I have an example. I just moved again it was my @NUM high school. I felt totally alone I knew nobody, and nobody was there to help me feel less alone. I wanted a friendly face to smile at me, or talk to me. The whole @NUM hours at this new school was dreadful. When waiting for my mom to come get me I was hating my new life here. ""@CAPS @CAPS one talked to me on the first day, then @CAPS one will talk to me at all"" is what kept passing through my mind. I remembered everyday after school walking home with my group of friends, we would all tease each other, or just say something stupid. We were always laughing and happy. As I was sitting there waiting for my mom, I heard my name being called by a familiar voice. As I looked up I found my friends @PERSON, @PERSON and @PERSON sticking their heads out my moms car window waving at me. Seeing how school just barely got out there were tons of teenagers still @NUM, @PERSON, @PERSON!!"" I exclaimed. My unhappy thoughts disappeared and I was smiling. I could feel people starring at me as my friends got out of the car to give me a hug. For some reason I didn't care all I cared about was being able to smile again, and be truly happy with my closest friends. I grabbed my purse and ran over to them to give them all hugs. They missed two classes to come pick me up from school. My mom told them how unhappy I was, and that what I needed was a friendly face. She couldn't have been more right. After hugs, smiles, and laughs were exchanged my friend @PERSON said his classic line.""@CAPS @CAPS @PERSON?"" @CAPS one could help but laugh even my mom broke a smile. When getting in the car I forgot all about my bad day and how horrible I felt. I forgot about how badly I wanted my friends there to make me feel me. When they actually came I couldn't have been more happier. My life felt great, school after that was great. I made great friends there because my three buddies reminded me who I was, and pushed me to be me. They made me laugh and when I smiled at my new high school people were more open and welcoming to me. It wasn't long after that I @PERSON was able to go to school with a smile and laugh everyday. Friends have a great influence in your life they remind you to smile and how great a laugh is. Laughing is the truth between happiness I would have to say.

12531,21064,8,"@PERSON of laughter     Once upon a time there once lived a girl named @PERSON. The year was two thousand and fourty eight and there were only a few people that were alive after @DATE, thats @CAPS the world ended. @PERSON's friend @PERSON was a huge @CAPS freak. She would, by herself, make funny vidoes and put them on @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS. One day she was so bored that she went and sat in front of her computer camera and made an I'm a @ORGANIZATION"" video. It was the funniest thing @PERSON had ever seen. She was wearing a a @ORGANIZATION hat that was part of the @CAPS uniform, and was wearing a @CAPS shirt with some of the known characters. @PERSON was singing, ""I'm a @ORGANIZATION. I'm a little @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION. I'm slitherin' slitherin' in the garden, snatching me up a mouse, a mousey mouse. I'm going to move my tongue to taste you."" @CAPS she was finished she posted it on the web site. @PERSON showed all her friends what an epic faliure that video was, @PERSON of course loved it and so did @PERSON.      Once the video wasnt that cool or funny anymore, which that took about two point five days, no one really watched it and no one really laughed about it, which it was made for that purpose. But @CAPS someone would watch it for the first time they would go to school, laugh their butts off and feel like an idiot because everybody had already watched it, and they didnt think it was funny anymore. So from then on people called this kid all sorts of names, but the one that really stuck was @ORGANIZATION. Eeveryone in @LOCATION and @ORGANIZATION's friend group all laughed and @CAPS @PERSON and @PERSON didnt laugh, their friends would call them losers because they weren't laughing at the kid who was getting teased. Laughing @CAPS someone is being teased isn't funny. The reason why people laugh and put down others is because they are insecure about themselves and it's not a laughing matter.       @CAPS people watch the video of @PERSON saying she was a @ORGANIZATION, that was made to make people laugh and to think was funny, @CAPS didn't make the rude words people say to be used to put others down.      Laughing is a key thing to a conversation but also it's healthy for people to laugh. @CAPS others see that people are getting made fun of, it's not a time to laugh at them, it @MONTH be funny in some case but, put yourself in that persons shoes, feel what they are feeling @CAPS people say rude and hurtful things, people could stop the people who are throwing out put downs and stand for the ones who are getting their feelings hurt. Laughing was made for things that are actually funny. Say you walk down the street, on a sidewalk, and you walk by these punk kids who think they are the bown diggity, and they are poking sticks and throwing bottles and trash on at a homeless man with his dog, while the man is on the ground in pain from thses kids kicking him to where he cant move, are you just going to walk by and laugh because you think it's funny? No @CAPS not, @CAPS going to walk, or run, over to the poor man and see if he is oaky, then you maight call the police and see if they can find the kids who did this to this poor old man. See laughing at people who are down because of words or getting beat up isn't right and peeple need to stop, this is a world that if you are the last few people on the planet, and they have known about you laughing at others pain, do you really think that they are going to help you, or just walk by and laugh like you have? People are cruel in this world and we all need someone that is going to help us if we are hurt or down because of hurtful words.      One way you benefit from laughter, you feel good and you have people that will help you in the time of need, if you laugh about the right things. Tell @CAPS friends that if they laugh at peoples pain and anger, that one of these days no one is going to be there to stand up for them. You could be the change we have in schools, in work envirnment, in life in genral, be the change for @CAPS kids and grandkids, for @CAPS future friends, for the future world.""",20,18,0.0,38,0.0,0.0,0.0,38.0
12532,21065,8," When we look back on the past, everything seems to have had a deeper meaning. When we grow older, however, we see the world with new eyes. We see the truth, harsh, stripped of the glossy film that hid it. Laughter helps us see the joy once again, to remember it is there. When is the last time you got lost in laughter? Studies have shown that laughter releases feel-good chemicals in the body. It can add years to a life because, believe it or not, our bodies like to be happy. Laughter is a highly addictive and contagious drug and the best part is that it is free, legal and healthy! Laughter makes us feel better in times of need and brings us closer together. Through whatever is happening in our lives, laughter is one of the only things that can distract us from the pain and stress. As life gets more and more complicated as we grow older, we find that laughter is harder to come by, but no less needed. I remember a time when I was excited every day to go to school. I loved to arrive at the familiar classroom and see everyone who made my days brighter. We would tell jokes and reminisce of fond memories and in the process would make brand new ones for the future. Life was simpler, the worst of our worries surrounded the desperation to be older, to shed our youth and step out of the powerless shells we were imprisoned in. Of only we knew what that really meant. Smiles were not hard to come by and we all enjoyed the simplicity that our lives had to offer. Through all the memories and laughter, I began to realize that love existed aside from movies and family, the love that you find for a friend that you treasure. Laughter was the key variable, revealed in understanding my relationships. When you learn how to fall deeply in love as a kid, that patience and trust can get you through ever day of the rest of your life. All we need to do is to is remember not to forget. The simplicity of childhood is what makes it so precious. Unfortunately as we all grown older, the future looms over our heads, casting a shadow over the things we cherish. There is a predetermined way we are supposed to live our lives that for some reason, erases the plausibility of our true aspirations. Laughter gives way to sighs and tears while dimples are forgotten and replaced with furrowed brows. Everything in adulthood orbits around the office and is held to a nine to five obligation. Businessmen walk past looking like identical mindless penguins. Where did all the fun go? It seems that the pleasure is evaporated with every passing day. We no longer get to know our colleagues around a circle of carpet squares. Instead we are confined to our felt paddock and swivel chair. All the stress makes us forget to laugh, but we simply can't forget. Laughter is the amnesia that makes the cubicle into a fort and the chair into a rocket ship that will take us from our fort to follow our dreams.  So when is the last time you got lost in laughter? Make it now. Take the pen and turn it into a quill. Step out of your cubicle and find the world that you enjoy. Laugh every day because life is too short to forget.",25,22,0.0,47,0.0,0.0,0.0,47.0
12533,21067,8," It all started with a book @DATE @DATE ago. My mom had noticed I was struggling to find friends, so she took it upon herself to help me make some. She had a few friends from school who had kids of their own, some my age. I had been around these girls a few times as a child, but not recently. I'm not sure today what my mom saw in @LOCATION that made her think we would click, but she was right. What seemed like such a small action would change my life drastically. In @DATE, in my new house I first met @PERSON. That evening before she arrived I couldn't help but be very upset at my mom for doing this. I felt I was fine and fully capable of making friends myself. She acted like she knew me, but the few acquaintances I had she didn't believe would be good for me. I didn't think she could be right this time and I didn't want to waste my time. An abrupt knock on the door interrupted my train of thought, I could her muffled voices and footsteps downstairs. Quickly I retreated to my room and onto my bed. The bulky front door opened and closed again followed by footsteps coming up to my room. When @PERSON first walked into my room my first thought there was no way we would get along. She was a gorgeous blond girl, obviously popular and very confident. I couldn't stop thinking how she was going to call me freak and poke at my differences like the other girls at school did. ""@CAPS, what are you reading?"" @PERSON asked as she sat on my bed. Come look for yourself."" I replied offering her the book in my hands. I knew she would hate this book. It was about all the microorganisms that live and feed off your body. I was right and as she leaned over cautiously @PERSON read the book with a disgusted look on her face. Laughter was boiling up inside me, I couldn't hold it much longer. My small, dull room buzzed with my laughter. @PERSON looked over at me with another strange look on her face and began to laugh along with me. Once the laughter had stopped and the ice was broken we began to talk about other interests. @DATE short hours flew by and we were finding plenty of things we had in common. We shared funny stories, introduced new music to one another, and talked about hobbies. I couldn't remember the last time I felt so in-tune with someone, especially someone I had just met! Suddenly our conversation was interrupted by a brisk knock on the door downstairs, we looked at each other and smiled. In that smile I saw a real person smiling at me with real pleasure showing through. Very much unlike previous encounters with kids at school. Downstairs we said our good-bye's to one another. As the new, cool @DATE air began to rush through the opened door I reached out to hug her. To my surprise she took my gesture and ran back to hug me. Her hair smelled of hair products and powder, a smell very unfamiliar but surprisingly comforting. Once she was gone for the night I began to think. I really liked @PERSON and I wanted to see her again soon. I felt accomplished in some way and fulfilled to have this bright future opportunity brought to me so easily and perfectly. Guilt also struck me as I realized how I had felt about @PERSON at first. For someone who had been judged through most of school I had been very hypocritical. That night I stayed up later than usual thinking about the next time I could see her, how she had looked and tried to understand how we could get along so well. Despite these questions haunting the edge of my every thought I slept happily, thinking of the next time I would get to see her. All of those @DATE questions and concerns have been answered in the @DATE, and we are the closest friends. Not long after we started hanging out more often, we began to like one another a lot. One of my favorite parts about our relationship is how people get so confused to see us two different so close to one another. We can take the stares, comments and anything else we struggle with today and find a way to laugh together to reduce the importance of it. I have thanked my mom over these @DATE for many things, but mostly for what she has done for my relationship. If it hadn't of been for her my life would probably of been much darker. No one on that cold night expected this one meeting to evolve into our beautiful relationship. Laughter is an extremely vital part of a relationship whether it is being built or being kept up. Thanks to laughter excelling conversation @DATE @DATE ago, I have had the best experience I could of ever asked for.",20,21,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0
12534,21068,8,"  Sence I was a little girl I' ve lived without my bio mom, @CAPS gave me up for adaption when @CAPS was only @NUM, @CAPS wasn't ready @CAPS be a mom. @CAPS has always been a risk taker an never thought about her concequences. My adoptive parents have always been truthful @CAPS me about her an why @CAPS gave me up. I accept how my life has turned out an im very grateful, @CAPS i wasn't adopted i wouldnt have gotton @CAPS know my @PERSON, The most loving, adventurous, funny, wise women you would ever meet. As soon as i could walk @PERSON would have me out camping and hiking @CAPS her. @CAPS @CAPS was a nice sunny day no one would have any doubt were we would be. @CAPS we were at @PERSON's house in the @DATE or @DATE we would always be out in her garden boy how @PERSON @CAPS her gardens and flowers. No wait thats a lie @PERSON @CAPS nature period.  @CAPS has taught me how @CAPS appreciate everything around me exspecially nature, @CAPS me an her we are closer then anything you could think of, @CAPS shes the sky im her stars, @CAPS i' m a bird @CAPS's my wings. @CAPS's that simply. @CAPS hasn't always been easy for her an me, but the way we know how @CAPS cope is @CAPS laugh at everything an everyone, not in a bully or make fun of kind a way, but a good way. Laughin for me an my @PERSON comes like a second nature @CAPS us, @CAPS's what keeps us going an know that everything will be okay. A few months ago my favorite cousin @CAPS had passed away, @PERSON and I had barley seen each other in a while or had talked, but then everything happend so fast @CAPS @PERSON. That when we saw each other @CAPS was at his funeral. My sizemore family was all there, even tho @PERSON was gone he had a presence that was still there. That night after the funeral everyone went @CAPS my aunties house an just spent time together. Finally @PERSON and I got the chance @CAPS talk yes we were both teary eyed but we were laughing @CAPS.We were laughin at all the funny times we had @CAPS @PERSON an all the crazy things he did. One time he had went @CAPS go get my uncle from the airport an he was waiting there in his elvis costum holding a sizemore sign..Boy was @PERSON a goof.  @PERSON was just telling me all these things, and @CAPS was then that i relized @PERSON had tought me something else @CAPS appreciate. @PERSON had taught me how @CAPS appreciate laughter at a time @CAPS sorrow. @CAPS rejoice in a time of dealth, @CAPS have hope when you felt like you had none left. I learned that even tho people might not think so, laughter is the key medicine @CAPS everyones pain. People don't think of laughter as a cure they think of @CAPS as something you do after you hear a joke. Laughter is so much more then people give @CAPS credit for. My @PERSON taught me all those things, plus the real meaning of laughter, and that will always be @CAPS me.",20,18,36.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12535,21069,8,"Laughing is one of the things we do best. @PERSON and I talk almost everyday and never get tired of laughing. We talk about everything and even if it is the saddest thing in the world we will be able to make it funny in a way, it's just one of those things we do. As best friends it's our job to make each other feel better, and if one calls the other crying it's their job to make the them laugh and if it is funny for both @CAPS know it was a job well done. In @DATE, my uncle died, I called her crying my eyes out, she said, everything was going to be okay and to just think of all the good memories I had of him. One of the only ones I could think of was the funniest story of my life and even though I was still crying, through those tears there was laughter and I knew my uncle would want me to laugh and he was right there laughing with me.  @PERSON and I met @DATE, at @ORGANIZATION, where we spent a week out of our @DATE to get to know new people and getting closer to @CAPS. That week was one of the funniest weeks out of my whole @DATE, though me and @PERSON didn't ""click"" at @ORGANIZATION that week, we later found out we were more alike then we thought. Some people say when two people are to much alike the friendship doesn't work. Well, this is true yet false. When @CAPS are alike @CAPS can talk to each other about everything, yet when @CAPS hit those differences, and the other disagrees it starts a fight, but fights just bring people closer together.  Even though me and @PERSON don't see each other much, doesn't mean we can't be best friends. What if your best friend lived in a different state, does that mean they aren't your best friend anymore? No, it just means @CAPS don't see them as much as @CAPS would like to. Even though we live close to each other we don't always have time to see one another, but, when we do finally get to see each other there isn't a dull moment. About a month after @PERSON had gotten in a bad car accident, we went to skate world, @PERSON was on crutches so she couldn't skate, but that didn't stop her from having fun and making the @TIME full of laughter. She was up dancing to the music, on top of seats yelling, ""@CAPS wont ever see these people again in your life, why not just have a little fun? "". By the @DATE @TIME she got almost everyone in our group dancing up on the stools and I don't regret one thing that happened that @TIME, it was the most I had laughed in about a year. We were dancing and screaming for about three hours, before one the parents got their and after that we all went home. That is a @TIME I will never forget. A girl that was recovering from a horrible car accident made the best out of what she had!  When things don't work out the way we wanted, we just go on with life wishing that it had happen differently, but when we look back a couple years down the road we will see that it was just fine, and it @MONTH just make @CAPS laugh. somethings are hard to laugh about, but a good thing to do when @CAPS get to that point is think of something happy, or funny and try to laugh. Laughing has always made me feel better, and knowing that I can make someone with a difficult life laugh until they are about to pee makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I have done something good with my life that I was willing to help @PERSON with her struggles. To me that makes this life, a life worth living. Though @CAPS cant help everyone through every single one of their struggles, just being there sometimes helps them more then @CAPS @MONTH know.  @PERSON and I have planed out many lives we would like to live and looking back now on them all I can do is laugh, because in my heart I know they will never happen. Even if we try our best to make them happen I doubt they will. But, it was worth the laughter and a good time to make them up, and Believe they were going to happen for awhile and I know looking back in a few years we will both laugh. Laughing is a good way to get rid of fear, anger, and stress. It makes @CAPS think of all the good times @CAPS have had in your life, and lets @CAPS know that @CAPS had fun in your life. Though we fight, in the @DATE, I don't think anyone will be able to tear @PERSON and I apart, with all the laughter that is done. We are true friends.",19,24,42.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0
12536,21070,8," Laughter. Something everyone does. Its natural, organic, normal. They say children laugh more than adults, maybe that's @CAPS keeps them children. They can still let that deep instinct to enjoy themselves be expressed in bursts of happy noise. Laughter is always unique to every person. Some have musical laughs, others have deep belly laughs. Then there @CAPS those or snort or snicker, the kind of laugh that makes @CAPS laugh because @CAPS hear it. Those @CAPS my favorite. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" and I couldn't agree more. Laughing with people has been the greatest influence in my relationships with my friends. I have five girlfriends that I would not be able to live without. They support me, love me, and get me to be bold and get out of my comfort zone. There have been many sleepovers where at two in the morning all @CAPS here is the laughter of all of us at some shocking @TIME confession or horror at the ""would @CAPS rather?"" someone just came up with. One @TIME in particular was especially funny. It was last @DATE and we were sleeping on @ORGANIZATION's porch. It was a spectacular @TIME, the stars were out the air was cool but comfortable and a meteor shower was happening later on that evening. @PERSON started the conversation with her favorite catch phrase, ""@CAPS guys, hows life?"" We all @CAPS because if @CAPS @CAPS around @PERSON for more than and hour @CAPS will here this saying a @CAPS times.  ""@CAPS as five minutes ago,"" I replied.  ""@CAPS guys my life has completely changed,"" said @PERSON sarcastically. ""@CAPS really?"" @LOCATION asked, her little body curled up in her sleeping bag, ""@CAPS have @CAPS had a personality flip, @CAPS @CAPS'@CAPS now blond and stupid?""  ""@CAPS."" @PERSON said sarcastically, rolling her eyes, a very @ORGANIZATION gesture. We @CAPS at the ridiculous mental picture of ""the brain""being stupid.  ""@CAPS guys want to play would @CAPS rather?"" @ORGANIZATION piped in. I had thought she was asleep by now. All I could see was her red hair covering her face. ""@CAPS!"" yelled @PERSON, ""I can't handle my mind being filled with horrible mental pictures!"" she buried her face in her pillow trying to block the images. ""@CAPS @CAPS sure? I have some new ones."" @PERSON said with her best evil voice, ""@CAPS would @CAPS rather have to..."" ""@CAPS!"" we all yelled together and the laughter ensued.  ""@CAPS or @CAPS?"" @PERSON suggested. An unintelligible noise came from @ORGANIZATION's pillow. ""@CAPS did @CAPS say?"" I asked. She raised her sleepy eyed face. ""I'@CAPS too lazy, and unless the @CAPS is to be the first one asleep then I'@CAPS not playing!"" she dropped her head back onto her pillow.  ""I agree,"" @LOCATION added, ""I'@CAPS too lazy.""  ""@LOCATION it would take @CAPS four hours just to get out off this porch cause @CAPS'@CAPS so @CAPS."" @CAPS @PERSON. ""@PERSON I'@CAPS not @CAPS. I'@CAPS @CAPS!""  ""@CAPS just accept it @LOCATION, @CAPS'@CAPS @CAPS!"" ""@CAPS @PERSON I'@CAPS @CAPS!""We continued @CAPS this, bantering back and forth till slowly people began to fall asleep, drifting off in the cool @TIME air. I was the last awake, and as I watched the meteor shower I had a sudden epiphany. My life was pretty awesome right now.  It was @DATE, @CAPS school, @CAPS stress. I was laying on a porch watching a meteor shower listening the @TIME sounds and feeling perfectly safe, and I had the best five friends I could ever wish for. We joked and @CAPS with each other, but this is the first step to being so comfortable with people that @CAPS can tell them everything. Laughing with someone breaks the ice, it brings us closer together. Laying there I suddenly realized that because of all of our joking I felt comfortable enough with these girls to tell them just about everything, and I wanted to. I had never felt @CAPS this before. That I could do anything because there were five people that had my back through anything. I smiled to myself and as I closed my eyes I imagined all of the laughter I would get to enjoy with these friends.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12537,21071,8," One day, a day before the party for my brother's @DATE to be exact. We were setting up party stuff and cleaning the house and the apartment because that's were the boy's will be hanging out and sleeping. My cousin @PERSON and I were helping mom and the boy's that were already here and their names would be @PERSON , @CAPS and @CAPS. @PERSON was already here of course because he's the @DATE boy. The boy's were suppose to be cleaning the apartment but their boy's and the only things on theirs minds are girls and video games. They played video games instead of cleaning and mom got mad. Lucky for them mom was in a very good mood or they would have got @CAPS. The last to boy's showed up now.   The last two boy's showed up and their names are @PERSON and @PERSON and @PERSON is showing up tomorrow after noon. @PERSON was so exited that he was turning @NUM years old , he said "" I'm @NUM years old now no one can tell me what to do"" and I laughed and said ""@PERSON go make me a sandwich"" and he said ""@CAPS"" and I said ""so much for no one can tell me what to do"" and everyone laughed at him. He gave me my sandwich and all the boy's went to the apartment to clean @CAPS but when I got in there they set up @PERSON's x-box @NUM and was playing @CAPS. I told them to get cleaning but they decided not to listen so I got mom and they sure listened to her. She took @CAPS and put @CAPS on the kitchen table. They were not happy. They finally cleaned the apartment and got the x-bow back. @TIME all of us were watching movies and playing broad games then mom told @PERSON and I to clean my room , maybe a hour after that she walked by and said "" bed time"" and boy's go to the apartment. The next mourning.  The next mourning @PERSON and I woke up to the sun hitting us in the eyes and I said ""what a great way to start off the day"" and @PERSON said ""I know"". The best part of today is that we get to hang out with the boy's. When @PERSON and I got into the living room everybody was in the kitchen and partly in the living room. @TIME that @TIME the boy's thought @CAPS would be fun if they played cops and rubbers. The apartment was the jail. @PERSON , @CAPS , @PERSON were the cops and @PERSON and @CAPS were the rubbers. @PERSON and I wanted to play so we went outside and ran into @PERSON on the otter side of the apartment , he was the only one who knew we were outside. When I was running to hide behind the trees I felling in the hole that turns off the water for the apartment and my leg looked like cottage cheese and @CAPS was gushing blood and you could see my bone. I had to stop playing for the @TIME. Mom told @PERSON and I to go to bed.  The next mourning mom woke us up and asked if we want eggs and bacon and we said ""yes"". I crawled out of bed because I needed to go to the bathroom so @PERSON helped me up the stairs and when we were coming down the stairs @PERSON saw me hurting and being the amazing boyfriend he is he picked me up and carried me to the couch in the living room and sat me down on the couch and kissed the top of my head and said ""good mourning beautiful"" and I said ""good mourning to you to baby"". Now everybody is standing around for their food to be done. The boy's are making pizza if you wanted to know. Then my little sister @CAPS walked in to the kitchen and said ""ma'am I want a cookie"" and mom said "" okay , here you go baby"". @CAPS ran off with a very big smile on her face. The boy's got their pizza now and they just went back to the apartment. @PERSON and I looked at mom and said ""wow"" mom's like i know. We all laughed and started talking about boy's and friends , family , animals. @CAPS was a very fun weekend and even though I got hurt we still made the best of @CAPS. Even though I got hurt and cant do anything for the next two months or so , we still had a blast with each other and @PERSON said "" @CAPS was his most favorite @DATE he's ever had so far . @CAPS wanted her friend to come over but she had fun with mom and @PERSON , the boy's when they came in the house and I. Sometimes you got to work with what you got and @CAPS might turn out more fun than your normal plan you made. Just make sure your happy with the people around you. ",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0

So instead of writing about one experience where laughter is a key element I am going to write a montage of true events where laughter shows my true colors as to who I am. I think I should start with my blond moments first seems how that's my natural hair color. When I was little I would take my shirt off, throw it on the ground and be like ""mommy, I can't find my shirt"" @CAPS would tell me, ""@PERSON @CAPS just threw it on the ground"", I would look in all the wrong places and result to crying on the floor. @CAPS would pick my shirt off the floor hand it to me and then I would do the same thing all over again. Yeah @CAPS could say I was a little embarrassed when I got older and they had it on video camera, but that's what I love @CAPS grow up and laugh about what was once embarrassing and @CAPS move on.  There was another time when we figured out my initials spell @CAPS, so whenever I go swimming with my brother and our friends, they start singing the @CAPS theme song and I start laughing because if I let them think I don't care they will eventually @CAPS. Guess what, they still haven't stopped and I am beginning to think I @MONTH be stuck with the nickname @CAPS for the rest of my life. The @CAPS @CAPS kept rolling when I was in first grade my brother, who @CAPS the way was in second grade, decided to tell my first grade teacher I had @CAPS, @CAPS called my parents, who began to laugh like crazy and told her yeah, @CAPS does its a little thing called @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS. Looking back its funny because I remember the look on @PERSON's face; @CAPS could say it was classic.  As I advanced in my @CAPS years moving into @CAPS @CAPS, I joined an organization; the @CAPS @CAPS of the @CAPS for @CAPS, where I learned later on that the color black is prohibited at any and all @CAPS functions. Well, the night I was initiated I wore all black from my hair accessories to my shoes. I felt no embarrassment just the need to laugh. I found later that I like to make jokes or funny comments whenever I get nervous during a speech, so when I had to get up and give a speech in front of approximately one-hundred and twenty people I made little efforts at making jokes and comments, did I mention I wasn't very @CAPS at jokes, but the ceremony went on and people went along and laughed with me, even though I hit my head against a dream catcher.  @CAPS has taught me its okay to cry at the depressing things in life, its okay to fear the things that frighten @CAPS, its okay to love anyone @CAPS want, its okay to live your life, but most importantly its okay to laugh at your mistakes. I think that is one thing I will always remember and pass on to my children when I settle down with a family, which won't be for awhile I learned that lesson when I was babysitting my little cousins, who were sick, its a lot of responsibility, its a @CAPS thing my brother helped because I would of been nearly lost without him.  I know that because of the people who surround me with their positive attitudes and hearts gold that they have formed me to become a better person, to laugh when there seems no way out, to not only learn from your mistakes, but to laugh at them as well, to show that @CAPS have a deeper meaning for the way your life was meant to be lived. Remember that when life hands @CAPS lemons take the opportunity to make some sweet lemonade and then throw it on yourself so @CAPS and your friends can get a @CAPS laugh every once in a while.

12539,21073,8,"                Twins For a @CAPS  Laughter is a large part of who I am. I am a very happy, outgoing person, and I love to laugh. I especially the laughs that make your stomach feel like its going to fall out of your body and continue laughing on the floor. That's @CAPS I surround myself with people that are like me, that's my best friend @PERSON and I are like two peas in a pod. People tell us all the time that we look like twins, and when we're together @CAPS's like a hurricane of loud, crazy laughter. The best part of our friendship is that we are alike I think, and we use @CAPS to our advantage. One @CAPS @PERSON and I were taking a stroll downtown. We were just window shopping,when we past a clothing store that had on display a auburn tank top that had blue swirls coming up from the bottom and up one side, also a pair of dark blue jeans with a rip in the knee. @PERSON and I fell in love with the outfit, and as we stood outside the window like ravenous dogs drooling over a piece of freshly cut meat, an idea hit me.When I turned to @PERSON and said "" @PERSON? (her nickname) @CAPS if I was you and you were me when we @CAPS meet @CAPS later?"". She turned to look at me, and her eyes lit up like @CAPS was @CAPS. We ran into the store and bought the outfit. We looked in the mirror and we both knew we could pull this betrayal off. The pants fit our curves, that were identical, like a glove, and the tank top rested on our bodies in the same pattern. The only difference was she was a bit taller than me and my hair was longer than hers, but we deiced that showing a little neck wouldn't be to bad, @CAPS we just threw our hair up in buns and called @CAPS good. As we left the store, we got asked if we were sisters, and we replied in a simultaneous ""@CAPS, kinda"" @CAPS was reassurance that if we could trick them, then we could trick anyone.  We comfortably walked towards the county library lawn where we were meeting @CAPS. when we were close to the lawn of the library @PERSON turned to me and said ""hide behind this tree, tell I head back, and then sneak around back and freak him out!""@CAPS I hid behind the tree while she went up to say hello, he asked where I was and she said ""I do not know actually""while she dug in her bag, ""but I think I dropped something down there, I'll be right back, stay put."" ""@CAPS"" he replied. All the while I was sneaking around the back of the garden and I hopped down off of an embankment and said ""@CAPS I am!"" he was gawking off at a car that was parked a little ways down the road, he jumped a little, and I said ""@CAPS did I scare you?"" in an little school girl voice, and he replied ""@CAPS, of course not! A man does not get scared."" I just rolled my eyes and him and said ""I have something for you, but you have to close your eyes"". He was apprehensive at first but he did as I @NUM had managed to sneak up behind him, and when she tapped him on the shoulder he turned, but he gave me a look of bafflement as he did. When they were face to face @PERSON shouted ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS!"" and @CAPS nearly jumped to the moon. @PERSON and I were laughing @CAPS hard we nearly peed our brand new pants. @CAPS in confusion whipped his head between @PERSON and I, and said ""@CAPS this is interesting"" we continued laughing like buffoons, and @CAPS even giggled a little. He told us ""@CAPS't you two ever do this again!"" and I said ""@CAPS! We basically are sisters @CAPS @CAPS not play the part?"" he just glared at me in discontent and @PERSON rolled her eyes and said ""@CAPS? Did the man get scared?"". We both cracked up again and @CAPS just smiled cause he knew we were playing around. @CAPS was just a blast after that, @PERSON and I continued to torment the town as twins. We ran around cars and into stores and had a stupendous time being absolute fools. We even got @CAPS to laugh hard enough to clutch his stomach. When @CAPS was time to @CAPS, we ventured to the parking lot where @PERSON's mother was going to pick us up, she did a triple take when she saw us, she just laughed at us when we got in and asked ""@CAPS are you two wearing the same @NUM and I just looked at each other and busted out laughing, and we replied ""@CAPS's a long story"". @CAPS was the perfect end to an amazing @CAPS being my best friend.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12540,21074,8," Somewhere along the road a guy once said ""a laugh a day keeps the doctor away."" @CAPS the hell was he talking about? I didn't really know or understand the importance of it either. Until i found out first hand how important those words could be, and how right that unknown genius was. It was just a few years ago when the most traumatic event happened to me.Do you remember that first girl or guy you thought you loved? If you can, do u recall that feeling of heartbreak and utter distraught? Well, if u can then u might understand how I felt...and sometimes do feel. If not you @MONTH learn something of importance to which you might realize why you're single. Before that certain event,when @CAPS and I would end up fighting, we'd end up making jokes about it to get through. We'd sometimes intentionally go to see romantic movies to laugh at how the girl or guy in them would break down crying. In one of those sobbing weeping, just obnoxious sounding cries. The kind that pisses you off more than making you feel sympathetic. Back to the later and key point of all of this, when the horrible situation occurred @CAPS and i were together for years, two and a half to be specific. yeah, long time I know. The day it ended it happened to be in the middle of math class (can you believe that? the middle of freaking class!) @CAPS convinced me to go sit back in the corner of the room with her. It'd be just us, no interruptions. We did this everyday so it wasn't anything to unusual to me. I was thinking ""yeah! i get to work alone with my amazing girlfriend!"" I was such a idiot. I do fondly remember glancing her over before sitting down. @CAPS was wearing white bleached jeans and a black band t-shirt. @CAPS had skin so white and unblemished a porcelain doll would be jealous. To top it all off dirty blond hair, rose petal lips and believe me on this one unending curves. I was dressed similar. I was in my @PERSON t-shirt, black jeans and my signature burgundy beanie. I had natural tan glowing skin and dark brown curly hair that covered my dark green eyes. When I sat down I'm not exactly sure @CAPS it was, but I felt like something bad was going to happen. Almost like a oncoming thunder storm or that paranoid feeling of being watched. The most dreadful words fell out of her mouth like water coming out of a faucet. ""We have to break up"" my heart seized in my chest her other words blurred into one becoming inaudible. I remained not moving and completely silent like a stone gargoyle. I couldn't help, but laugh at myself silently inside my head. I didn't ever say anything back. I didn't trust my voice enough to be steady and unwavering. Even if my words didn't...my body did. I couldn't control the shaking of my body as if it was having one big muscle spasm. I quietly and quickly walked out of the room making sure to have my bag in hand. I didn't want a reason to have to come back. The hallways along with the tiles and eventually grass along with the pouring rain all blurred into one. I just kept on walking and walking, with no wear in mind. Until when i was finally to tired to stop. My cheeks were tear streaked to my jawline and my eyes were red and bloodshot. The most wonderful thing in the world to me in my life had ended. As i look back at @CAPS and I's relationship, laughter was how we survived and got through a lot. It was however not enough. No amount of trying to laugh it off would help, like those petty arguments we had. I will sometimes though look back on how I reacted and that by itself will make me laugh. I was no better than those people in those movies. Unlike them however, I did not weep and bawl obnoxiously.",20,17,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12541,21075,8," Side by side with my best friend @PERSON we begin to walk to the park. The rained on @DATE @TIME wasn't very pretty or warm but the pleasures of watching lost and the hopeless at this particular park in @LOCATION was enough for us. Approaching the grass to the benches, mud was dominating my shoes when I was starting to think other wise of such fun. Sitting on the damp leaf filled benches we notice a man and his child walking toward us. Although this man was quite odd looking we quickly grew excited for what he had to say to us was more than likely going to match his appearance.  The fellow looked to be in his late thirty's with tight pants covered in what appeared as sharpie written all over him. A knitted scarf and with a small hat to match he had this flaming homely look about him. Beside him, a stroller with two small children, one at hand while the other lounging in a storage pocket below. The father we later find out, pretends his @NUM year old daughter is whispering in his ear, shouting things like ""@CAPS WAS THAT""?! suggesting he hadn't heard her although we knew she hadn't said anything at all. ""@CAPS want me to ask the girls if they want any raisins, is that what @CAPS want""? odd enough we look the raisins bushing them between the cracks of the benches on the few times he looked away. @PERSON an I then look at each other when he starts ranting how beautiful and striking her eyes were. The laughter was watering out of our eyes and being under such pressure to redeem, it was wanting to burst out of us both. The man then take out his phone with a video of a country singer compare their faces toward one another.  Minutes into the video I look away since the phone was now in @LOCATION's hands. I feel her nudging me from leaving her even just with my eyes and hadn't continued suffering with the ridiculous video. Looking up I see the father staring at her as if waiting for some kind of reaction. Back to @PERSON I notice how uncomfortable we all were including his kids and he hadn't even a clue. throughout this whole interaction I hadn't said more than @NUM words in between the silent laughter and looking always that I couldn't control. My persistent friend who also hates being impolite then hands over the phone with a smile on her face and cheeks of red. ""@CAPS really look just like her @CAPS know""? All these questions he had for us and no answers but laughter prancing inside us. The boiling silence was rising between us and very little we could handle next. Pulling out a script the man then asks to see our acting skills and would like to direct us sometime. Once he spilled those beans on us we jolted directly toward her house while pouring out our enormous amount of laughs being held in and effecting our ability to talk. breathe by breath running I could finally speak causing me to blurt how i could hardly fathom the reality of his request.

12542,21076,8," Have you ever got a detention from laughing an inordinate amount in class? If you haven't, you're very lucky. I know that teachers absolutely hate students that don't pay attention in class, or students that will randomly start laughing when they're giving a lecture. I'm that student that will randomly bust up laughing (preferably at my own jokes) in class. In other words, I'm a teachers worst nightmare.  Ring....ring....ring, time for @CAPS. It was a beautiful afternoon and I was feeling great! When I walked into the class, I automatically noticed that our teacher wasn't his blessedly self. But I ignored it and went on with what I normally do, which is get out my @CAPS and crank up the tunes. I like to listen to music because it relaxes me and helps me focus more. The downside to listening to music is that you can't exactly hear everything that great. When I listen to music I have those moments when I feel like I'm in a movie that everything seems like it's in slow motion but you can't hear anything. It's almost like I'm secluded in my own little world and no one can see me or hear me, until I start laughing that is. Finally class started and everyone was being abnormally loud, at this point I was starting to see the steam come out of our teachers ears. He looked like a cartoon character off of bugs bunny. The teacher was getting very indignant and impatient with the class. I didn't exactly pay much attention to him so I went back to listening to my music. After a while, our teacher was now starting to get frenzied with the class even more so he told everyone whoever talks again will get their name written up on the board and you will receive detention.  About five minutes later my friend @PERSON comes and walks by me and starts talking to me. When I listen to music, I have a tendency to talk loud because I feel like they can't even hear me. So I start yelling, and she starts to giggle because when I wasn't looking my teacher was just staring at me wondering why I was talking so loud. He turns around and writes my name on the board (that meant I was given a warning). I turn to look at the teacher, oh no here it comes, @NUM my laughter is out, I couldn't control myself. When I laugh uncontrollably, I laugh like there's no tomorrow. ""@CAPS! You owe me thirty minutes of detention!"" said my teacher. One of the biggest problems that I have is I'm very easily amused, I laugh at mainly everything and anything. When my teacher yelled at me, his facial expression was just way too funny, so I began to laugh even harder.  When I start laughing, my friend @PERSON usually can't help herself but start laughing with me. She tells the teacher that she was the one that made me laugh so she thought she deserved detention too. So she got what she wanted, detention! One week later, @PERSON and I arrived in good old detention with all the other ""rebels"" (that's what I call myself now) it makes me feel tough. The thing that we have learned is that we should never be sitting next to each other. When we sit by each other, we can't stop laughing, but we decided to sit by each other anyways. What do you know, we almost got more detention while in detention, imagine that.  ""@CAPS's to short to live with tension and regrets, so just laugh it off!"" That motto is what I try to live by everyday. I feel like laughing is a very important part in my @CAPS, it really helps me forget what is bothering me. Even though I @MONTH get in trouble from laughing, I don't regret it one bit. Some people are very serious and they don't know how to let things go so they're always tense. Laughing releases tension and for me I feel like it brings me closer to my friends. I love laughing with my friends and the feeling of your abs hurting from laughing is awesome!Live your live, laugh as much as you can, and love those that mean the most to you.",19,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12543,21077,8,"How Laughter @CAPS Laughter can be a huge help when going through difficult times. Like the time when my brother got ran over by a skid steer(tracked loader) at our farm. We didn't know how bad it was going to be @CAPS through our time of uncertainty our family was there to be with us and help us through and keep us from getting down. It was just another day on the farm and we were out running the machines. The day was going just fine until after dinner my mom had told me and my brother to go out and cut corn. ""@CAPS mom"" me and my brother said in unison. She wouldn't hear it and told us to hurry up and leave. So we went down to the shop and got the skid steer out. My brother, @PERSON still hadn't come down and so I started it and started driving towards the garden. I saw my brother coming from the corner of my eye. He was running as fast as he could and I yelled at him to stop and wait @CAPS he kept coming. He tried to jump on the front forks @CAPS missed and fell. I got out of the cab and saw him lying on the ground crying. My uncle was standing near by when it happened and he called the ambulance. We didn't know what was wrong with him @CAPS his leg looked a little funny so we looked closer and saw the bone sticking out of his leg. Finally when the ambulance came they looked him over and asked me some questions about what had happened. I told them all that i could and went back to the house. It was nerve racking to not know what was going to happen to his leg @CAPS we just hoped that it wouldn't be very serious. I spent the night at my grandparents house. I had a lot of trouble falling a sleep that night though. The next morning was @DATE so I had to go to school. I still didn't know a lot @CAPS i did know my brother's leg broke in a compound fracture. The whole school day my friends were helping me feel better by telling jokes and funny stuff and just keeping my mind off the accident. It was hard not knowing what was going on with him. Later that night we went to see him. We learned that he had just broken the big bone in his leg and that it had gone back together just fine. My mom stayed with him the whole time he was in the hospital so things around the house was a little bit different. Me, my dad, and sisters had to clean and take care of the house. It was a pain because I hate doing house work and having to do it all the time was vary boring. When my mom and brother finally got back after about a week things went somewhat back to normal.  My brother had to ware a thing on his leg that sucked the fluids out of the wound to help it heal faster. There was giant screws coming out of his leg that attached to a bar on the outside of his leg. He has healed up just fine though and has a giant scar where the bone came through his leg. It was very nice to have family and friends there to cheer us up and help us get through. And that is why laughter @CAPS. ",20,18,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12544,21078,8," We all understand the benefits of laughter. Laughter can show emotions, but can also go to the distance of strengthening a friendship, or relationship. To many people laughter is a very important part of any relationship.  First, Laughter is very important in a friendship. If you cant have a fun happy friendship then you wont have a good friendship. Building up to a friendship is always sometimes difficult. It can take up to a good laugh, to not laughing at all to determine your friendship. Having a friendship with someone is one of the best feelings. Knowing that you have someone you can trust, talk to, be there for you, and the most important laugh with is a great feeling.  Also, laughter is important in every childhood memories. Thinking back to when i was little i was always laughing. Even though my mom and dad left me and my brothers i always had my grandparents, brothers, cousins, even aunt and uncles to keep my busy and always have a good time. I think laughter is an important thing being a child because its healthy, you can learn to keep others spirits high and keep others laughing and happy, . and its always good to have a strong, fun, happy relationship with your family.  Last, laughter is very important in a relationship. I think it will build character to your relationship and shows everyone that your happy with the person that your with. Laughter will also build a good and strong healthy relationship and will lead to good things. If you think about it laughter is probably the most important in a relationship because when you decide to marry the person your with it will lead to not getting a divorce and fighting and you will have a strong relationship.  So, therefore after pointing out that laughter is important no matter what age, what gender, friendship, childhood, or relationship you should see that my point is that laughter is important no matter the situation. It helps build a strong person and also builds character to yourself.",15,20,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12545,21079,8," Have you ever been in an an awkward situation and lightened the mood with laughter? I have, as have many. I find that laughter makes people more comfortable, which allows them to be their own person. Laughter @MONTH even help some to attract a positive, friendly crowd, who enjoy funny, happy people. Laughter @MONTH not work in this way for everyone, but here are some ways it has helped me. I was at a homeschoolers' group in @LOCATION years ago and didn't know anyone there. After walking around a while this girl talked to me. She was funny, and being able to laugh made me more comfortable and I had a fun time. I just had to fin d the right person. Another time where laughter might've helped was when I was invited to a birthday party of a friend I hadn't seen in over two years. Several others were there I hadn't seen in a long while. The whole visit was awkward and all I wanted to do was blend in. I acted like everyone else, but if I'd had laughed and been more comfortable I would've been my own person. When I first came to public school I was nervous to meet new people, and what kind of people there would be. After a week or so people got to see my personality, the funny, happy, laughable person inside, and that clicked with a lot of people. That's why I'm friends with the people I'm friends with now, because our alike personalities matched. Laughter brought me to a good place in life. Laughter can make a lot of people happy and comfortable in awkward situations. It can encourage people to show their own personality and attract people like themselves. I think the world would be a happier place if everyone could laugh.",19,15,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0

I didn't stop and she yet again yelled at me to stop singing. For a third time I annoyed my sister and she responded with a punch on my arm. For some reason I started to laugh. It didn't hurt and I thought it was funny that she hit me for just singing a silly song.I had a really strange laugh so my little sister started to laugh because I was laughing, then my older sister quite harshly screamed at me and my younger sister to be quite. My older sister yet again punched me trying to get me to stop laughing. By now I was laughing so hard I could hardly breath and my face was turning into a shade of purple. It really was funny when my mom couldn't hold it back any longer and started cracking up and laughing with me and my younger sister.

12547,21083,8," The members of my immediate family are known to be both incredibly clumsy and easily startled. Broken dishes are a common occurrence in our house; as are spilled drinks, stubbed toes, and blood-chilling screams whenever the toaster pops up. Though all of us are used to these types of things, not everyone around us is, which can lead to interesting encounters. Many people find pleasure in jabbing me in the sides to hear me scream, and laugh when I trip over the slightest crack in the floor. Though it can get annoying sometimes, it @MONTH also give me a reason to get over my pride and laugh at myself, thus relieving any tensions I @MONTH have been feeling about the social setting. For example, a few years ago I was staying with my @CAPS @CAPS troop at @LOCATION. Any situation involving large groups of people can be intimidating, but it is increasingly terrifying when the group is made up of girls, ages four to eighteen, with only a few adults thrown in to make sure the girls do not bludgeon each other to death. Worse still was that where I was staying, which was a hybrid somewhere between a cabin and a tent, the majority of the girls were in middle school and, needless to say, we did not always get along. Despite the fact that we were not all the best of friends, though, there were times when we were able to get past the petty differences, such as who was cool and who was not, and enjoy the time we had to talk and joke around with people who were in similar places in life. On one such occasion, I was attempting to make my bed on one of the top bunks, and was in the process of stretching my sheet over the petrified mattress which @MONTH have possibly been around in @NUM @CAPS.C. Being the intelligent person that I am, I decided to lean against the wall behind me for balance, forgetting, of course, that there was in fact no wall, but only a thin, cloth-like material which could not support my weight. The second I realized what I had done, I reached about frantically for something to hold on to and tried in vain to keep myself from plummeting backwards to the floor and my certain death. Milliseconds before I would smash into the hard wood floor, I managed to grab a hold of one of the bars on the side of the bed and hung on for dear life, swinging back and forth and back and forth. Finally, I let go and propelled myself, almost gracefully, onto the bed sitting underneath mine. It was a very long time before the laughter died down. In that short amount of time, cliques and biases and grudges were all forgotten as we became not just a bunch of random girls placed in a room together, but a group with our own strengths and weaknesses; passions and flaws. Though the adolescent years are incredibly difficult and there are many times when it feels like you are the loneliest person in the world, it is always comforting to know that there are other people who laugh and cry just like you and experience many of the same joys and embarrassments as you do. One of the most essential skills to learn is that you have to be able to laugh at yourself from time to time and let yourself be vulnerable in front of other people. We @MONTH not all be the same, but we all have the same basic desires for love, acceptance, and laughter.",20,21,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0

We laughed so hard, we started to cry. We had just finished going clothes shopping at the @ORGANIZATION and mom said that I could pick where we went out to eat. My brother started whining about it but mom said it was fair because he got to choose last time. I chose @CAPS @CAPS which is what my brother said he would have picked anyway. I picked that restaurant for two reasons, first because it was close to the @ORGANIZATION, and second because I love seafood. Mom didn't have a lot of money so she said we should all share a few things instead for everybody getting their own. We bought two pounds @CAPS @CAPS legs, and order of popcorn shrimp, and coconut battered shrimp (mainly for herself). I'm kind of glad we all shared because it was cheaper and it was just the right amount of food so we didn't have to take home boxes. We never eat leftovers anyway.

People were starting to stare at us but we still couldn't contain ourselves. Pretty soon our eyes started to water and then there were tears.

Mom managed to pay the tab just fine, but as soon as she got in the car and herd me and my brother laughing, she started busting up again! She was absolutely convinced it was the cake. she said there is no other reasonable explanation that we would laugh and laugh about nothing. Now I believe that statement because we've tried every other dessert and none of them had the same effect on us. We go back whenever we know we can afford dessert and want to have a nice long laugh.

There would be nothing to look forward to if laughing didn't exist. Laughter creates memories, relationships, and it fills in the awkward silence between two people.   Some people don't realize how important laughing is. Life without laughter is like life without water. I think that's how important laughter really is. The quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is true, but laughing is more then just an element. It's way more important than that. Well I guess we could all live without laughter, but who would want to?  No laughter means no fun times like: swimming, water parks, ice skating, dancing, etc. Those fun things can lead to laughing. Without anything fun to do no one would look forward to tomorrow. Everyday would be a waste, if there wasn't any laughter in the world.   Some people might just think that laughing is just an element. Why is that? Laughter is important enough to be more than that. For example water is an element because it has something to do with the earth. It stands for the ocean. Laughter doesn't fit in that category. Laughing has such a huge impact on our lives. Laughing makes everything tens time better. Laughing creates memories, memories creates relationship. That's why laughter is an important part in any relationship. It's amazing how the smallest thing can make such a big difference in our lives.",15,19,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12554,21092,8,"The @CAPS of Laughter.  Laughing is a huge part of most everyday life. It is a very common emotion that I see hundreds of times a day. Whether it be from something as simple as a funny face, a joke, a picture, and even little things people do or say can bring laughter to even the most serious of people. @CAPS friends and I laugh constantly. We can make something funny out of pretty much anything. I think being able to laugh, and joke around are very good traits to have as a person because it makes life so much more fun and optimistic.  I can't even count the number of times I have been in a complete laughing fit because of @CAPS friend @LOCATION. She is by far one of the funniest people I have ever met in @CAPS entire life. Though she is extremely funny, she is not exactly the brightest crayon in the box. She asks questions after people already tell her the answer, she says exactly what I say after I say it without even noticing that I had already said it before her, and sometimes she even trips on the concrete while racing someone to her car after practice. The things she does @MONTH not be super intelligent sometimes, but they sure can give anyone a good laugh.  I remember not even a week ago I was in the car with @LOCATION on the way to volleyball practice, and she just belted out the wrong words to the song we were listening to. What made it even more funny was the fact that even though she knew the words were wrong she kept singing like she knew every word. At the end of the song we laughed so hard we cried. By the time we got to practice her and I had been laughing for about ten minuets straight. During practice our @CAPS had been explaining directions to one of the drills. She told us loud and clear to serve the ball to spots one and five @CAPS. @LOCATION not fully understanding the directions, decided she should ask and make sure it was all clear to her. So she put her hand up and asked, ""@CAPS, so do we @CAPS serve to spots one and five?"" @CAPS whole team broke out into hysterical laughter. @LOCATION who didn't understand stood there looking confused, but when she finally understood why we were all laughing she joined in. That happened about three more times throughout our two and a half hour practice. She even got put in front row which made us all laugh because she is very short and looked really funny next to the six foot one girls standing right next to her. By the time practice was over I think we had gotten a better workout from laughing then from playing volleyball. On our way out to the car, @LOCATION decided she wanted to race a girl on our team to her car. @CAPS agreed and they took off in a dead sprint. You could see the determination to win in @LOCATION's face, and all of a sudden they were no where to be found. I ran up the stairs to see who had won, @CAPS to find @LOCATION face down on the ground with @CAPS sitting next to her laughing hysterically. I felt bad, but it was so funny I couldn't help but to laugh. We sat there laughing for a good fifteen minutes, and we laughed about it all the way home. That was the icing on the cake to one of the funniest days I have ever had. I will never forget that day and all the times we laughed together. I think @LOCATION and I being able to laugh so much together brings us closer as friends because even if we get irritated with each other, or something bad happens, we can always find a way to laugh about it in the end, and that is something every good friendship should have. Laughter can't always make everything better, but it can bring @CAPS so someones day, and you never know the positive effect a little laugh can have on even the grumpiest of people.

12555,21093,8," Many people think that @ORGANIZATION is just like any other. These people are very wrong. @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION is very different than most. For you see, it is filled with humorous people. These people make up a lot of the bright side of @ORGANIZATION. Where these people are you might ask? Why, they are every where. The best place to look is in the hallways, especially @DATE @ORGANIZATION, during lunch, @CAPS after @ORGANIZATION. Most of the people I will tell you about are friends of mine. There are also a lot of people I don't even know the names of. There is even a teacher I'll mention something about. Well enough chit chat, lets get to it shall we? I will first start with the teacher. I forget her name but she likes to talk with a @CAPS accent. She is also very enthusiastic, @CAPS I do mean enthusiastic. She often says, ""@CAPS we go!"". It's very funny. I have never seen her without enthusiasm. Many of the students are really disturbed by it. It can be annoying at times but at least she's not all gloomy or other. In fact we might even need more like her at this @ORGANIZATION @CAPS many others. There is also a student who is also very enthusiastic, not all the time but quite often is he. His name is @CAPS. @CAPS is quite a jolly kid. He loves to sing. I do mean he loves to sing. Even if he doesn't know the words to the song he is singing, he will sing. People always joke about him around him. The jokes are usually mean jokes, but he puts up with them @CAPS laughs along. I really do have to give him that much credit. It would be hard for just about anyone to put up with such rude words, let alone laugh with them. But enough of that. He is very jolly @CAPS really makes you laugh, which is really great. Don't stop being funny @CAPS. There is a funny pair of boys who can knock your shoes @CAPS, perhaps even literally with what they do. These two boys, named @PERSON @CAPS @PERSON, are very humorous, as well as dangerously humorous. Ever heard of a @CAPS? It is a brand of a toy that is very fun for little kids, as well as big kids. This toy is shaped like a bowl. You turn it inside out, aim the rim at the ground, @CAPS drop it. When it hits the ground, it pops up into the air. Well, @PERSON @CAPS @PERSON love playing with the @CAPS, so much to the point that they found a new way to play with it. Instead of hitting the ground with it, they hit each other with it! They love to hurt each other. Eventually, though, the @CAPS got very worn out @CAPS tore. It needed to retire from its rough job, but @PERSON @CAPS @PERSON wouldn't let it. They just couldn't stop playing with it. @PERSON, @CAPS, @CAPS I haven't seen them playing with it lately. We think it might have broke. Ha ha! Never go wondering throught the hallways with @PERSON, even if you have a destination. Trust me on this, you don't want to! @PERSON gets destracted very easily in the hallways. If she sees someone that she's wants to talk to, she doesn't tell you. She just twirls around @CAPS rushes over to them. For this, always have her take the lead if you do go with her; at least you'd know when she wonders @CAPS the trail. Never the less, @PERSON is still very humorous. She makes lots of random sounds. You get completely @CAPS guard @CAPS just can't help to laugh at how weird sounding those sounds are. @CAPS on the other hand, not only does sounds but also does hilarious facial expressions. She always tries to mimic the funny things her goats @CAPS pets do when she tells us about them. Together, @CAPS @CAPS I are very funny. In the @DATE finals started, we were drawing such goofy pictures of each other @CAPS random things. I drew her as a stick figure going to the moon, but the moon was very far away. We cracked up! She once redrew a little comic her brother thought of more than a year or two again. In the comic, it was a very ugly man who was telling his friends that they were going to a night club, but the ugly man turned out to be a woman. During finals, there was also a guy pulling is friend through the hallways by the arm. The friend said that it was very comfy. Then, they told a teacher about it! Ha ha ha! So you see, @LOCATION is much more than an ordinary @ORGANIZATION. You could probably call it a clown @ORGANIZATION if you wanted to. Ha ha ha ha! You would never truly know just how many ha ha's I say a day until you visit, so come on over. We will let you join the fun!",20,20,42.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0
12556,21094,8," Everybody knows that long car rides can be both physically, and mentally exhausting. Picture a family of four : a mother, a father, and two daughters in @CAPS. The father is behind the wheel, the mother is in the passenger seat, the older sister is on the left side of the back seat, and the younger sister on the right side. The sun is rising, and you're still on the road. The father is tired, after driving all night. The mother just woke up, yawning, and is wondering how much further until the destination. The sisters are looking out of their windows with extremely bored expressions. Even with cups of coffee, and loud music the atmosphere is still lifeless, extremely dull. What could possibly bring up this lifeless atmosphere? My guess, a form of entertainment. As a young child, I was always on the road. Moving from place to place, because of my father's work. At the time, we were living in a state known for it's snow. @ORGANIZATION. Wonderful wildlife, breathtaking views, and beautiful landscapes, untouched by man. During the long winter months, the snow covered the ground, like a blanket on a bed. You could wake up in the morning with two new feet of snow. Although, despite living in a cold, isolated state, the summers were extremely hot. A total twist to someone unfamiliar with @ORGANIZATION's weather. This was around a decade ago, so the enviroment might've changed, but nevertheless, it is still a breathtaking, beautiful state. After coming home from school on a cool @DATE day, my mother told me to start packing my room. I knew we were due to leave that @DATE, but I was still hesitant on leaving my friends. Every time that we moved, I had to say a heart breaking goodbye to the friends I knew for the few years I lived there. I went to my room and started to pack for a long, long trip. My father came to me and told me we are moving by car. He asked my sister and I to go with him so he could pick up the uHaul. We went to check out the sizes, and the condition it was in. As usual, the trucks weren't in the best of condition for moving over a long distance, but it's better than nothing. My father drove it back home, with my sister and I, and my father started to put the packed boxes in the truck. My mother, my sister and I finished packing the rest of the boxes. The boxes with valuable, and mandatory items were stuffed in my mom's @CAPS, along with our cats in their cages. After getting everything packed, and loaded, the hired uHaul employees drove the uHaul away to our new destination, @LOCATION. Everyone had mixed emotions about leaving. My mother loved her neighbours, my father had some amazing coworkers, my sister and I made some spectaular friends, but we had to say our goodbyes to our friends. It's not the first time, and it's not the last time, but every time it still hurts. The times we spent together, will always being in our memories! Off we go! To our new temporary home. Driving from @LOCATION to @LOCATION. The only thing that I didn't like, was that we had to be in @LOCATION in less than a week. A week to drive that long way? Less stops, more driving, and no fun, or sight seeing... a total drag!! It was really chatty and energetic in the beginning, but everyone soon got sick of being on the road. My sister's body didn't handle it well in the beginning, and neither did mine. Half way to @LOCATION, all conversations stopped. The atmosphere started to fade, and so did the excitement. There was absolutely nothing to do in such a small area. I wanted to try to make the rest of the drive fun, so I started to sing in my tone deaf way. Since I was so young, my voice cracked midway through the song we were listening to, which caused in uproar of laughter! My mother started to say that I was simply adorable, and my father started to mock me. My sister started to sing, too, and before you knew it, everyone was singing along! Spirits were high, and everyone was having fun singing, and laughing. We started being more active after that, too! The rest of the trip down south was full of energy, and both time and distance passed quickly. It's always fun to spend time with family, but it'll be even better if you spend the time in a fun, exciting way! Make things fun, keep a positive, enjoyable outlook on everything!",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12557,21095,8," Laughter can not only be a benefit to ourselves but to others as well. We only seem to use it whenever you feel the need to become happy, but in reality it shouldn't be the only reason why. Laughter is not only being able to feel better but to let out what you need to let out. Being able to enjoy yourself is pride and you should feel better about yourself. Whenever you laugh, how do you feel? Do you feel like the world is lifted off of your shoulders and you feel better about yourself? I don't mean you have to laugh so loud and so much that you fall off your chair and roll around but a simple chuckle would do the trick. Watch your favorite movie or go have fun with friends, as long as you are laughing you will and should feel better about yourself. That brings us to what happens around @CAPS family.  When I was younger I would go on trips with @CAPS family up to @LOCATION. At the time I lived in @LOCATION. Every @DATE we would cram anywhere from five to nine people in a van and be on our way. Having hardly any space of your own you would think it wouldn't be any fun. All in all we would have some fights about where to stop on the way from food or when to turn but nothing too serious. Being younger then everybody I was wildly bored. So to fix the problem I would make @CAPS family tell jokes, make funny faces, do something. Right when somebody would let out a joke or made a face, I would crack up laughing. Pure bliss and pure innocent. It didn't mean that they were funny or that they were even trying but to let up the intense shoulders, I would laugh. When we would get to where we were staying on @CAPS great grandparents land, we would cram yet another time, in a small area for our sleeping. Everybody would get a cot and would have to endure the warm daylight and the harsh cold bitter @TIME. The cold nights were the ones that got to all of us the most, because @CAPS great grandparents had land meant that the place we were to stay at wasn't filtering heat. Sleeping bag and the clothes on your back were the only thing that we were able to get. So when the sun slipped slowly from shinning its bright light among us, we'd bundle up. Knowing me I did not listen to what @CAPS family sad and I would drink tons of water before I rest @CAPS head against the cot.  If you have common sense, which when I was younger did not. You would know that if you drink a lot before you go to bed and having the cold surround your body, you would have to use the restroom at some point during the @TIME. Because @CAPS aunt was only @NUM years older then me, should would be the one that would have to wake up to walk me outside, down the driveway, to the porter potty, wait for me, then go back to sleep while trying to shake off the shivers that controlled her like the puppet master. Knowing @TIME, she was not happy with @TIME situations, I'm sure nobody would be. The last time she took me, she made sure it was the last time she would get up to take me to the restroom.  The @TIME came that she had to take me. We started walking down the driveway. The wind was not like other nights, ripping every which way and piercing through @CAPS skin. Another odd thing about @TIME was instead of the dull tired face @CAPS aunt usually would have, she was awake, more the awake, she seemed to have a slight grin on her face. Since it was pitch dark she had the flash light with her. She opened the door to let me in and shinned the light down in the cracks so I would be able to see more clearly. Once I was done, I felt the shaking of the porter potty and heard in the voice of a monster the ""@CAPS y was coming to get me, run, run run!"" @CAPS blood rushed all over, warmth is what I remember feeling. Pushing the door open, screaming, running for @CAPS ""safety"" is what went through @CAPS mind. As I realized @CAPS aunt wasn't with me, I looked back. Only to find her laughing uncontrollably at what just happened. The meaning behind @TIME would be that you can just turn a bad situation into a good one if you rearrange the problem. You can turn it into a laughing matter instead of a dreaded time. @CAPS aunt making me do something she would think was funny would be a better sense for her and relieve her from whatever she thought she felt. Its a cause and effect placement. Causing me to panic effected her to be at more of an ease.",19,16,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12558,21096,8," Have you ever felt really good after you laughed a lot? Well studies have shown that after you laugh you not only feel better, but it's a great way to lose calories. One time when I felt bad my cousin came over and made me laugh. It was a very important part of our relationship, she to only made the day better but put more energy in it. When people don't laugh how can you have as much fun?  Studies have shown laughing does a lot for your health. It increases a certain blood flow in your brain which helps a person to be more energetic and happy. It has also shown that laughing leads to a longer life span. Also every time a person laughs it helps a person burn calories. If it's healthy for you why not laugh a lot? Just think, if nobody laughed how would this world be? It would be dull and full of unhappy people, just like this one time when my cousin came over to see me.  One day I was feeling down and depressed. Nothing was going my way and it was ending up a very bad day. Then all of a sudden my cousin came to @ORGANIZATION and surprised me. I was in @ORGANIZATION one day after school and looking at some things when she came in @ORGANIZATION and snuck up in back of me and scared me. We both started laughing so hard. She made a bad day turn into a fun one. We had a movie night and ate candy and pickles all night. We made songs up and sang them. We had the best time of our lives. All night long we had this party. I don't know what would happen to everybody if none of us ever laughed.  If we didn't laugh then our relationship certainly wouldn't be as strong. It would seem like we were sad or depressed all the time. If their was no laughing I wouldn't look forward to seeing her as much if we just sat around and didn't laugh. Laughing for me is a huge part of having fun in any relationship. It shows your comfortable with the person and are having fun also. If you have ever been down and wanted to give up, you know that's not fun at all. But whether you watch a funny movie or talk to your friend and it makes you laugh, you know what joy it puts in your life. So laughing must be an important part of you life or in any relationship you have.  Overall laughing for me is one of the most important things a person can do to make another person feel welcome and comfortable around you. Also a great way to have fun and lose calories at the same time. If you need some happiness in your life then watch a funny movie or hang out with people that make you laugh.",20,17,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12559,21097,8,"Social @CAPS @CAPS people think of laughter as a way of showing how you feel, almost like an emotion. I look at laughter in a different way. Laughter is a form of communication. Sure you @MONTH laugh when something is funny, but the truth is that you can control it. So @CAPS do people laugh? They laugh to convey a message; basically they are letting you know that what you said or did was amusing to them. Overtime, laughter can build relationships, or even start them, all because when someone laughs at you or with you, you are sharing a common ground. I know that laughter is an important thing in my life because, without it, I would have never met my best friend. When I began sixth grade, I was scared. I was scared that I would lose all of my old friends and become one of those kids who sits alone in the cafeteria every day wishing that he had someone to eat his greasy pizza with. Of course I was overreacting, but the thought was always lingering in my mind all through the first few days. Soon I even began to notice that my friends were actually find new people to hang out with, and I was beginning to feel as though I was becoming that outcast I had feared to be. Then I met him. He was a skater kid with dark hair down past his eyes and white, almost pale, skin. I was with one of my few friends, @CAPS, when I saw him riding around near the front of the school. I didn't really think much of him besides the fact that he had some of the coolest shoes I had ever seen. I was actually surprised when @CAPS walked up and started to talk to him like he had known him forever. I walked with him to avoid the image of being any more of an outcast. As soon as we are standing in front of him, he says something like an insult that I would usually brush off as nothing, but this time for some reason made me really mad. I said things back and before I knew it, we were in verbal warfare. In the end I knew one thing: I hated that kid, and he hated me.  Towards the middle of the year, our school had a dance. It was the first dance I had ever been to and I had butterfly's in my stomach. I got a ride with one of my old friends, @DATE. I liked @DATE because he was never judgmental or anything like that, he was just friendly. When we were in the car driving to the middle school, he told me that he had to pick some else up, which didn't really bother me at all until we got to the house. The house wasn't very impressive it could have been a cardboard box for all I cared. When i saw the the kid's left foot step out of the house I knew exactly who's shoe it was. As he got in to the car, I pretended as if I hadn't seen him. I failed. The whole car ride was nothing but awkward. When we got to the dance I walked on the right side of @DATE to avoid confrontation. @DATE scenced the tension and stopped walking. What he said next surprised me a little. ""@CAPS don't you guys just get along?"" We both stood there, eyes locked, when skater kid made another one of his ""nice comments"". I thought it was going to be the beginning of the year all over again, but I did something I didn't expect to do: I laughed. He laughed too. It was almost as if for the first time ever, we were friends. The whole night we hung out and danced like crazy. We had become friends.  During the rest of the year, we became better and better friends. We went over to eachother's houses and hung out at school. That was when I realized that we were best friends. Even now, in ninth grade we are still best friends. It's crazy how one small giggle can escalate into that, but that's what happened. I don't know how laughter can do that, or @CAPS I even laughed that night, but one thing is certain: laughter is important. ",25,21,0.0,46,0.0,0.0,0.0,46.0
12560,21098,8," Entering into the classroom, I began to shiver from anxiety. I was the new student in the fourth grade, transferring from a public grade school to a @CAPS school kept my head swimming with questions, which I put aside as I stepped into the room with a large white ""@NUM"" on the exterior wall. I swear, I could feel my bones literally shaking because of my nerves. Surprisingly, no one approached me as I came in. I noticed that they were all surrounding this @CAPS-go-lucky brunette. No one really even took note that I was there until the teacher looked up. After introducing myself to her and the class, I looked back at that brunette who was previously surrounded by the group of my to-be peers. She smiled at me as I stood there, with my feet uncontrollably glued to the ground, looking blankly at her for a few seconds. When someone told me this girl was the other new student in their class, I understood why everyone was staring at her. I soon became green with envy over her because of all the attention she got. I was unintentionally a fairly jealous child, and when I noticed that everyone wanted to be her friend and I got somewhat ignored, I stomach slowly twisted in knots more and more each day as I began to form feelings of suspicion and dislike towards this girl. Even her name sounded suspicious to me. @PERSON. I had never in my life heard of anyone named @PERSON before. Luckily, I sat on the opposite side of the classroom as her. And even as a month passed, I still felt uncomfortable being near her, so I stubbornly avoided her. My birthday soon began to creep up after the first month at @LOCATION. I was beginning to find out which people I wanted to be friends with, and which people to avoid. Unfortunately, even the people I had gradually grown weary of, had to be invited to my birthday party because it was a class party and I didn't want anyone to be left out and since the class only had thirty people in it, I could only deduce that word about the party would spread around and people would begin to talk. I knew that I hadn't built up enough of a reputation for people to know who I really was or what my personality was actually like. As, I was putting an invitation in everyone's beige, square cubby, I hesitated when I came across ""#@NUM"". This was her number. The number of that girl with the bizarre name that I had an undeserved, grudge-like suspicion of. I cursed myself violently after I put that birthday party invitation into her cubby. When the day for the party finally rolled around, I had everything set up just how I imagined. I even had the perfect @CAPS @CAPS cake picked out for myself. The guests began to arrive knocking at the glass door, temporarily staining it little grimy knuckle prints. @PERSON came alone. As I opened the door, she timidly and immediately shoved a gift at me and shyly muttered under her breath ""@CAPS birthday @CAPS"". I welcomed her traditionally, as I did with everyone else and showed her to the backyard. The party continued to go in several directions until my mom gathered everyone around, so I could blow out the candles. @PERSON stepped up next to me. With a confused expression on my face, my mom leaned down to whisper that @PERSON had the same birthday as me and she would blow out the candles with me. I couldn't believe it. The person who I had selfishly pretended to not exist, was the person who I had to share my cake with. After blowing out the candles, everyone left because the party ended and I silently pouted for having to share my birthday with another person. After the party, I walked into the house, only to find @PERSON sitting on my steps. Her mom apparently couldn't pick her up for another hour. I came over to her and casually started making small talk with her. A few minutes later, my brother ran in with a huge glob of frosting in his hand. He yelled @CAPS birthday to me and threw it at my face. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. He ran downstairs to his room as I continued to stand there with my mouth gaping. Then, I heard someone laughing behind me. I turned around to see @PERSON giggling. And without warning I started laughing too. And neither one of us could stop. It was at that moment when I realized I was wrong about her. We spent the rest of the hour playing and laughing, and by the time her mom came, we were begging for a sleepover. Although we were unsuccessful, I had grown to understand that this girl was someone I wanted to get close to. @PERSON, through that first laugh, became my best friend and continues to be my best and closest friend today.",23,20,0.0,43,0.0,0.0,0.0,43.0
12561,21099,8," My best friend @PERSON and I have a tradition that we made up. Every time she comes over to my house we always slide down the stairs in a sleeping bag. We came up with @TIME @CAPS she was spending the @TIME at my house. While sitting on the staircase with nothing to do it suddenly hit me. I turned to @PERSON and said""@CAPS could two little girls possibly do to have fun in the middle of the @TIME, @CAPS all they have to work with is a long staircase that has been sitting right under their noses the whole time?"" and to @TIME she says ""I'm listening."" @CAPS we were both getting excited because we finally found something fun to do.I said ""I'll show you. We just need to get all the pillows we can find."" The two of us scampered around the house looking in every room and brought all the pillows we could find back to the staircase.""@CAPS @CAPS do we need all these pillows for?"" @PERSON asked and was surprised @CAPS i said ""for padding."" @CAPS the pillows were set up at the foot of the stairs, I told her of my brilliant plan. She loved it! We couldn't wait to get started. ""@CAPS purple sleeping bag will be perfect for @TIME"" said @PERSON.  I ran down the hallway to my room, snatched my sleeping bag, and sprinted back towards the staircase. My purple sleeping bag is super slick and was just the thing we needed to glide down the stairs.  @CAPS, @DATE, we are fourteen and fifteen @DATE old, we still have fun doing @TIME. Over the @DATE we have improved it, making it nerve racking and loads more fun. @PERSON and I have agreed on some safety precautions, which we thought were necessary. @CAPS we are just using the sleeping bag we don't need them, but as we have added on to that we have agreed to wear a helmet and sometimes add a few pillows. The helmet kind of scares my mom because it's even needed. One @TIME, while my parents were out, @PERSON and I had been eating way too much sugar and were extremely hyper. The two of us were sliding down the stairs but it was starting to get too easy,and wasn't as much fun as it was @CAPS we were about @DATE @DATE old. We wanted to make it even bigger and better than ever before! We started brainstorming. My brothers room was upstairs and we somehow wanted to incorporate his mattress into our fun. @PERSON and I dragged the mattress out onto the staircase. We both sat down on the mattress, pushed off, and went shooting down the stairs. We could barely keep a hold of the mattress. The farther we went down the staircase, the farther we slid off of the mattress. We were laughing @CAPS hard @CAPS we got to the bottom, we almost slammed into the wall! It was @CAPS much fun. After that first ride we decided we had better put an extra pillow up on the wall somehow. One thing we hadn't thought about before we went crashing down the stairs, was how heavy the mattress was. It was very hard to get back up the stairs, but we didn't mind because we were having @CAPS much fun.  @PERSON and I were getting tired @CAPS we decided to take a break. The two of us hauled the mattress up the stairs , it one last time before plopping down on the couch in the opposite room. Not too long ago my mom had bought an inflatable exercise bean. Shaped just like a real bean and had handles on both sides. @PERSON started messing around with it, and @CAPS she said ""@CAPS try it?""We both rushed back to the stairs, ready to have some more of the reckless fun that we love. Our imaginations were bouncing off the walls. @TIME time the two of us felt it was time to mix everything together for the ultimate ride. We kept the mattress on the top of the stairs and measured out just where we needed my sleeping bag to be. Our idea was to be sitting on the exercise bean, on top of the mattress, slide down off the mattress, land on the sleeping bag waiting on the stairs to give us a turbo boost, and finally be sent flying into the pillows at the bottom of the staircase. I found some duct tape @CAPS the @PERSON could tape the sleeping bag to the floor.  @PERSON let me go first. I was nervous because we'd never done @TIME before. After a minute a finally pushed off. It was a bigger drop from the mattress to the stairs than I thought it would be. @CAPS I landed on the sleeping bag it was like being inside of the @PERSON video game, and hitting the turbo boost. It was scary but @CAPS I got to the bottom the two of us were laughing uncontrollably. We had @CAPS much fun.   ",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

She lives up in the woods and has a bunch of quads and motorcycles. All me and my cusin did was ride,have airsoft gun wars, and build giant forts. We planned on only staying one night but ended up staying three.   So the first night we were there we built a fort out in the woods. The fort seemed really good at the time, but the next morning we had other ideas. So the next morning we were getting ready to go outside and work on the fort. He got done before me so he went down there first. By the time I got half way down there I heard him scream and come running out of the fort. He was yelling @CAPS .....MICCCCEEEEE! So i figued we must have a little @CAPS problem and laughed to myself. So I walked in there to see for myself and sure enough there was a bunch of little @CAPS running around in there. That was the end of forts on the ground for us.  The next day we decided to have airsoft wars(guns that shoot little plastic bb's). We were having alot of fun shooting eachother mainly because it hurt. Like I said we were having alot of fun until I decided to try and hid up in a little tree. He found me and shot me I fell out of the tree and broke my gun. That was the end of the wars plus I almost broke my leg. I guess that was payback for laughing about the mouse thing.  After the wars ending we decided to go ride quads for a while. There are alot of trails around her house to ride on. He road a dirtbike and I rode a quad, I road a quad so I could make new trails. We made some really good trails up there. It was really muddy up there and very wet. While we were way out in the woods on a long ride I ran out of gas. So I had to walk all the way back to the house for gas then walk all the was back up there.  The last day we were up there we got up early. We wanted to go out and look for a place to build a new fort. This time we were going to make a tree fort so we didnt have to worry about critters. We spent from the time we got up till the time we went home on this awsome tree for. My granndpa has alot of wood that he dosn't use because he really to old to build anything so we never ran out of wood.                          ",20,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

We loaded the trike and quads in the back of the truck and trailer and was off to the woods. We get out their and uloaded our rides, we get all of them warmed up but the one with a clutch. the only way to get that one started is to pull it with the automatic quadWilber says to @PERSON that he will get it started so u pull me. I get up their and hook the rope on to aech quad @PERSON says hes ready,so @PERSON is taking off fast and some how the hook just comes off and hits him prfectly on his back he gets up and it looks like hes dancing. He lifted up his shirt and asked s if there was any mark, oh man was there the hook hit him perfectly, it looked judt like a hook wa printd on his back.             @PERSON starts to taer up a liitle bit while holding his back. i didnt blame him i would of to, u could hear it snap when it hit him. I look over at @PERSON and hes trying not to laugh, @PERSON looks over at @PERSON and gets off the quad and started to chase him. I finally got there attention and said,""we came out here to ride not to kick some ass."" we finally get the bike going but @PERSON was to scared to pull the quad so i had to do it, as soon as we get the quad with the clutch to warm up, a cop car comes down by us then turns his lights on. We new what we were going to have to do so as soon as i see @PERSON take off i took off. @PERSON and I look back to see if @PERSON was behind us and no he was not.             @PERSON told me we should just leave him ,but i told him that would be way to mest up we come back and the cop told us he was suprized that we came back. we asked @PERSON what happend and he didnt know after dealing with the cops for the day, we tried to figure out what was rong with the bike and we found out some one was messing with the carbrator and they were totally off.             it sucked we dont get our licences tikll we eighteen ,but for @PERSON its twenty one, that really sucks for him.

It was nice, got to hang out with our neighbors, ride quads, feed the rabbits, horses and cows, put on make-up.    Sometimes my dad and i would be sitting on the porch and look at the scenery. The beautiful suset, the trees and their colors. A crowd of deer wandering around, picking on the groumd eating the scraps of food. The cows walking along the fence line waiting for dinner to go their way. While we were sitting there we would talk about random things or play jokes on eacother and just laugh and have a good time.  One evening when we were sitting on the porch my dad asked if i would like to take a walk. I said yes and so we went into the pasture, and somehow he had a camera. We walked and talked and he took pictures of everything. I wasn't looking but suddenly he was taking pictures of me. I looked at him and i saw that the camera was facing me and his finger was holding the button and wasn't letting go of it. I ran in circles and laughing so hard that i was crying and i couldn't stop.

12565,21105,8," Laughter @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS Laughter I believe can snatch me out of the awful crater which I hide away in. It creates a bubble of joy in the pit of @CAPS stomach, and it finally bursts joy throughout me. Laughter feels like a @DATE day hearing the bugs hum with the warm breeze, and knowng I am able to float up into the cotton candy clouds, then not realizing I'm laughing at everything I do. Laughter flips @CAPS gloomy days upside down, and makes me realize every reason I have to be happy. Sixth grade is a big mile stone in everyone's @CAPS. Getting lockers, having more freedom, being able to be around older kids, and so much more. I always had a dream of laughing with @CAPS old best friend and giving boys our numbers, except it all changed when she moved away. No one talked to me or hung out with me at school. @CAPS old best friend never left @CAPS side no matter what, so it was uncomfortable walking thruogh the crammed hallways of a huge school with just air breezing by me.  School became unpleasent to go to everyday for eight hours. Most sixth graders don't like school because of the homework and would rather social with other classmates, but not me. I felt alone when other sixth graders (mainly girls), made jokes about @CAPS appearence or how I always got good grades in school. They would steal the projects that I made and worked really hard on. They also took books, papers, and supplies like pencils and pens. I learned new formulas and facts, but never did I learn how to socialize with other peers. Three quarters went by of @CAPS sixth grade year and I felt alone like suddenly the rest of the world shriveled up and died, or moved far far away. At night, @CAPS eyes would spew gallons of salt water tears down @CAPS face splashing @CAPS pillows. @PERSON was @CAPS other best friend and never teased me or talk behind @CAPS back, but she stuck to the people who did. It overwhelmed me walking near the group of girls who would put other people down, but hid it with their cartain acts around specific people. They would tell other students rumors about innocent people and how gross and weird they were. I didn't want them telling people rude comments about me, so I ignored them the best I could by doing activities on @CAPS own. A girl from the other elementary school noticed @CAPS loneliness at school and decided to talk to me. I was shy and felt @CAPS stomach starting to do flips which was never a good sign. All I could do before I looked like a scared kitten was smile and nod. She told me that next lunch I should come hang out with her and her friends, but those girls were the girls who teased me. The next lunch I went with her feeling sweaty-hand nervous the entire time. Once I started talking to them about myself they just smiled and said I was adorable and a really awesome person, which made me smile from cheek to cheek. It felt good to smile for the first time in a long time. A couple of days later, the girls told other sixth graders I was a goody two-shoes that is so dreadfully boring. @CAPS smile faded quickly once I heard those rumors that spread through @CAPS class like a disease. @PERSON left the group of girls one day at lunch to talk to me about what had happened. I told her how I felt about what those girls did to me and how it felt like the world always would agree with whatever they said. She confessed to me that she truly didn't know why she was hanging out with them in the first place. I was relieved to hear her say those words and for her to not agree with what that group was saying about me.  The girls who talked bad about me behind @CAPS back were left to do whatever they desired, while @PERSON filled the breezy air by @CAPS side with laughter. Together we laughed at everything that amused us. Sometimes we would even laugh at each other during boring assemblies or at a ridiculous person attempting an act that everyone knows they cannot do. When she had a bump in the road in @CAPS I supported her and did what a true friend would and just laughed at how dumb the other person was being just to make her laugh at the situation. In other words laughter pulled me out of @CAPS awful pit I hid away in and made me find @CAPS true friends in @CAPS. Laughing has made me forget bad times and people, and has made me realize when they bring me down I have a million reasons to laugh until I have to gasp for a sip of air. Laughter has been a huge part of any relationship for me because I can have an enjoyable time.  ",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12566,21106,8,"Water @CAPS of @CAPS @CAPS we think that laughter is just an emotion, but in all actuality it's practically a way of life. We use laughter to cheer people up, or get out of trouble. People do stupid things just to make others laugh. I personally think laughter is a reason to live, and that every one needs more of it in their daily lives. I have always been the type to make every one laugh and feel better, and I would always put myself in pain just to cheer someone else up. When I was a child my friend would always be picked on at school, for no reason really. And I wasn't the type to take action, or try and get back at someone. But that all changed when my friend came home covered with food crying before school was even let out. She told me that these girls threw their lunches at her and were calling her names. So the next day I went to school with her in the morning and I took @CAPS filled with chocolate milk, smoothie, egg yolks and soured milk. When she pointed the girls out to me I grabbed the balloon with chocolate milk and threw it right at one of them and it hit her in the chest. She started screaming that her clothes were designer, like someone would actually care. I looked at my friends face, she was awe shock, but I could tell she was trying to hold back her joy because she knew I was not yet finished. I then threw one with egg yolks in it and got in a girls hair, her scream was earsplitting. The smoothie filled one got two of the girls who were hugging to try and keep each other safe (or trying to use each other as a shield) but it wouldn't work with my throws. They started to freak out and run to the others, which was a bad idea because they were all hudled together trying to figure out who it was. By the time they figured it out it was too late, I was already throwing the biggest balloon filled with soured milk at them and they couldn't get out of there fast enough. It landed in between all of them and exploded when they had turned to see what it was that was thrown. It covered all of them and they started screaming so loud that the school officials started coming out of the building to see what all the screaming was about.  I could see everyone of the kids who saw the whole show coming over to me, they started to tell me how amazing it was and how funny the girl's reactions were. Some kids were still on the ground laughing so hard they couldn't breathe. Some thanked me and told me that these girls had been picking on them for a while. I looked at my friend who was on the verge of tears. She ran over and hugged me so tightly I thought the air was going to be squeezed out of me. It's been ten years since then and I still talk to my friend, she even occasionally calls me if she's having trouble with someone at school. As for the girls? I haven't heard anything about them since they all got transferred to different schools. I guess laughter is the source of all joy in our lives, and helps people become closer then ever before. My friend still says that it was the best day of her life. Some of the other kids who witnessed the event go to high school with her now, and all ask how I am and want to see me do something like it again. Unfortunately I had to turn them down and tell them they have to learn how to deal with their own bullies themselves. I imagine that some of them have come up with very creative ways to get back at people by going off of what I did.",22,18,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12567,21107,8," Laughter is an essential component to any relationship, as it can erase any previous uneasy feelings and has a tendency to bring two people together. This phenomenon stays true whether the individuals involved are in the same room, talking over the telephone, or even communicating over the internet. My best friend and I share a special bond in which laughing has played a large role in keeping us together.  Laughter can keep people together even in times of hardship. My best friend, @LOCATION, is @CAPS, and we have shared many laughs over the @DATE years we have been friends. We first met while playing an online computer game and immediately enjoyed each others comments and comical statements. We would immediately burst into laughter when one of us would say something that could be considered even the slightest bit funny. He and I shared many laughs over the next two and a half years. Recently his family had financial troubles and was not able to pay the internet and phone bills for several months. Work during this time seemed to be more of a burden than usual, as I had few people I could truly relax and have a laugh. Only the occasional laugh with my friends who live locally could cause me to forget the disappointment I had from missing one of my greatest friends. @DATE weeks ago there seemed to be some hope that my best friend and I would be again able to communicate as before. While staying up @TIME one @TIME doing homework, I noticed that I had received a message from the long-lost @LOCATION. I immediately chuckled inside, thinking of the good times we had shared just a month earlier. To my disappointment, the message which I received was not to tell me that he had internet at his house once again, but to thank me for the @CAPS gift and to tell me he was at another friends house for the @TIME. He also mentioned that he would enjoy playing a game or two with me during this time. While this provided some comfort, it did not fully satisfy my hunger for laughter because his computer which he had taken with him was missing the drivers which allowed the use of a microphone. That afternoon, though somewhat disappointing, reminded me of the many great times we had shared together. One @DATE ago, my hopes were finally confirmed when @LOCATION messaged me to tell me that he had internet again. Though we had missed being together during the @DATE break, we were thrilled to once again be able to communicate. I am glad the @TIME he chose to get internet was a @DATE, because we played and laughed till @TIME. The laughter which we shared that @TIME washed the disappointment far from both our minds. My days are once again complete, as they are now an almost perfect balance of work and laughter. Laughter truly does bring people together, far more than I had previously realized. Though my best friend and I are thousands of miles apart, when we talk and laugh together, it seems as though he is in the same room with me. I hope that some day soon we @MONTH be able to actually be in the same room, sharing laughs and enjoying life. This example is just one of the many where laughter has greatly improved the outcome of a particular situation, making the individuals involved even closer together than they had been before.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12568,21109,8,"  Laughter is a important part of my life.The best way to pass the time is laughing with friends and family. Think back on all the fun times you've had, if you do you'll find that most of them you are laughing. That's because laughter and fun go hand in hand. Everyone likes to have fun, therefor everyone likes to laugh. Laughing is good for you in many ways, it keeps you happy, helps maintain healthy relationships with others, and it relieves stress.  Also a lot of people laugh when there nervous, I'm one of these people. Especially when you're put in a awkward situation. Like when you have to do a speech in front of the class. I remember my first speech in high school, it's one of the scariest things I've done. It was @CAPS year and I slouched down in my chair and tried to get as low as possible so the teacher couldn't see me. I wouldn't make any eye contact with her either. I put my back pack in front of me in order to block her view. Every time she'd look around the room to pick another person to go I'd hold my breath and hope it wasn't me. Every time it wasn't me I would breath out in relief.  Finally it was getting down to a few people and I knew my doom would soon await me. I decided to take a chance and peek over my back pack to see who the teacher was looking at for her next victim. What I saw when I looked at her was her eyes meet mine. I tried to hind behind my back pack again but it was to late. She had already started to call my name out.  What should I do? I thought to myself. Should I tell her I'm not ready? Should I try to get out of it? I wiped my sweaty palms on my blue jeans.Then I stood up and started to walk toward the front of the room. I could feel a nervous knot building up in my stomach. With note card in hand, I began to speak. My words were quiet and shaky. My speech was about uniforms in school and if I agreed with them or not. As I went on I could feel myself start to trip over my words. Then I started to laugh, which I always do when I'm nervous. I could hear other people in the room start to snicker. I smiled and looked down at my note card and continued my speech. After wards I felt a big relief to get it over with. It wasn't perfect but laughing at myself when I messed up helped me get through it without falling apart from my nervous.  Although not everyone reacts this way, laughing can help relieve tension in some situations.But always be careful not to laugh in situations were it's not appropriate. It's not good for you to have constant stress. Finding things to laugh about can be a good way to relieve stress. Laughing might not be the right behavior to get a A on your speech but it did help me keep it together to make it through. Laughter is important to everyone. It's a good way to have fun with others and it keeps you happy. Laughing is a good way to relieve stress. Your relationships will grow stronger if you find things in common to laugh about. If you learn to laugh you're sure to have a fun and happy life, I know I do. ",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12569,21110,8," Laughter is a part of life that doesn't need to be taught. We're all born with the ability to laugh. Laughter and being able to laugh has been with us since the beginning so we don't really think about how important laughing can be. It gives us a sense of relief, a feeling of joy, and it also brings people together despite barriers like background or language. I think one of the most important things laughter does for people is bring them together. When you meet with someone you haven't seen in a long time or you have to be in a group of people you don't know, a little laughter can break the ice and bring you closer. I want to tell of a time when I visited my family in @LOCATION who I hadn't seen since I was two years old.   My brother and I were the only ones visiting from our family. So we didn't get to have our mom there to make us feel comfortable, or introduce people. I was quite worried about being able to communicate with my family in @LOCATION because although I can understand and speak in @CAPS, I'm not fluent. Being able to bond with the part of my family I never knew was very important to me and I was afraid that language would prevent that. I was also concerned for my brother because he can't speak @CAPS very well at all. While on the plane I contemplated how I should introduce myself, topics to talk about, and prepare answers for certain questions. I didn't want the language barrier to cause an awkward atmosphere.   Finally it was time to arrive in @LOCATION. We landed in @ORGANIZATION, @LOCATION where a lot of my relatives live. My brother and I collected our baggage and went to go look for our uncles and aunts. We saw them waiting for us and @CAPS waved enthusiastically. Then naturally we responded with the same enthusiastic feeling. As we met them for the first time we exchanged hugs and phrases like ""I'm happy to meet you."" @CAPS were very kind to us and welcoming, but it still didn't feel like I was meeting my family. Things were very different and new for us. It was a lot to take in for two people experiencing jet lag.   The first night, we stayed at our oldest uncle and aunt's house. We had dinner together and talked about how our family is doing back in @LOCATION. It was pretty awkward. Communicating with elder relatives who can't speak @CAPS was a lot harder then I had thought. The first night passed as I slept in the uncomfortable humidity. The next morning our uncle and aunt had planned for us to have dinner with our cousins and other uncle and aunt. I was excited to meet more of my family so soon, but until then we had to pass the time exploring our new surroundings. My brother and I checked out the house and walked up and down the streets. Immediately we could see the differences from what we were used to. We had a lot of fun embracing the fact that we were in a different country we have been familiar with, but never really known.   At last it was time to meet up for dinner with our other relatives. We drove into the downtown area of @ORGANIZATION and met up in a restaurant that overlooked the ocean, as @ORGANIZATION is right on the coast. I related to my cousins more because @CAPS were younger, in @CAPS're mid twenty, and generally I can get along easier with young people. We gathered in the noisy restaurant and were seated in an area sectioned off for more privacy. As we were ordering our food and admiring the scenery from the window, I felt more at ease. Our food came and we started to eat. While we were eating, my cousin started cracking jokes which made everyone laugh. My brother and I were laughing so hard we teared up. During the whole dinner there was laughter and smiles. At that time I really began to feel like @CAPS were my family. I was really thankful for my cousin who started the laughter, because with out all the laughing I don't think we would have bonded so quickly.That was the time I felt that laughter is very important and brought me closer with the people I love.",23,22,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12570,21111,8," Everyone knows that when it comes to coach @PERSON sr. theres always going to be a bunch of laughs, giggles, jokes, and pranks. If you dont experience any of the above, then you are absolutely lame. It all started when my lovely sister @PERSON decided to make it to @CAPS in @LOCATION, @ORGANIZATION, of course she wasn't going to want to go alone. That is why she brought @PERSON, @PERSON, and me. We promised to eachother that we were going to make the best of memories. Nothing in the world is better than sharing emotions with those who care for eachother. We had arrived in @LOCATION, @LOCATION on a lovely morning, we were all a little tired, but for the most part we were all hungry for sure, that is why coach took us to @ORGANIZATION so that we could buy some snacks. He, of course, ran straight to the @CAPS.Pepper That old man always had to have one of those with him no matter what. Being a cross country coach and all, he wasn't a very good influence over his athletes. Anyway, if you are a @LOCATION fan you either know, or should know that he never liked when people touched his stuff, especially his @CAPS.Pepper! oh man, god forbid you touch his pop. So seeing @PERSON all jittery and bouncy walking down the aisle gave us girls a wonderful idea, we were going to take his @CAPS. Pepper, and drink it! ok maybe not drink it, but we were for sure going to take the pop from the old man. It's like stealing candy from a baby. We arrived at the hotel and coach told us to upack our stuffso that we could tour the place a bit. So while coach was getting our room keys, we decided that we were going to do a little unpacking for him as well. @PERSON and I took all of his @CAPS.Peppers and stuffed them in our bag and acted like nothing ever happened. We got our keys and he told us that he would stay down and unpack the rest of the things, we didnt want him to do that because he would then realize that we had took his pop, so we immedietly ran to the rooms and threw everything on the floor so that we could come back and make him forget about unpacking and we would go straight to exoeriencing another one of those @LOCATION tours. It wasn't 'till the night time that we arrived back to the hotel and @PERSON hadn't said a single word about his @CAPS.Peppers. We thought we were the coolest people ever! it was already late so we had no other choice but to head up to our rooms and stay there. We all thought that was kind of lame because none of us girls we tired, not even @PERSON, and she raced in the morning. She was the rebel one out of all of us by the way. Tme passed and we were all still awake, we were absolutely bored and had nothing to do, so we decided that we would unpack @PERSON's pop. We starred them down as if they were some prized possesion or something. We thought about drinking them, but that would have been bad. We couldn't leave our room or start a rave, therefore, we just decided to hit the sheets and get some shut eye because the morning was going to be big for us girls and coach. It was the morning that the second biggest race of @PERSON's life was going to take place, and ... we were still in bed! of course @PERSON got up before everyone. We were awakened by a loud knock, we figured it would be @PERSON because who else would it be. We opened the door and big old bald man was standing there and said "" i'm only going to say this once"". I need my @CAPS.Pepper. It was so funny we acted like we didn't know what he was talking about. We found it hilarious because old bald man was turning beet red, apparently he didn't find it funny. We kind of sorta in a way found that out when he pulled the @PERSON not racing card, we were terrified for our lives!, especially @PERSON, since she was the one that was going to be racing. We played the dumb people for about five minutes until he actually was being serious, then we decided to play the nice guys. Yes, we gave him back his @CAPS.Pepper. We learned a very valuable lesson that day, ""messing with @PERSON is like messing with a pig, you're both going to get messy, but the pig likes it""",18,18,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0

We are always making each other and people around us laugh. @CAPS you put two or more @CAPS's together someone is going to start cracking up.

The @CAPS starts out with one person standing in froung of everone else thats playing. The goal of the @CAPS is to try to get one of the other people to start @CAPS, and the first one to laugh has to trade places with them to do the same thing. We really dont play that often just @CAPS their'se nothing else to do. One night my two nefues and I were just siting around looking for something to do @CAPS my little nefue @PERSON said ""@CAPS play the @CAPS @CAPS"". His older brother @PERSON and I didnt really want to play but there was nothing else to do so we bouth said that we would. It started out like it always did nobody really wanted to go first, but @CAPS sombody finly maned up and just went. @CAPS it got started. After that everbody was @CAPS and having a good time. It went on like this for a while, but after about a houre or so it started to get boaring. @PERSON and I were strating to get board out of our minds so we were going to ouit, but my little nefue didnt want us to. @PERSON went up to take a turn. @CAPS @PERSON went up for his turn, he started out like he usually did just making stupid faces and funny sounds to try to get people to laugh. We had seen all of his faces and herd all of his noises so it wasnt going to work. @CAPS after he realised that we wernt going to laugh he started telling us a story. He started the story out by saying ""@CAPS this guy right; he didnt have anything besides his chair and his box. He loved his chair and his box."" The story wasnt very funny yet but he went with it. ""@CAPS the guy went to bed because he was tired and all, and @CAPS he woke up his stuff was gone. His chair and his box the only two things that he had in this world were gone. So he went looking for his things. He was searching all day and night but he couldnt find anything not his chair, his box, or even a clue of where they could have gone. So he disides to go to bed and maybe they would be back in the morning like maybe it was all a dream; but @CAPS he woke up he had turned into a wild boar."" @CAPS he said that @PERSON started running around acting like a pig. That got us @CAPS but he didnt want to stop there he just kept telling his story. In the story it turnd out that everytime the ""guy"" went to bed something strange would change and it just got more and more funny. My family loves to laugh and have others laugh with us. Just like my nefue @PERSON he didnt want to stop telling his story because he had us cracking up. Weather were just hanging out and telling a couple of joaks or making up a @CAPS we love to laugh.

I asked him trying that puppy dog face my sister always makes to get what she wants.Only if @CAPS stop making that weird face at me, do @CAPS want to drive? He asked me as we walked out the door to go pick up @PERSON.Yes please, I said as he flipped me the keys.Pulling into @PERSON's drive way i shut off the truck and stuffing the keys into my left front pocket i walked into @PERSON's house. Walking into it i knocked on the wall and two heads turned to look up at me. One my best friend @PERSON a sandy short hair boy with a white face and the other was the birthday boy @PERSON who much like @PERSON had the same hair color but had pink rose cheeks. I thought i would fine @CAPS here i said . What's this adventure @CAPS taking me on today he asked? @CAPS will see soon enough i replied now throw on some shorts and get a crappy pair of shows I will be out in @CAPS living room watching the @ORGANIZATION win there game when @CAPS done. So leaving @PERSON and @PERSON to change I waited outside @PERSON's room. Alright, said @PERSON we're ready now tell us. Not yet I replied with a mischievous grin on my face. @PERSON yelled goodbye to his mom as he closed the door behind us and we headed for the truck were my @CAPS was still waiting. So @PERSON said to my @CAPS as he got into the back seat do @CAPS know what @CAPS son is going to make us do today? Yes but @CAPS will probably want this one to be a surprise. Well why is there a canoe on top of the truck, are @CAPS going fishing @PERSON? @PERSON asked as he climbed in next to @PERSON. HA I wished laughed my pa as I started up his truck. Pulling out of @PERSON's driveway I headed off towards the bridge and out of town, going straight towards @PERSON. Turning into @PERSON I found a parking spot on the other side of an old car and shut off the truck, I tossed the keys to my @CAPS saying I don't think @CAPS will want me to @CAPS these in my pockets I said to my pa. There was only one other person there a drunk man waving a beer bottle around and sitting on a log. Putting the canoe into the water i tossed each person a paddle and said row to the other bank.

12573,21114,8," Have you ever been laughing at something that someone said, and then began laughing harder at, not the joke, but at a person whose laugh was almost more humorous than the joke itself? Then were you put into a good mood after the funny laughing occurred, when just before that you could have been in the world's worst mood? Laughter is the cure for almost anything from being in a bad mood to crying because you're sad. It can also help make the mood in the room brighter or simply it makes any awkward moment disappear. One bright @DATE day, @PERSON called me and asked if I wanted to long board down to @PERSON's and get some lunch with her. Of course I wanted to because I'm always up for my typical @PERSON's order of a chocolate malt milkshake and some croutons and ranch. I jogged to her house down the block and we long boarded down to @PERSON's in downtown @CAPS. On the way to @PERSON's I shared with @PERSON how I had not had a good day so far and how I needed to be cheered up. She was feeling the same way. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION's we were both excited to get seated so we could catch up with each others lives and eat. When we walked inside we noticed how crowded it seemed to be that day as we waited for a table. After getting seated we noticed an older couple sitting in the booth behind us, some kids from our school in the booth front of us, and a man and women across the aisle. @PERSON ordered a strawberry milkshake and a burger with fries, and I ordered my usual. After the lady took our order and left, @PERSON and I started telling each other the reasons for our bad moods. She was in a bad mood because her friend @PERSON was not treating her right. I was in a bad mood because my friend @CAPS was mad at me for something that never happened.  We were both quite upset and frankly we were in no laughing mood. When all of a sudden we heard what sounded like a mixture of a goose's honking and a donkey's braying. We turned around to find it was a lady's laughter. I looked at @LOCATION and she looked at me and we started busting up laughing. This went on for about @NUM minutes straight. We both could not believe a sound like that could come out of any human being's mouth and it was probably the loudest laugh I've ever heard. We also loved the fact that all of this is happening at a public place with all these people around, and the lady was just setting herself up for being made fun of. @PERSON and I continued to laugh at the lady for how she was laughing and it somehow started to relieve our bad moods. @PERSON started smiling a little more and as for me, I couldn't stop smiling and laughing.   Laughter has an unusual way of putting people in a good mood or relieving them of their bad moods. Regardless if the laugh is a normal little chuckle or an unnatural sound coming out of someone's mouth, laughter brings people together and it's great way to turn a awkward moment into a memorable moment. Someone once said, ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and that person knew what they were talking about.",20,19,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12574,21115,8," There are many reasons why laughter is an important part of any relationship. In my opinion you can no be serious about everything. Laughing is a way of lettting yourself go and relieve stress. Laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other. Laughter can help in many more ways then that.  Being serious about everything is not always a good thing. You need to have fun in your life to keep you happy. Being around people that make you laugh is always a good way to put yourself into a good mood. Laughing is a good way to take the pressure off and not be ebarressed. Being able to have a realtionship with people where you can laugh at things when they are funny is always needed. For me i know that being around people who cant laugh things off i always feel like i need to watch what i say. Laughing is one of the best way to just relax. Laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other. If i do not feel like i can joke around and laugh with the people that i am with i usually do not feel like i can be myself. Altough if you are not comfortable with the people that you are with to start with then it might be harder for you to joke around with them. Eventually if you let yourself go and laugh you will feel closer to them. Being happy and laughing with people makes a really strong connection between people. Making things into a joke is a way alot of people keep their selfs from getting embarssed. Usually if you do something that other people think is funny and you dont, then if people laugh you might feel uncomfotable. But if you start to laugh with them it takes the pressure off you and they are not longer laughing at you but now with you.  In conclusion there are many things that laughing can do for you. It makes it so you dont have to be serious about everything, it takes the pressure off and relieves stress. Laughing is one of the best things that people can do together to make a connection. No matter what laughing can always put someone in a better mood.",17,15,0.0,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.0
12575,21116,8," What is one of the most important parts of a relationship? Laughter would be one of the most important part of a relationship in my mind. Such as my relationship with @PERSON, and @ORGANIZATION. We are always laughing almost every moment we are together someones is always making a joke. But when we are all together cheering is the funniest for example when our varsity cheer squad went to @LOCATION. We got locked out of our bus then we got kick out of a @ORGANIZATION. Last but not lest we had the funniest @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS, that night we will never be forgotten. When we first arrived at @LOCATION our couch left the keys on the bus after we locked it all up. One of the girls noticed when she went out to get her ipod. We all tried to think of some ways out of this. We first tried to put @PERSON through the window. But that unfortunately did not work so well because we could not get any of the windows open. Our couch had to call someone to bring us another set of keys.  After the game our cheer squad went to @ORGANIZATION. Because before the game she promised we could go to get some cookie dough if we were good and didn't complain about having to sit on the stands and cheer. When pulled up to @ORGANIZATION @PERSON and I ran out of the bus screaming as loud as we could. One of the people who worked at @ORGANIZATION said that we could not run in the building. We followed the rules and started doing cartwheels and round offs down the halls instead. We got stopped again and they didn't mean do cartwheels or round offs down the halls either. as we were walking around to find the music box we stumbled onto a baby stroller so we took turns pushing each other in it. Turns out that's not allowed in @ORGANIZATION either. We got sent back to our coach. Unfortunate for us we stumbled on to another interesting thing it was a short little dresses on a clothing rack. @PERSON and I put them over our cheer uniforms. As @PERSON was about to take a picture a girl who worked there came up behind us. @PERSON the good friend she is ran off with out telling us. @PERSON decides to take the picture instead, after the lady saw what we were doing we got kicked out.  The last crazy event of the night was the @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS. For thous of you who don't know what that is it is simply when a bus stops at a stop light and everyone besides the driver of course gets out and runs around the bus like crazy people. We were just about to leave @LOCATION when the light turns red. I was standing by the door waiting for a light to turn red. i had to beg our couch to let us out as soon as she opened the door I ran out as fast as I could. Sadly the the road was all muddy which caused me to fall straight onto my butt. Two other people were behind me and they helped me up and then we ran around the bus. But the light turned green as soon as I rounded the corner. The people behind us were passing and we were getting honked at and not in the good way either. Honestly no body cared we were having so much fun to even think about the other people. As @CAPS another girl from the squad rounded the corner she fell straight onto her face. Then when everyone was back on the bus the light turned red again. we waited on the bus for it to turn green. @CAPS and I were covered in mud. Everyone one was taking the mud off of @CAPS and I then put it on them self's. But since everybody was rubbing the mud it just got really dry and uncomfortable.  In conclusion laughter is an important part of a relationship. With out it our squad wouldn't have half the funny memories we do. That night was just one of the most funniest all of the things that happened that night were just so humorous. Including getting locked out of the bus, getting kicked out of @ORGANIZATION, and the best of all the @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS. That night will never be forgotten by me or any of the other people that were there.",17,20,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12576,21118,8," From birth to young adulthood, kids are raised by their guardians or parents. It is the parent's responsibility to convey to their children good morals, life skills, and to teach them how to cope and thrive in society. @CAPS parenting children requires being firm and strictly reinforcing rules. The result of this however, is the child leaves their parents prepared to live their adult lives outside the home.It is safe to say that although I am a still a teenager, I have learned quite a lot about raising kids. My knowledge mostly being based off of stories passed down to me by my parents and grandparents about their life lessons. Being ""in on"" these small, yet significant bits of history is quite enjoyable for me. I'd have to say that although many of the facts about the ""good old days"" are great, it is the almost tangible memories which my family connects with laughter that are the most significant to me. My @CAPS grew up in the @DATE's living in a small yet average sized house with her @CAPS, @CAPS, and four brothers and sisters. The main subject which is the focus of the stories my @CAPS retells about her childhood come from memories made at the dinner table. It was her @CAPS's (my @CAPS's) goal, for his children to learn proper manners and standard etiquette. It was expected of the @PERSON children to practice this by being calm, courteous, and mindful of their physical actions when gathered around the table for dinner. For an average, fun, causal, and not so dignified @CAPS family, that was a lot to ask. Throughout their childhood my @CAPS and her siblings tried their very best to behave and do as they were told at the dinner table. The only common occurrence that was particularly displeasing to my @CAPS was when someone spilled their milk. This fateful event happened almost every night. When milk was spilled it was either the cause of a child engaging in funny business, or it was a result of reaching to far to retrieve the butter dish. Whatever the reason, it was somehow hysterically funny when this occurred. The only catch was, that laughing at the table was frowned upon for it seemed to break the formal mood the family strove for during the evening meal. Laughing and spilling milk were two actions not encouraged at the dinner table. Spilling milk did not continue to happen as often as the children grew up, but that is not to say that is discontinued it's presence at the dinner table completely. One night it was not my @CAPS nor any of her siblings that spilled their milk. Instead, it was my @CAPS. When the initial incident occurred, the whole family was in a state of shock. In effort to clean up the mess everyone donated their napkin, while their @CAPS maintained a controlled but disgruntled demeanor. When all was cleaned up, the family went on with their meal and on my @CAPS's face was a subtle yet unmistakable grin. Years later my @CAPS (@PERSON), @PERSON, @CAPS @CAPS, @PERSON, and @PERSON @CAPS grew up, got married, and some even began families of their own. Most of my @CAPS's family lives in @LOCATION so they enjoyed coming up to visit their @CAPS and @CAPS (my @CAPS and @CAPS) at the holidays or whenever they were able. During these times when the entire family is able to gather here in @LOCATION, there is hardly ever a somber or serious moment at the dinner table. As my @CAPS would say, ""@CAPS we laugh so hard that tears run down our legs.""  I attribute to the fun we have together to this bond of love that connects us all, and I feel it would not be as prominent without the element of laughter. I feel that my @CAPS (who is now in heaven with @CAPS), accomplished the goal of preparing his children for life. Now that they are all grown up, they can let loose, enjoy each others company, and feel free to bust out in laughter even if there is a risk of someone spilling their milk.",22,26,48.0,48,0.0,0.0,0.0,48.0
12577,21119,8," Laughter leads to happiness. Happiness is a key to life. Laughing is a communication click with life, it brings you a warm feeling inside @CAPS you laugh. Think about it. For example, @CAPS you go on your first date with this wonderful guy that you are so excited but yet nervous because you don't know how he is going to act. You have all these thoughts going through your mind like, will he like what I'm wearing? Will he think I'm beautiful? What do i talk about? and trust me i bet you he is think the exact same things you are. You get to the restaurant and hes a gentlemen, he pulls your chair out for you and comes off sweet as can be. The first thing he dose is make you laugh. Laughing really changes things doesn't it? makes you feel you know comfortable.    Now lets take it back. You show up with guy he says, ""hello"" you sit down and he talks about the most boring subjects, doesn't smile talks kinda of quiet, makes you bring up all the subjects to talk about.Witch couple do you think is more likely to go forward? The first example right? laughing lights up everything smiling makes people happy and it feels comforting.   laughter and smiles i know falls under the same category i mean @CAPS you smile your happy. @CAPS you laugh you have to smile and usually @CAPS your laughing your happy about something or someone. i love @CAPS people make me laugh and smile it makes you feel like everything's going to be ok, @PERSON @CAPS it's not. people don't realize part of communication is smiling and laughter, they kinda ignore and come as kinda, well ya know boring witch makes a person no fun at all. Everyone has to have some joy in there life, and if not there are people out there that can help.  Do you notice gloomy people? People that are sad all the time kind of afraid of life? Maye been through a lot of hard times. Gosh I cant even imagine what some people are going through what some people are going through these days but anyway, smile lightens there heart. Makes them feel just maybe not much but better than they were feeling. just by passing on a face showing that you don't know them but maybe you can feel that there not doing well, or are hurting.   I work at a restaurant in my town here in @LOCATION as a waitress. I love my job and i enjoy making people smile and laugh, it makes them feel comfortable. This lady walked in my work and it was a late after noon. She we looking around at all the other customers, but it wasn't the people that were sitting with here sisters or brothers even kids. It was the couples she was looking at she looked very unhappy and it seemed to me that she probably was in a divorcee or break up she just looked very sad. knowing myself all i wanted to do was help her even put a smile on her face because i care. I went over to her table and sat down by here, remember i don't even know this lady. I looked at her and said "" you know everything is going to be alright"" and smiled at her. Within seconds her face lit up it was like the whole restaurant had lit up. She put a smile on her face. You know its the little things in life that make everything ok.

12578,21120,8," When I think of laughter, I think back to the wonder years. Although the memories are foggy, i can still recall the times where I believed friendship had no end and that laughter was the common cure to every battle. Thinking back to the @DATE I was twelve, I remember @CAPS adventures pushing me upward towards the sky. Free spirited and lacking reality, I was an unstoppable soul. I was @CAPS alone though. Through adventures and explorations, I brought @CAPS trustworthy opponent. Her name was @PERSON and she was @CAPS best friend.  @PERSON lived out in the country, where the grass grew tall and the land came in acres. Through forests and streams, you could find our hideaway from the world; We called @CAPS our wonderland. Now, the small stream with a bridge is nothing but a forgotten place. On a typical @DATE @TIME in @DATE, I drove up to @PERSON to @PERSON's house. Walking in her front door, I automatically smelled fresh cinnamon scones drizzled with honey. The sweet smell sent shivers up @CAPS spine. @PERSON came down the stairs and greeted me with a hug. She wore her long, dark hair in braids and was wearing a white sundress. Her brown, shimmering skin glittered against the sunlight and her dark brown eyes sent me a happy glare. I envied her with @CAPS heart and soul. Next to her, i was just the simple, blond girl with a blotchy skin tone. In one moment, she fled to the window and looked out at the perfect, blue ski. ""@CAPS wow, finally @DATE has come along,"" she whispered and then exploded,"" @CAPS another day spent with grumpy, sleepless peers and no more stuffy classrooms or annoying teachers. @CAPS.. its the first day of many!"" We burst into laughter as I made fun of her poetic outburst, but we both new every word of @CAPS was true. Sighing, I looked at her breathtaking, dress one last time and ran out to the field in her backyard. @PERSON grabbed a red cardigan and followed me, holding a basket in her hand as if she were little red riding hood.  I frolicked through the meadow like I was a radiant fox chasing after its pray. When I stopped for breath, i encountered the wind blowing the tall, wispy grass in rhythmic motions around me. Racing towards our secret place, I looked back only once to to find @PERSON. As I turned towards @CAPS destination again, a branch met @CAPS vision and knocked me down painfully. Blood trickled down @CAPS chin and left crimson droplets of blood in the green grass. I breathed in, choking on the salty fluid and then realized she was standing there. Like a worried hare, @PERSON sprang to @CAPS side and helped me to the house. We made our way into the upstairs bathroom.   Standing at her bathroom sink, I wept small tears. In the mirror I could see a belligerent looking girl with a bloody slash across her chin and red, misted eyes. The pain was @CAPS @CAPS made me cry; @CAPS was @CAPS appearance that had me down. People would asked for days ""@CAPS is on your face"" and ""@CAPS! How did that @NUM came to @CAPS side and squeaked, ""@CAPS, how are you?""@CAPS face turned to a bright shade of red in a way that I might explode. I turned to @PERSON and in one fluid breath I burst out, ""@CAPS! Wonderful! Ecstatic! Before this, I had a boring, simple look going. Now, I will look even worse with this terrible blemish! I hate how gorgeous you are @PERSON. You are exotic, distinguished and everything about you seems extremely, perfect!""@CAPS friend just stood there and took in every word. A confused look came across her face but slowly turned to a crooked grin. Suddenly, @PERSON burst out into laughter. Embarrassed, I walked to the door wanting to leave that very second, but she grew silent and look hold of @CAPS arm. Shaking her off, I continued down the stairs. ""@CAPS,"" she called out to me, "" I'm @CAPS agreeing with you in anyway. @CAPS, you @MONTH have a small cut across your chin, but you have always been beautiful and I feel like a simple, field mouse next to you. The way your blond, thin hair becomes perfect ringlets and the way your freckles highlight your amazing, turquoise eyes. I have always been jealous of you! That's why I'm laughing!"" I took this in for a second and then erupted into laughter. Racing up the stairs, I came to her with a big, bear hug and laughed some more. Everything I had ever thought about her beauty and mine, wasn't at all relevant. Having thought this, the pain of @CAPS cut became apparent to me. Lee, her dad, fixed me up with his sewing skills and each stitch, I laughed along with @PERSON to get through the pain. Seven stitches and a nasty scar, remind me everyday that laughter gets you through the worst while @CAPS builds an everlasting, friendship.     ",25,25,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0
12579,21122,8," The wind rose and fell, whipping against the side of the house with full force. My mom said she had never seen such a fierce storm before in her life. It shook the house making it creak in odd places, like the floor boards. My @CAPS @PERSON sat at the kitchen table contemplating, worrying. They had rental houses acres off that were surrounded by trees, the ground was so soft ,so saturated by the rain and flooding that had taken over the valley. There were already hundreds of trees that had come uprooted there were bound to be more. The little homesteads that rested off of @LOCATION @CAPS including my papa's were well built weathered farm houses,most were surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of acres of land. You would be surprised to find someone out there with less then @NUM acres of land. It's wheat fields mostly, but you can easily find fields of corn, alfalfa, you'll find rows and rows of blueberries so big only @NUM can fit on the palm or your hand. It is literally paradise on earth, a small piece of heaven that was thrown down to earth by either accident or purposely. The sun is so bright and the sky is the clearest, most crisp blue. When weather rolls in giant fluffy clouds make the sky look like it's dappled with giant pieces of cotton. All this stretches over land so flat you wonder if it could possibly be real. I have spent so many wonderful , laughter filled summers there. Running bare foot through the fields, playing in the large expansion of lush, green grass. Feeding the goats, chickens, and pigs with my siblings. On @DATE my mom said she had never seen a place so beautiful turn so ugly in such a short period of time. My mom says if she had known what was going to happen that day she never would have let them get in that car. My papa, @CAPS, and @CAPS @PERSON pulled out of the driveway. Since it was a small car my @CAPS volunteered to ride in the back. The storm had been showing it's vicious temper for over two hours, and it showed no signs of letting up. They had set out to see what damage had been done on their acres of land, to see what needed fixing once this storm moved on over the mountains. There is no explanation, no one understood why my @CAPS walked away with not even a scratch on his body. No one knows how the tree fell or why it only landed on the back end of the car, but it did. Gods hand had swept down and caused destruction. My @CAPS was killed instantly, my papa was seriously injured but alive. He spent weeks in the hospital, during those weeks the news of the accident spread like wildfire as news does in a small town. Everyone loved my @CAPS, she was social butterfly that fluttered from person to person , laughing, talking , sharing tears, and joy. She knew everybody, and everybody knew her. The heavens cried and howled that day, rain drops fell so heavily it felt as if the whole world was crying, crying just for you just to share your grief. It's painful, to lose someone so dear to your heart. My papa cried, he sobbed until he had no strength left to feel any emotion at all. he loved her so much, he needed her . Lightning struck the giant oak that stood tall and proud in my papa's backyard that day. It was the same tree that held my grandparents initials. The lightning split the top of the giant oak clean in two. Everyone saw it as a symbol, sign of how my papa and @CAPS had been struck apart quickly and forcefully. But, days before my papa returned home from the hospital, my dad climbed that giant oak and chained the severed part back together. With that my dad had made a symbol of his own, saying you will always be together just not physically, but you will never be truly apart. The day my papa returned home he saw the giant oak, and for the first time in weeks a glimmer of understanding shone in his eyes. A small amount of hope had settled over everything once again. Her funeral was a nice affair, elegant, simple, beautiful, just like her. The whole town came, they reminisced for hours, telling stories about my @CAPS and her crazy yet lovable nature. Then from across the room it came. Small at first then growing ever louder. Laughter. A smile, yes there were tears with that laughter, but it was laughter all the same I've never seen the saying "" laughter is the best medicine"" put to justice better. My @CAPS was one person who saw laughter, love, faith and hope as necessities in life. She brought joy to so many people, and now they were returning the favor.",25,21,0.0,46,0.0,0.0,0.0,46.0
12580,21123,8," When we were little it was watching @CAPS. In junior high, it was seeing a kid squirt milk out through his nose. But now as we approach our high school years, we stifle giggles, suppress outbursts, and laugh until we cry, for our own reasons; and we can't hold back the inevitable urge to laugh. Some say laughing is the best medicine, unfortunately for my sister an I, this was not the case; laughing just got us in more trouble. No matter how many times we were lectured, someone always found their way back into the other one's room purely because we were nosy. I remember back a few summers ago, I'd seen @PERSON, my sister, putting a bag of chocolate under her mattress. There was a possibility it was gone, but I had no doubt in my mind that it was still there. But as the mattress was lifted up and as I was beginning to reach for it, the bed was shoved back down, very nearly smashing my fingers. there stood @PERSON with a vindictive look in her eyes and two hands placed on her hips. What could I say? What could I do? A shill scream escaped my lips and I bolted for door before she could unleash her wrath upon me. Up the stairs, around the couch, through the kitchen I ran; but not fast enough. Before I could lock myself in the bathroom, she caught my ponytail and yanked, hard. I was in for a nine year old, hair pulling, all-@CAPS beating. But lucky me, no more harm could be done because my @CAPS had heard my scream and had come to investigate. Fighting was taboo in our house, but that never stopped us. @CAPS's punishments were minuscule, we could hug and make up, or stand in the corner. The anger in @LOCATION's eyes was already gone, and a certain, significant smile played across her lips. @CAPS was still trying to play the strict parent, but to us, the passed four minutes were just a joke now.  ""@CAPS,""she had said, one word, one meaning, that's all it took. We exploded in a roar of giggles and laughter. Although there was no way @CAPS could have known this, we meant no disrespect, but be couldn't keep silent. Boisterous laughs rang through the hallway, so loud, @CAPS's words were inaudible. Grabbing our hands and pulling us towards the living room we were half dragged because we were shaking to hard. Ten feet apart we stood, eyes focused on the ninety degree angle in front of our noses. But one look at each other and sent another tremor of giggles through our little bodies. We could have been inebriated if you didn't now any better, but really we were just two rambunctious kids playing around. We all have our reasons to laugh. Maybe your reason is as simple as reading an e-mail that made laugh so hard you cried. Maybe it is because my amateur writing style is a joke to you, or maybe you too have just witnessed a child's nose spew chocolate milk. We all have things in our life that make us want to roll on the floor, or slap our knees; but from my experience it's excruciatingly hard to hold back, so let it out.",20,23,0.0,43,0.0,0.0,0.0,43.0

We knew how would get there but we didn't know how we were going to get back, but knowing us we didn't care we just wanted to have fun. we had lot's of fun hanging out but then it started getting dark we needed a ride back home. Later on I decited to call my dad to see if he would come and get us. Knowing my dad he thought it was really funny that my friend and I were stuck in @LOCATION, so he started laughing. After he was still laughing I asked so can you come get us cause its getting ready dark and he said no, cause it's not his fault that I was stuck there. So @PERSON said ""why don't I call my dad to see if he would"" and so she did but just like my dad he also started laughing and said no. Later on @PERSON and I ran out of people who to call. So we said to each other why don't we worry about his later it's really not that dark and we can all still hang out for a while longer. After i thought that throw I knew we should start worry about because later on it well get even more darker then it already is and then we diffidently wont have a ride home. So I told @PERSON that we should keep on trying people while we hang out with our friends more, but she didn't care so much. I made a call to my sister @PERSON to see if she would do me the favor of picking us up from @LOCATION. I called and call her but she wouldn't pick up her phone. An hour past and we still couldn't think of someone, but then I thought to my self maybe my other sister @CAPS she always does favors for me, I called her and I asked her if she could and she said yes ill be there in @NUM minuets to pick you guys up. So I went to go tell @PERSON the great news that I got us a ride home and we don't have to worry about it anymore. When I went back to the park she wasn't there any more I thought she went to the bathroom, so I went to checked the bathroom for her but she was not there also. I thought to my self where could she of gone. I started to get really worried about were she went so I walked around and looked for her. So I looked at my clock and saw that my sister was going to be here in ten minuet, before I realized she was at the store getting food and she didn't tell me. I got really mad at her for not telling me where she went, but I thought to myself it didn't matter so why was I going to make a big deal about it and then I heard someone beep and it was my sister @CAPS I got really happy to see her cause all I thought of is going home and sleeping all night and all day. We got in the car and my sister asked why didn't I call my dad for a ride? I told her I did but he didn't want to pick me up because if I could get here then why couldn't get back home. She started laughing at me and thought it was the most funniest thing my dad has ever done. After we dropped of my friend @PERSON, we went out to eat to burger king and got two salads to go. When I got home my dad asked who brought me and I told him my sister went and got me and took me out to eat. After being stuck in @LOCATION so long and not having a way to get I just went to my room and went to bed because it was a very long day for me and my pore little feet. The next morning I didn't wake up until @NUM in the @TIME. My dad thought i need to wake up already so he went it my room and woke me up and told me i need to eat and get fresh air. I woke up and took a shower and eat some food and took a very short walk because my feet were still hurting from yesterday. when I went on my walk I was thinking about how I shouldn't of just gone to @LOCATION with out making sure I had a ride back home, but I was very thankful for my sister going out of her way to pick me up and not get mad or even yelled at me. when I got back home I called my sister and told her that I was really thankful for her going to go get me and my friend and even taking me out to eat.",12,15,0.0,27,0.0,0.0,0.0,27.0
12582,21127,8,"It was a normal sunny day in the country hill's of @ORGANIZATION. The sun was out and shineing on the creek that me, my twin brother and my best friend were swimming in. The creek was fantastic. It was a deep swimming hole that all the neighborhood kids would swim in. Since all the other kids were either too old and busy to swim, or they were too young it was just us three that swam in the creek that @DATE. We loved it. It helped cool us down during the heat of the day. We would play games like @PERSON, and tag in the water. There was even a rope swing off the little brigde that one of the older kids made. The swimming hole was the place to be that @DATE.  Eventually we got hungry and tired of swimming in the hole for a while. There was this trail we would use to walk back to my house. The trail was the fastest way to get home. From the trail you could see farm animals grazing in the sun filled fields. The day we walked this trail was a little different then normall. All the farm animals were making noise. One of the farm hands was walking the trail listening for a bell. He said one of his goats had gotten out. He warned us that the goat was alittle mean and if we saw it to keep our distance. So we took the warning and walked on. Once we reached the gravel road that lead to my house, @PERSON said she heard the bell. My brother and I didnt believe her at all. We thought she was playing another joke on us. We walked on for about @NUM seconds. All of the sudden @PERSON screamed run! My brother and i turned around and saw the white goat with big horns chasing us! We ran as fast as we could. I tripped over my feet and fell. I got up as fast i could and sprinted faster. I could tell my adrenaline was up because I was running really fast and i wasn't getting tired. We reached the hotwire fence that surround my house. We all stopped and questioned if we could jump over it or not. The goat was getting closer and closer, we didn't have much time to deside weather we could or not. My brother was the first to jump. Of course he made it and soo did @ORGANIZATION. I was the last one. I started to panic in my head. I backed up alittle and ran and jumped over the fence. I thought i was gonna make it but then my foot caught the fence and i flung over the fence and face planted it. It was super embbarrasing. My friend and brother were both laughing histarically at me. I could tell my face was beat red and i was mad that i fell. Again. Although i still found myself laughing. The goat had stopped at the fence and started to charge it with his horns. That made me jump and run. I dived over a row boat were my brother and friend was and I said oh my lanta that was the funniest most scareiest thing i had experianced all @DATE. We walked up to the house laughing and talking about eachothers faces as we where running and how funny it was that i face planted it. They made fun of the face i made when the goat started to charge the fence. Even though i was embarrased that i tripped over the fence, I still found my self laughing and making fun of myself for what had happened. I would have to say that was the best day all @DATE. We got up to my house and went into the kitchen to find my mom laughing so hard that she was crieing. We all asked her what was soo funny and she said she saw the whole thing from the window. We all started laughing to point we all cried. We all told the story the story to our parents when they all came over for dinner and they laughed and laughed. All of our cheeks hurt by the end of @TIME. Laughing is great. It mends the soul. Plus its a great ab work out!!!!",17,18,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12583,21129,8,"       Laughter In A Relationship The most important thing in a relationship is laughter. Laughter is something we all need and it keeps us going with the world and the duties we do all day because we get frustrated a lot of times. So one thing that helps us is laughter. If someone is upset the person might watched a comedy movie or read a comic about funny or humorous characters. But many people like talking to someone when they are upset and need a uplift from them. When I was once upset regarding my school work and about not having a job. I went out for a walk after an argument with my work mother. About my grades being dropped. My mom got quite angry and my dad was also very upset with me because they knew I was much more capable than I showed in my grades. My parents knew I wanted to do a job to buy things what I wanted. They didn't think it appropriate to linger around about having a job so much and not care about my grades.When I was walking along the lake side I heard someone playing a guitar and he played it so beautifully that I wanted to meet that person instantly. I tried to find him but I couldn't and at last I just set down and wondered who that person might be. So suddenly a boy came to me with a guitar and asked me what time is it. I told him the time and asked him where he learn t to play guitar such beautifully. So he told me that he is interested in playing guitar for a long time and he wants to join a band.We both shared our feeling and we couldn't even understand that the things we never told anyone else we were telling each other  @CAPS after that meeting we came close friends and we met everyday. He knew I was quite tensed so he used to play guitar for me and we sang songs together. He also told me jokes and I knew he was doing all this just for me and I sometimes just kept quite and didn't respond to his jokes. He got more tensed that I was not laughing or smiling. But I didn't realize that by doing this I was really making him hurt.But he never lost hope in me and he kept on telling me funny stories and we talked over the phone whole night just so that he could make my tensions a bit less and make me laugh. So one day he took me out for lunch at @ORGANIZATION's because he knew it was my favorite place and I loved going their. He took me to a comedy movie on superheroes but neither of them were making me laugh. All the time I was just in his arms. But after the movies he took me to the most beautiful place and it was near a beach and the whole place was decorated by colorful lights and we were sitting down on a swing and talking. Now he knew how he could make me happy and he told me jokes and we read comic books and surprisingly I started loving his jokes and the comics we read. Whenever I would meet him he would do something special for me and made me laugh. He once got dressed down as clown and tried to juggle balls but he couldn't do it so well and i laughed at him so badly. I know it was being rude to laugh at him but I loved spending time with him.  One day he came to my home and we were talking and he held my hands and proposed me. I was really happy to hear that and he brought me the most beautiful ring ever. He proposed me and took me out for a drive and gave me some advice in a very respectfully manner, not in a intention that he is putting me down. But I had never seen a person like him and he he told me that laughing and smiling is good for life. N o matter what happens tomorrow why should we care about it today when we have such a beautiful life waiting for us. We must live the way we want and not force our selves to change just to get serious in life. He held my hand and took me his arms and said @CAPS matter how much we love each other but laughter is important in a relationship I looked at him and asked him why'd? So he replied we'd must be happy and to be healthy and to be with each other. After we had some time there he dropped me home and told me live life because who knows if we will be alive tomorrow. From that moment I realized that he was right and I looked at life from a different perspective from that day and decided to live life in a better way so that I laugh and enjoy.",19,17,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12584,21130,8," I used to love hermit crabs. The cute little creatures who hid in their shells fascinated me. When I was about six my family decided to take a road trip along a @CAPS coastline. We were accompanied by another family with four kids. Put together there were @NUM kids for me to play with, but the closest one to my age was @PERSON. He was only a couple years older than me. I adored @PERSON. We explored, swam, giggled, and played tricks on our siblings together. Everything he did, I did.  We went to so many different beaches I can't remember half of them, but one in particular stood out. It was a short and slender beach. On one side there was a cave. The cave was loaded with hermit crabs. Never in my life have I seen so many of them. There were mini hermit crabs, great big hermit crabs, and even bigger hermit crabs! It was as if our dreams had come true. @PERSON and I created sand castles, prisons, and water channels to keep the hermit crabs contained. Our older siblings weren't interested in them at all. That was alright though, in our eyes it only meant more for us!  When it was time to leave, @PERSON and I were devastated. We both knew that we wouldn't just come across another beach like this is the future. It finally hit us that we wouldn't be able to keep our beloved crabs. We stayed down on the beach near the cave for hours just saying our ""good byes"". When my mom eventually yelled across the beach saying that it was time to go, we both had made a quick decision. I had watched girls stuff shells into there bathing suits before. I thought why not? @PERSON liked the idea, so we silently slid two hermit into our swim trunks. His crab in the pocket of his shorts, mine in my one piece swim suit. It sagged at the bottom, but I decided to ignore it and pretend like nothing was wrong. Guilt weighted down my scrawny little body, like I had stuck a ten pound rock in my suit, not a tiny little crab. My mom had asked me directly if I had left all the hermit crabs on the beach. I nodded, but my voice was absent.  Back on the road my sister and I played word games. Everything was fine, the music playing, my parents talking. and our wheels rolling down the narrow dirt road.Every once in a while I would have to move a little because I could feel my little hermit crab checking out his surroundings. We had been driving for about an hour when I let out a blood curdling scream. As my dad slammed on the brakes dust swirled around the car like a hurricane. I remember my mom swiveling in her seat to look at me and ask what was wrong. I didn't answer. As the pincers grabbed on again, I let out another urgent scream. I then decided it was time to quit hiding my little friend in the bottom of my swimsuit. Letting out the last prolonged scream I pointed down to my crotch. My sister's urgent hands pulled my swimsuit off and quickly found the little devil. I was so embarrassed and guilty that my mom just laughed. She said that I had already gotten my punishment for lying, and that she thought I had learned my lesson. I sure wasn't going to disagree on that. A few minutes later, our friends pulled over too. When we asked if everything was okay, they said while laughing, that one of the girls had gotten pinched by @PERSON's hermit crab. That sent all of us laughing.  We never stopped laughing about that story. My family loves to humiliate me in front of friends, guys that I like, or adults that I don't even know. Every time my mother says that that crab grabbed right onto ""where it counts"" we all bust out laughing. And every time I turn tomato red in embarrassment, but I guess I deserve it.  @PERSON and I both learned our lessons, although I think I learned a few extra lessons. First of all, never put and animal near your ""sensitive"" parts. The second lesson was don't lie, because eventually you will most likely be be caught and punished. The last lesson would have to be to learn how to enjoy something when you have it and when it is time to let it go, let whatever it is let it go, and be grateful for the time you got to enjoy it. If I would have been able to just say good bye to my shelled friends, I would have never lied or felt so much pain. They were all great lessons to learn, and I am very grateful for them. Not only because I became a little wiser, but also because I have a great story to tell that always sends people up in laughter.",25,20,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12585,21131,8," Laughter is huge part of life. Or so that is what I believe and grew up with. ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day."" @CAPS quote has greatly influenced my life. As well as the people in my life.  My mother is quite the entertainer. People have told her that she should become a comedian. Apparently our family stories are very amusing. Mostly because they involve my brother in some way or another. He's adventurous, spontaneous, and is not afraid of anything. Sometimes his decisions are not the smartest. A majority of the stories my mom talks about are from when my brother was little. She loves to talk about one in particular.   When my brother was younger he liked to take part in adrenaline based activities. Like extreme rollerblading, biking, and skateboarding. He would try to do every trick in the book and then some. @CAPS story, however, does not include him getting hurt or someone else getting hurt. Which is surprising because it seemed like every day he would injure himself or his best friend @CAPS.  When I was about eight or nine, putting my brother at age eleven or twelve, we were at one of my soccer games. My brother had to use the bathroom and when he came back, my mom was not pleased. He went to use the port-o-potty and he had just gotten two new shirts; a white t-shirt to go under a new button-up. It was a hot afternoon, so he took off his new white t-shirt but kept on the button-up. Unfortunately, he dropped the white shirt. He dropped it into the rancid, disgusting excrement. If @CAPS ask him, it was all an accident and my mom was not happy about it.  My mom is the person in the family who thoroughly enjoys laughter. I think about her words of wisdom all the time, ""@CAPS when it seems like nothing can get better, think of the positives in your life and laugh. Because really, that's all @CAPS can do. If @CAPS embarrass yourself in front of a lot of people @CAPS need to laugh it off. If @CAPS can laugh about it, it won't matter if anyone else does."" @CAPS need to get through life somehow. Might as well make it the best, and laughter is truly the best. It makes my mood better, and makes me feel welcome and at home.    There are many stories about what my brother did, or how blond I am. But ultimately, all that matters is that we can laugh about something every day. It brings us closer. ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day.""  ",20,15,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0

Me @PERSON my friends, @PERSON, went to @LOCATION to do a cultural performance at @ORGANIZATION. When we were done we started heading back home. @PERSON kept complaining about needing to use a restroom.

By the time we got to @ORGANIZATION was doint the potty dance. @PERSON @PERSON I got in line to order ice cream cones dipped in chocolate. While we were waiting @PERSON was searching for the restroom. After approximately four minutes of searching, @PERSON finally asked the lady working behind the counter where the bathroom was. She handed @PERSON a key with a large bulky wreath attached to it @PERSON told her it was outside behind the building. @PERSON took the key @PERSON sprinted to what appeared to be double dorrs. Little did @PERSON know that only the left door opens. She ran straight into the right door @PERSON fell over. we all started cracking up laughing... Especially @PERSON. She laughed so hard that she didn't quite make it to the restroom. Instead she had an ""accident"" on the floor in @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION.

As usual on the weekends, most of the family was over; as well as some friends. I was just a little girl who loved everyone and everything, especially laughing. Anyone could make me laugh, smile and have a good time. One person, however, could make me laugh for hours straight. That person was my @CAPS.  My @CAPS, @PERSON, came over to hang out with the rest of the family and friends that were at my house. He was talking, laughing, and having a really good time. Of course, I was only about five or six years old at the time; but to me, aside from my dad, my @CAPS was the coolest person in the world. That @TIME, I was playing with my friends and not really paying attention to all of the adults. All of a sudden, my @CAPS came up to me, gave me a big hug and started to talk to me. I was so happy. Since I loved to joke around and laugh, I was thrilled to have all the attention. I used to call them laugh attacks. Anytime my @CAPS talked to me, I started laughing and I would laugh so hard that I couldn't stop. That @TIME, I had one of them. My @CAPS and I were joking around and making fun of each other. Then, out of nowhere, I realized that I was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. @CAPS went on for about an hour straight. That was long after my @CAPS left and went back to the adults. My friend, @LOCATION, sat next to me and tried to get me to stop laughing. She was laughing too, but not as much as me.  Finally, after a long hour or so, I got myself to calm down. The rest of the @TIME was great but every so often, I started to laugh again. There was absolutely no way that I was going to stop giggling until I went to bed. After a long @TIME of having a good time, everyone left and went home. When my @CAPS came to say goodbye to me, I was upset that he was leaving, but I knew that I would see him again. The next day, I was right about being able to stop laughing. I still smiled and hung out with my family, but I wasn't laughing uncontrollably.    My @CAPS was and still is a huge part of my life. He is always the person that can make me laugh and forget about all of my worries. Even though I don't live near him anymore, I can still talk to him on the phone and laugh and joke around with him. When I go visit him down in @LOCATION, @CAPS seems like we just pick things up where they left off. We don't even think about the fact that we haven't seen each other in a really long time.   When my dad passed away, my @CAPS was always there for me. He is the one male figure that I still have in my life. After everything that I've gone through, I could always count on him to brighten the mood and make me laugh, or at least smile. People really do need a person like my @CAPS in their lives. @CAPS really does help to know that you have someone that loves you and can brighten your day. All you have to do is talk to him. My relationship with my @CAPS is very close, and the one thing that kept @CAPS that way is all of the laughs that we have shared through the years. Laughter is a huge part of anyone's life. I have grown up around laughter and the thought of always being happy. Throughout my life, I have had to deal with pain, loss, and sadness. However, after everything that I have come through, I can always come out laughing. When I was eleven years old, my dad passed away. At an even younger age, my parents got divorced. No matter how much those things hurt me, I never stopped laughing and moving on with my life.",20,15,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12588,21134,8,"                             laughter @CAPS funny, normally when i fall of line, for some reason @CAPS humorous to me. I'm laughing in my head the hole way down down a rapid.I've taken plenty of beat downs whale I have been kayaking, @CAPS i think that my day running the upper stretch of the white salmon might have been my worst beat down yet. I like to call that day the @CAPS beat down. @CAPS was a very nice day and I felt like @CAPS would just be a normal day on the upper white salmon, @CAPS oh I was wrong. The bad news started as soon as @PERSON, @PERSON and I parked the car. @PERSON had brought the wrong size spray skirt for his creek boat. I had no doubt that we could conquer this problem. the spray skirt ended up barely fitting, @CAPS took the strength of all three of us to get @CAPS on. After a long hike through an empty creek bed we found our selves at the put in. This is a fairly simple put in, you start off with finding a faltish spot on a @NUM foot rock slide. after you find your spot, you simply slide down the rock and of a seven foot drop into water. Unfortunately @CAPS wasn't that simple for me, I slid down the rock and of the drop perfectly fine @CAPS little did I know I didn't put my spray skirt on all the way so when I dropped into the water about a gallon or so rushed into my boat. I didn't think much about @CAPS because @CAPS was just a gallon. I actually thought @CAPS was kinda funny and that put a good feeling in my gut because that day I was paddling a big boat for my size so I thought @CAPS would help my weight distribution a little bit. There for I didn't empty out my boat and we just started paddling down stream.  The first few rapids were no big deal I poked through all the holes there were and I felt like I was doing realitavly good because @CAPS had been a while scene I had paddled this stretch. We were about half way through our run when I was starting to realize the magnitude of how gnarly this river was, I was rolling in every rapid I possibly could and laughing my face of every time, @CAPS I couldn't quit, there was no way out of this canyon, we had at least @DATE foot walls on either side of us, the only way out was down stream! We were nearing the end of our trip and we had @CAPS only one more big drop still left to conquer. @CAPS falls, a @NUM foot drop (depends on who you ask) of pure white water. this drop isn't like any ordanry waterfall in fact this drop isn't really anything like a waterfall, sure you definitely will feel the free fall @CAPS the water hydrolics are nothing like a waterfall. What happens on this drop is the canyon gets narrow and when all that water goes over a ledg @CAPS creates a hole at the bottom. @CAPS is also legged out at the bottom so there's tons of water boiling back up stream, so ounce your stuck in that hole @CAPS like trying to paddle up hill and there's basically no way to paddle out of this hole. you just have to hope for the best, hold your breath and stay calm. We were neering @CAPS falls and there's only @NUM eddies you can catch before the falls so you can scout @CAPS. Funny enough when I was trying to make the second @PERSON my boat got bumped out by @PERSON's boat and that little bump ended up flipping me upside down and spinning me backwards, at this point there wasn't much I could do about the next few minutes of my life. So I plunged over the falls, I was mixed up in a huge whitewater mess for about a minute and a half, only having brief moments where I could possibly catch a breath of air. I toughed through @CAPS and didn't pull my spray skirt because i didn't want to drink from the shoe(don't ask) and because of if I ended up ejecting from my boat there's no way to know what would happen to me in this monster. I powered through @CAPS, what was only a short minute seemed like a lifetime to me. I ended up getting flushed out down stream and rolling up perfectly unharmed. when I rolled up, I had the biggest smile on my face and my heart was racing. I don't think I would have made @CAPS if I didn't have a good attitude coming into this day and having the need to laugh in my head when I messed up. All in all laughing saved my life!

12589,21135,8," I have always tried to be a happy person, and over time I have learned that laughter is a key component to my happiness. I have succeeded in being a happy girl most of my life. Even as a baby, I hardly ever cried; I was always laughing and giggling. As I have grown up, I have tried to keep up my happy-go-lucky spirits. Sometimes this was not the case, but that is simply reality. There have been many times in my life where laughter was all that surrounded me. I rely on laughter to keep me close with my friends, and so far, this trust has always came through, and it has worked for me. I often find myself remembering that laughter and happiness is really what life is all about. When I was first born, I didn't cry. I never cried very much as a baby. My mom reminds me of this whenever I ask her about my baby years. As a young kid, I wanted to be a part of everything that surrounded me! I was always looking for laughter and exciting events; I didn't want to miss a beat! My mom would have to take drives just so I could take a nap, and even then, I would hardly ever fell asleep. For if I did, @CAPS forbid, I might miss a moment of laughter! If someone else was laughing, I was laughing with them. Sometimes, I had no idea what was going on, or I wondered why what they had said was so funny, but I loved the feeling laughing with other people. I am always reminded of my happy toddler years whenever I look at my baby pictures. I don't have one of those pictures where I am bawling my eyes out, like you might find in most kid's baby pictures. In every baby picture of me, I'm laughing. If I'm not laughing, then there is a wide smile spread from ear to ear! Laughter is what kept me a happy baby! As a preteen, I was still the girl who you would always see laughing and smiling. I sometimes wondered what it felt like to cry because I had never felt that type of feeling before. I was always so caught up in laughter that I never had time to think about the negative. Now, I unfortunately know the feeling of sadness and being upset, and I try incredibly hard to go back to when I didn't know these feelings. Whenever I'm feeling down, I attempt to find laughter in each thing I do. When I attempt this, I can always find laughter, and my spirits are brought back up. My friends are always a place I can go to for a pick me up. Especially @PERSON, who is my best friend. Every time I am with her, I find myself laughing for one reason or another. @PERSON and I have not had the steadiest friendship, but what always brings us close again is laughter. Our fights always end when we find common ground in something funny. Usually, she is the one who finds this, and she makes me laugh. Laughter is what has kept @LOCATION and I so close for the past few years. If laughter didn't exist, I can assure you that we would be anything but friends right now! Not long ago, I was in the car with three of my closest friends: @LOCATION, @CAPS, and @PERSON. We were all laughing and singing as loud as we could to one of our favorite songs. I looked over to my friends and saw all of their smiling faces, and I found myself smiling too. I realized then, that laughter is truly what life is all about. Laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life. When I was little, I was gravitated towards those who I had the most fun with, and who I laughed with the most. As I've grown older, that same thinking is still there; I want to be with the people that make me laugh. The older I have gotten, the more I've learned about what I need in a friend. My main criteria is someone who can make me laugh. If I'm with someone with a dry sense of humor, and who doesn't talk at all, then I am going to go find someone who is laughable and hilarious!  Laughter is something that I am extremely thankful for. It has been the key to making me happy for all fifteen years of my life! From when I was a baby, up until now, laughter is what always has been, and what always will be, what my life is all about!",17,23,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12590,21136,8," A moment that laughter made everything better was when I was with my cousin @CAPS, in @LOCATION. He is going off to the @CAPS pretty soon, so spending time together was the main goal. @CAPS and I have a a close bond, we talk as much as we can through the phone. This trip meant a lot to both @CAPS and I, we don't know how long it's going to be until we see each other again. Every laughter, and smile was something that we will always remember.  My parents and I went to @LOCATION for @CAPS. In @LOCATION I met up with my cousins, since my parents seemed to be busy all the time. Of course when there is a group of teenagers, well it's going to be loud. I remember- on our @DATE in @LOCATION- my cousins and I got lost in the town we stayed. Now let me say in that town there is no way someone can get lost, it's so small. So when we got lost, we found it so funny and unbelievable that we got lost. Fortunately it was during the @DATE, it wasn't too scary. My cousins and I say it wasn't our fault, we blame the taxi driver for not listening to our directions. Because it was such a funny mess, we didn't stop laughing until we got to our destination. In the car all three of us were argued where to go and what turn to take, while the taxi driver just listened and laughed at us. It was so embarrasing, niether of us wanted to see that taxi driver again. @CAPS is older and way more taller than me, he was the tallest person in town. Now @CAPS is always talking about how he is not afraid of anything and that he is so brave. Until one night all of that was forgotten while @CAPS spent the @TIME. I shared a room with my two other cousins and @CAPS stayed in the room next to ours with my brother. It was about @TIME, when we all went to bed. Out of nowhere we hear a weird noise outside our room. The next thing I hear is @CAPS yelling in the other room, wanting to come sleep with us. I was scared also, so my cousins and I decided to let him come in. I turned on the light while @CAPS and my brother were coming inside the room. My brother @PERSON came in with all the blankets and pillows, while @CAPS came in with the airbed. It was such a funny sight so we all started laughing. @CAPS said "" I @MONTH be big and tall but I get scared easily"", that made us laugh even more. The noise turned out to be two cats fighting in the street. I remember this moment so clearly in my head since it concluded our entire vacation with each other as family. While my parents and grandparents were out in the front lawn with all the guest. My cousins, @PERSON and I were in my room- like always the funny moments happened in my room- we were just bored and didn't know what to do. Slowly I was beginning to fall asleep on top of a suitcase. All of a sudden my cousin @PERSON comes up with this crazy idea of how I can fit in a suitcase. I thought she was kidding, but when I looked up to see everyone's face, I knew they were serious. So here I am opening a suitcase, taking everything out meanwhile @CAPS goes and gets his camera. The next thing I know I'm getting inside the suitcase. I'm no acrobat, nor am I really flexible, so when I notice that I am having no trouble getting inside the suitcase, I freak out. My brother is practically peeing his pants from laughing so hard, my cousins are just baffled at what they were witnessing. When it came to zipping up the suitcase, I told them that was to far, but they convinced me to zip up the zipper so they could roll me around. @CAPS, @PERSON my brother and my third cousin @PERSON all took turns rolling me around. They kept saying on how we should go out in the front lawn and surprise my parents. I came out of the suitcase- I felt so dizzy- after my brother dropped the suitcase on the cement floor. We laughed and made jokes on how tiny I am as well as how much fun it was after I felt a little better. Since then @CAPS calls me ""@CAPS"". Saying goodbye to everyone was hard, but saying goodbye to my cousin @CAPS was even harder. Knowing that I won't see him in a long time is unbearable. @CAPS and I have a strong bond, and I see him like a brother. In our entire trip, neither of us could speak of him going, instead we chose to just have fun and ignore the pain. Laughing made that pain go away. It made our trip worth going.

12591,21137,8," My best friend @PERSON turned thirteen on a beautiful @DATE day. Her family had a boat and, since it the weather was not quite uncomfortably hot but not so cold that it was chilly outside, @PERSON decided to have a sleepover birthday party on the deck with some of her closest freinds. I was nervous about meeting her school-going friends since I'd always been a homeschooler and wasn't going to know any of the other people there. When I arrived at the boat, @PERSON introduced me to her friends @PERSON, @PERSON, and @PERSON. I greeted them all and @PERSON suggested we go @CAPS. I was ready to walk down to the beach but @PERSON said she wanted to go @CAPS right on the docks. @CAPS by the boats wasn't allowed and I was certain @PERSON would say @CAPS immidiately but instead she walked over to the '@CAPS @CAPS' sign, tore it down, and tossed it in the harbor. Her friends laughed and I laughed too. I'd never seen people act this way. But their disregard for rules and customs was contagious. As the day went by I watched the was they talked and behaved. The girls used bad language and spoke harshly. Everything they said was loud and shocking and everything they did was to be wild and challange authority. They acted so free but there was something about their interactions with each other that seemed forced. I wondered if they were truly this way or if they were just pretending. But I understood that to be part of them I had to act like them. It was my first expirience with peer pressure and I didn't know quite what to do. But the girls' attutudes were simple, so I adapted and started to behave like them. But it became clear to me that in order for there to be a group there has to be someone who wasn't in the group. That was @PERSON. @PERSON' parents had made her invite @PERSON and @PERSON and @PERSON knew it. They would sit close together so she didn't quite have room, they would look with disintrest at her without laughing when she tried to make a joke. I became aware that if I hadn't adapeted so quickly to the attitude of the girls, I might have been the one they left out. I also knew that they could still turn on me if I did something wrong. We were sitting on the deck of the boat talking about movies and @PERSON was trying to tell the group about one that she'd just seen and was now her favorite. @PERSON stared blankly at her, refusing to smile. @PERSON looked off into space. @PERSON rolled her eyes to me. Sudenly, @PERSON cut @PERSON off and started talking about a scary movie she'd just seen. @PERSON's eyes widened, then she looked down at the ground. Without thinking, I laughed and reached out to her arm, telling her I wanted to hear more about the movie. I'll never forget the way she lit up at that simple kindness. She smiled and began to gush about how amazing it was with renewed enthusuasm. @PERSON condinuted her story while watching @PERSON and me. @TIME, when we went to the movie theater and the girls chose to sit in a row that only had room for four, I moved to sit with @PERSON in the next row down. We talked about the absurdity of straws for drinks and how we would never, ever wear skinny jeans. It was easy to talk to her. I didn't have to run everything I said through my head to make sure it wouldn't make anyone dislike me. Even @TIME when we were back at the boat, I tried to behave in the same way. I'd never had to focus on being myself before but I knew if I could do it, @PERSON would have someone to talk to. To my surprise, everyone became more natural. Soon we were all joking about what ridiculous things @PERSON should wish for with her birthday wish. I suggested a lifetime supply of marshmellows. @PERSON suggested the original @CAPS of @CAPS. @PERSON suggested to wish that everyone in america would speak with a @CAPS accent on @PERSON' birthday from now on. Everyone laughed. I saw that day that kindness if more powerful than crulty. Making someone an enemy or an outsider doesn't make a friendship stronger. Neither does having to worry about saying or doing something that might make your friends reject you. But integrity and kindness can bring people closer.",19,20,0.0,39,0.0,0.0,0.0,39.0

Laughter can be a great thing, or it can be a little hurtful at times. Luckily my story is of great laughter. So, i will be telling a story of one of my adventures of laughter.  It all started one day when me and my cousin @ORGANIZATION were at home. It was pretty much a normal day. Mom was out and about town, and dad was at work. @ORGANIZATION and I were having a great day because it was a @DATE. Which meant school only went until eleven o' clock. With mom out and about town, we figured she wouldn't be home until much later. That gave us plenty of time to get everything accomplished.  First thing we usually do when mom's gone is go get our music, and turn it up @CAPS loud. Since it was just the two of us home, we didn't care how loud it was. That particular @DATE was a surprise to us though. For it was strange enough to seem as a ""natural high"" day. We felt very positive with high energy. We were practically ready for everything.  With the music so loud while we were cleaning the kitchen, we could barely understand each other talking. Then @CAPS awhile when the music stopped, it was just silent rushed cleaning in the kitchen. @ORGANIZATION and I tend to think a lot alike. It is so weird. Sometimes I feel like she's just my sister instead of my cousin. Anyway, out of no where, and complete silence, we started to sing. I don't think we realized we were singing the same exact song, at the same exact time.  Once we realized that we were doing the same exact thing, it sort of creeped us out! We thought to ourselves... ""@CAPS, how can two people ever be so much alike?!"" @CAPS that happened, we went on finishing our work. '@CAPS this day, all the time, we do a lot of the same things. We are very @CAPS, much like sisters. I'm going to miss her so much when she leaves!",18,15,0.0,33,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.0

12595,21142,8," Laughter between two people is one of the ways you know if you are really good friends. Laughter between each other is what cheers you up if your having a really bad day. It is the reason you know you have a great bond in your relationship. Laughter is the bond between my two best friends and I. It is why we have been friends for so long. One of my best friends is named @PERSON and the other is @PERSON. I have been friends with them for @NUM years now. We are all very close and we do every thing together. We hang out together, we play soccer together, we live close together, and we laugh together. @PERSON loves to go camping with her family in the @DATE. The past @NUM years she has taken @PERSON and I along. @CAPS last trip I had been texting a lot on the trip @CAPS i was the only one who had service at the camp site. @PERSON's mom had yelled at me for texting so much, which had mad me kinda angry. @PERSON and @PERSON had agreed with @PERSON's mom and yelled at me to. I yelled back @CAPS I didn't like how @CAPS were all ganging up on me. I said ""I know, I'm getting off the phone. Just shut up!"" @CAPS were both really surprised that I said that and became intimidated. We all stopped talking and things were really awkward for a little while. Then our friend @PERSON who was also on the trip with us had fallen flat on his face while he was trying to do a cartwheel. @PERSON, @PERSON and I all tried not to laugh @CAPS we were mad at each other, but we couldn't help it, it was just too funny. So we burst out laughing together and realized that we shouldn't be mad at each other. We knew there was no way that a little fight like that was going to stop us from being friends. We all hugged each other and said ""I'm sorry."" @CAPS is why laughter is such a great thing, @CAPS there's nothing better than knowing you have friends that are there for you and can always make you laugh even when your mad at them. It can make your bond between each other stronger and can really repair any damage that has broken a relationship.

12596,21143,8," Laughter is the key to every friendship I have. If a person is really nice, but I cannot seem to make them laugh, or vice versa, it is hard to find common ground between us. When I see my friendships and reflect on them, it reminds me of all of the great memories over the years and months that were filled with joyous laughter. The simple things that make me happy in life bring about laughter. Whenever differences become clear in friendships, it only takes a memory brought up that made us laugh, to trigger that friendship back into place.  Whenever I'm with my best friend, @PERSON, things that normally would not be funny whatsoever, are. Another element that's put in place is the fact that @PERSON and I don't hang out as often as we used to, when we went to the same school @DATE @DATE. So, the absence of eachother makes us treasure our times together even more than usual. Three nights ago, I went to dinner with @PERSON and her mom at @CAPS @CAPS. We had numerous amounts of laughing sessions throughout dinner. Everyone who is ever around us, either think we are very annoying because we cannot stop laughing, or understand what it's like to have a best friend that makes your @DATE brighter, and think we're funny. There has never been a true fight between @PERSON and I because of how close we've become over the @DATE and realized how much we are like twins. So conflicts are never really brought up. However, one of my other very close friends, @PERSON, that goes to my previous school with @PERSON, has been having problems with @PERSON. The most important thing to me is that they get along, because they are two of the most important people in my life. I would do anything to make them become friends like they used to be, even though I probably don't have the power to do so. I can get close into both of their hearts and stay on a level of laughter, secrets and wonderful memories. But when they are not getting along with eachother, it's not so easy to bring them together. I had been with @PERSON @TIME, so I knew what she was feeling as well as @PERSON, who I was with currently. I tried to shortly bring up the subject and at first, she rejected it. I knew that @PERSON meant a lot to her, and also that they had only gotten in a small arguement over something silly. The issue was that both of them can be very stubborn, and in any type of arguement, neither will say they are sorry first. It's because they both don't believe they have done anything wrong. In this case, it was a small miscommunication. I ended up going into more detail with @PERSON about how @PERSON was feeling, because I could completely relate. She later started seeing the other side of things, once I got her laughing. The key to my friendships, is laughter. Especially while we are young. There is no way I could have gotten @PERSON to listen to my view on @PERSON's feelings unless they were what she wanted to hear. So, I told her what she wanted to hear. Things that made her laugh and giggle. Things that brought back memories of the good times her, @PERSON and I had had. She thought about it, and even though she wasn't completely ready to full out run up to @PERSON and hug her over and over, and make peace, she was ready to consider communicating with @PERSON again. That was enough for me to feel good.   The rest of the @TIME, we put aside the drama and laid back and enjoyed the @TIME. We played our favorite songs and were cracking up the entire @TIME about the tiniest things, or mistakes we made in our speech when we talked to eachother. I know that as I get older, I will look back on my two best friends, @PERSON and @PERSON, and realize how they made my high school years so amazing. They brought a better person out of me, someone who can enjoy life to the fullest by being in the right crowd and having innocent fun. They taught me that you can be great friends with more than one person, and even if those two don't get along, you can find a balance and not end up excluding anyone. In the end, the important thing is that you were a good friend to everyone and weren't selfish in the mix. Laughter has brought me to that place. I find that when I'm laughing about sincerely great things, and not making fun of someone or something, I become a lot less selfish and a better friend to people, because my intent is beautiful. I wouldn't get that perspective without true friends that @CAPS has given me. By the @DATE, @PERSON calls me and tells me that @PERSON called her and asked her to talk. Things will change very soon.

12597,21144,8," Close people to you enjoy the moment you have shared with them and remembering it back brings laughter for what had occurred in that moment. Laughter brings people you have known from a long time together because you have had a feeling for that person and for the moment. Laughing at the memories that were spent with that person and enjoying it can make you closer to that person and it can be important to that relationship. In fact, it has happened to me before; laughter came to me when i saw a special video from my past. It was when one of my favorite cousins was two years old and i was three years old at a family party. My cousin was very chubby and with straight hair, but that day she was very sick from fever. I was very different because i had curly hair and was short. We both had a dress on, but the dresses had different styles. Then everyone at the party was having fun and we were, too. The video got to the part when my cousin and i were bouncing up and down grabbing our dress and making a show for everyone at the party. In that time we were suppose to be dancing. It seemed we were having to much fun that day. Afterward, my youngest brother came close to where we were dancing to see us dance, but he was caring with him a cup of soda. Then one of the grown ups gets up from its chair and bumps into him and he drops his cup of soda which splashed my cousin and me. All of our dress were wet, dirty ,and sticky from the soda. We both stopped dancing and sat down on the ground and started to cry. My aunt and my mom changed us to something else, but later when we saw my brother we were so mad that we didn't answer him when he asked us something or wanted to talk to us for that fact. Later on, we were having fun again and talked to him back again. Finally, the video stopped. It's important that laughter gets people closer to someone because together they're having a great moment while laughing. My cousin and i watching the video remembering our memories made us laugh from what happened to both of us. We have shared the same feelings and the innocent we were at that age. We noticed how much we had changed right now from all the funny times we had enjoyed together. We did realize that it was not my brothers fault for splashing us with soda. Laughing from all the moments we shared helped my cousin and me to be more united. Obviously, in different time in life you react in a different way, but laughing in that moment or later on gets people together. Sometimes in time feelings are different, but laughing is important because you're sharing the moment of happiness with someone. I remember events from my past with my family and we get closer to each other and have some laughter for the happy moments.  ",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

But the real thing is that at least someone make you laugh. @CAPS it say it is the important part of any relationship what it is trying to say or make a point of is that you need to laugh in your relationships and, have fun. But my thought about @CAPS is that you clear your mind and you have to listen about things and,then @CAPS it is funny then you start @CAPS about it. Here is what my mom use to says to everyone is that ""@CAPS you have not laughed at all today then you do not have a clear head or body"". There are times in peoples lives where they just laugh and laugh and have a hard time stopping that, i think @CAPS is just a feeling that people have. You @MONTH tell funny jokes that make people laugh but sometimes they do not even make any since at all. You could be out with a bunch of your friends and at a party and you are just standing around and then you start @CAPS because one of them decided that is was to quite and we all needed a laugh. There are sometime you can play a game that is really funny and you have to make funny things or even do crazy stuff, but it all comes down to one thing and one thing only you need a laugh once and, a while. I mean don't everyone need a laugh, I tell my self almost everyday that @CAPS I don't laugh then I did not clear my mind or soul. But is it really about me no it is not. @CAPS you say you need a laugh people look at you like you are crazy but you really aren't.

Cause I am not affected at all I got use to it. @CAPS I heard my first @CAPS joke I had to stop and, think about it for a few mins then after about an hour I realized that they where trying to tell me that it was me. Then I walk up to them and I was like ""@CAPS I finally got that joke and, then I was like what a really good joke. @CAPS you have a laugh for the first time is because that someone special either made you laugh or they tickled you.

12599,21146,8,"    Laughter is one of the many ways to share a memory. It is also a key component to story telling, it shows that the listeners are enjoying what you have to say. When you share a laugh or a smile with someone its almost as if your sharing a deep secret that no one else knows. Laughter is having something in common, it doesn't matter how much money you have or how old you are, a person always has the ability to burst out in laughter. Inside jokes are laughter's best friend, from the second they are made to the slightest mention of them, they always bring smiles and giggles to everyone's face.   As a person, I feel that it is my duty to make people laugh. One example of this would be when I was seven years old and spending the night at my friend @PERSON's house. We had just gotten done watching @CAPS @CAPS and were super hungry for lunch. As it turns out @PERSON's big sister @PERSON was the only one home, and she wasn't going to have anything to do with her ""baby sister"", so we were to fend for ourselves. Being young, we didn't want a boring old @CAPS @CAPS and @CAPS sandwich, we wanted to make @NUM cupcakes! This might sound like a ridiculous objective for two seven year old girls, but we were surprisingly ambitious and tackled this with no problems, or so we thought. In reality it was a disaster, we had no idea what a mixer was so we mixed everything with our hands, which worked up until I brought the flower out. From now on I will never think of flower in the same manner, every time I open the jar of flower all I can think about is the mess @PERSON and I had made that day.   Lets just say it was a disaster, enough flower to successfully make @NUM cupcakes is approximately the whole bag. As I was getting ready to pour this tremendous quantity of flower into the bowl, I slipped on some of the vegetable oil that had spilled out of the measuring cup, and the flower went everywhere! @PERSON started laughing as soon as the white powdery cloud filled the room. As for me, I was still in shock, not to mention covered in what felt like enough batter to feed the entire world. Now that I am a quite a bit older, I don't think I could have taken such a tremendous mess so lightly, considering I would most definitely be the one cleaning it all up. But as a little girl, laughing was the only thing that mattered. @PERSON couldn't stop giggling as she was looking at my whole body covered in white. We started to play in the flower, picking it up and throwing it in the air as if it was confetti. When all of the sudden @PERSON came down the stairs, took one look at the kitchen and started to yell, ""@CAPS and clean this up! I was upstairs for and hour and you manage to make this big of a mess? Mom will be home in twenty minutes and you had better have this kitchen cleaned"" @PERSON and I looked up at each other and back at the kitchen. Then was when it hit me just how much work we had to do. All of the sudden I started laughing uncontrollably, it felt as if I had no care in the world.    It turns out that @PERSON and I completely ignored @PERSON and continued to play in the flower for those short twenty minutes. We were in the middle of building a fort in the kitchen surrounded by what we called ""snow"". I heard the slam of the front door as @PERSON's mom walked into the house. It sounded like paper towels being ripped right from the dispenser. Because we didn't clean up anything, we in fact made the kitchen much worse, we made a split second decision to run down into the basement to pretend we had done nothing wrong at all. That @MONTH had been our biggest mistake, as soon as @ORGANIZATION's mom saw the kitchen we heard a scream, ""@PERSON! What is this??"" . Slowly we climb the stairs to the kitchen and @PERSON starts explaining herself. I choose to stay quiet because I had never gotten in trouble by someone that wasn't my own mom before. When @PERSON is done telling her story, her mom tells us to go downstairs. Both of us are on the verge of crying, when all of the sudden @PERSON starts laughing once again. I could think of nothing that would possibly be funny at this moment when she says, "" you still have flower in your hair"".    From this experience I have learned that sometimes, laughing is the only thing that will make you feel better. Even though I have moved away since this cupcake fiasco, I know that if I ever talk to @PERSON again we will begin laughing at just the mention of this story. ",24,23,0.0,47,0.0,0.0,0.0,47.0

I remember when i was about five years old i loved to draw, it didn't matter what it was as long as i had fun. My grandpa would give me helpful tips on shading, texture, and the over all image itself. One of my favorite things to see was the smile on his face after I figured out how to use his techniques. We would always have a good time together, he was an artist himself who has painted most of the pictures in his house, along with a few at restaurants. I spent most of my childhood in @LOCATION, @LOCATION, @ORGANIZATION, which is where my grandparents lived. I can't remember the last time i was at @CAPS lanes bowling alley, but i can remember my first time. It was with my grandparents, and there was so much for a young kid like me to do there. Another time about @NUM years back, my grandpa went to heat up his coffee in the microwave, and instead of putting his coffee in, he found potatoes. He instantly made hash browns out of them and we had a good laugh. There is a lot i wish i got to do with my grandparents, like go fishing, or even camping. Yet there is a lot i did do with them, my grandpa also painted my boy scouts derby wooden race car. When ever i had a race or competition with boats, cars, or planes, he was the one to paint them. He would come to every race to see how i did, and for some odd reason i got @NUM place most of the time. My grandparents also had a collie dog named @ORGANIZATION, i named him when i was young. He and I grew up like buddies together, and my grandpa @ORGANIZATION and I would always go on walks together. My grandpas favorite thing to do with the dog was train him. He's the most obedient dog I've ever seen, he would go to the mail man and get the mail to bring back, he opened and closed doors if it had a rope, he would even get my grandmas slippers in the bedroom. When i lived in @LOCATION, @ORGANIZATION, everyday after school i would be picked up by my grandparents and go to their house and wait to be picked up by my mom until i was old enough to be alone. Grandma would always help me with math homework and cook dinner and then afterwords grandpa would help me with drawing or turn my favorite @CAPS show on. When i was young i would go over to there house in the morning and grandpa would have recorded my favorite show ""@CAPS the @CAPS"". Every morning that was the routine, and then breakfast. Later on in my life when I became more independent i didn't go over to their house as often as I used to and it is something I cant take back. A few home videos I've looked at recently reminded me of a good time with them, my grandpa was recording me chase the dog around the kitchen table and i stubbed my toe. Apparently it was humorous to my family, all who were laughing in hysterics. Another time when I as younger my grandpa was a barber shop owner and cut hair for years in @LOCATION, @ORGANIZATION, and at his house one time i didn't know what a ""mullet"" was but i knew it was a hair style. I pleaded and pleaded until he finally gave in and gave me a mullet hair cut, i was astonished to what it looked like and immediately hated it. The last @CAPS I spent with my grandpa I bought lot's of presents for him and my family. Thanks to the @DATE job i had on the eastern part of the state, i was able to get a heating blanket that covered his whole bed, a couple movies, and his favorite "" @CAPS"" chocolates. I can honestly say it was the happiest I had saw him in a long time, which made me happy too. When the day is over and you reflect on how everything had gone, you will notice the best of times are only a laugh away.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

They didnt think that they would still be together if they ddnt have any laughter in their relationship. Laughter is the shortest distance between each other because if you dont see this person, but you can sill laugh with this personand have a great relationship with that other person.  Laughter between these two people laughed all the time and they got closer then ever, even though they didnt see eachother all the time, everyday I knew that there relationship wouldnt be alive anymore if they didnt have there laughter, it means that you are happy with that person.  Laughing with somone that you care about also means that you can trust that person and you are being yourself around that person and you dont have to act how you would normally with someone else that you dont trust! I had a boyfriend that i could laugh with all day everyday and thats what kept our relationship together. We laughed instead of talking because that says how we feel towards each other, and we could just tell that we were happy with each other just by laughing. Sittin on the couch staring at each other in the eyes, then we just started to laugh because we thought of something that we had said that made us bust up and just to laugh like crazy even with out saying any words.  Even though we had our fights we would still laugh at eachother and things that made us laugh that one other said. I would be really upset and sad and he would would just know what to say to make me laugh, then i am happy because i know trhat he ares about me and cares if im happy or sad I am. A real relationship is very hard to find with a guy that can make you laugh when your really upset or mad by just smiling or saying somethings that is goofy. Even though he was mad at me he would still try to make me laugh or smile because thats what i relationship is about. If you cant smile or be happy with that person that you ""love"" then you shouldnt be with that person because you know that you wont be happy and you will always be depressed or just plan old mad at that person. Laughter is a key thing and its something that can bring your relationship closer in many ways. If you laugh with that person and you can be yourself that means that if you break up after if it didnt work then that is probably a good sign that you guys will be great friends after. I believe that laughter is something that makes two people closer and then it also is the shortest distance between two people, if you dont wanna talk like me and my boyfriend do we just sit or stand there and laugh because we knew that we could just laugh at eachother and im sure people that we were weird or something, but we didnt even care so we would just laugh and laugh all day everyday all night long. I think that if you arent even in a relationship and you guys or gals are just great friends like me and my friend @CAPS are then you can just laugh at everything that you think is funny and just have a great time, you dont have to be in a relationship with someone to laugh with someone. Laughing is great fort the soal.",16,19,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12602,21149,8," Laughter is important in all relationships of any kind. If you have a friendship where you never laugh and nothing is ever funny, what is the point? I have four friends that mean the world to me. @PERSON, @PERSON, @ORGANIZATION, and @CAPS. @CAPS's real name is @PERSON but we all call her @CAPS because how she acts. @PERSON and I use to do almost everything together. We were inseperable, we went to school together, we even ate our meals talking to eachother. @PERSON and I can make eachother laugh no matter what the situation @MONTH be. I remember when @PERSON and I hadn't been getting along like we usually do. One day at around nine p.m. my phone rings, it was @PERSON I didn't know whether or not to pick up or to just pretend to be busy so the two of us didn't argue. Well I decided to pick up because it was the friendly thing to do and I knew that she would have been there for me. There was obviously a reason she called me, right? As I was about to say hello I could hear @LOCATION crying. I panicked, @PERSON was not one to just cry because of something little. I asked her what was wrong and told her to tell me all about it even though we were fighting I wanted to be there for her no matter what because she was always there for me. The @TIME before it had been @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION, our whole posse or whatever you wanted to call it went together and everything had seemed fine except the usual pointless arguements that always ended in a laugh. Little did we know that the past two weeks @PERSON's @CAPS had been ""house sitting"" he hadn't planned on returning home to his family. As i listen to @PERSON tell me the news and how hurt she was, my heart sank. While she cried I cried. Her @CAPS, broke the news to her @DATE @TIME after we left for @ORGANIZATION. He will not be returning home because he hasn't been happy there for awhile and he wanted a divorce. I knew exactly how @PERSON felt, my parents got divorced when I was very young. Although it didn't tear me apart like it did her it still effected me. Not having a real family with one home and two parents who were married and inlove was never easy on anyone. @PERSON had not the slightest idea that her @CAPS would later get married and start a family with a woman he had been seeing for over a year while coming home to his family. She just kept telling me that she had to bring him home, that she couldn't do this. @PERSON and her @CAPS were really close, she was daddy's girl one hundred percent. I remember her telling me that she just wanted to disappear it was all her fault. All I could do as her friend was listen and tell her it would be okay. @PERSON began to calm down and grasp the fact that things happen and she couldn't change her @CAPS's mind. I invited @PERSON over for the @TIME to just hangout and maybe get thigns off her mind for awhile. It couldn't be easy sitting in her home with her @CAPS gone knowing he wasn't coming back. So @PERSON came over, we played guitar hero and everytime I messed up she would laugh. Hearing @PERSON laugh again made me feel better about things because I knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her @CAPS leaving. Without the laughter in that room I'm not sure me and @PERSON would have been able to ever be good friends again. Afterall laughing at me messing up on guitar hero brought me and her back to being good friends again. So it's very important to have laughter in a relationship because once the laughter is gone then the friendship or whatever you know is going dowhill. Now @PERSON and I talk for endless hours or text about anythign and everything and when we aren't laughing we know to ask one another what is wrong.",16,20,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0

Then she stoud up on her tip-toes (making her taller than me) and said that she was too taller than me and she stuck her toung out at me, so I stoud up on my tip-toes (makimg me taller) and stuck out my toung at her. The funny part is that there was this cute guy standing behind @LOCATION so it looked like I was sticking my toung out at him! He had this amused look on his face like he was looking at some cute little kid. I quickly stuck my toung back in my mouth and returned to my normal hight. I then tolled my mom that @PERSON were going to find a place to sit.

12604,21151,8,"Laughter can create this type of bond that's hard to sever. I can tell you how I've made some fast and true friends just by laughing at the same things. Its an amazing thing when people laugh. It doesn't always make sense or seem that funny at the time but it will make anyone I think feel better no matter what the circumstance. I can tell you how I've made some fast and true friends just by laughing at the somethings. Or how laughter can fix a fight that you and a love one have had. Well here it goes, my story of a very true and very close to home story that help me open my mind and have one of the best and true friends I well ever have in my life. To tell this story i have to go back in time to when i way around nine or so. When I was a young girl my sister, @CAPS, or as I always called her @PERSON, and me hated each other. We never got along, maybe that's because of sharing a room with a older sister, but i can remember her never wanting to play with me or hang out with me. My oldest sister @PERSON had just gone to collage so my sister @PERSON and me got the chance to get to know each other a whole lot more. Sure we still had fights and still didn't get along with each other very well, but we were well on are way to becoming the best friends we are today. Well one day when my parents went out shopping me and my sister @PERSON stayed home to clean the house. Well in my family when cleaning music is blasting no matter what kind it is. As always my big sister had to ""order"" me around, or at least that's what it felt like then, and like always i was a stubborn little sister who never liked taking orders from the big sister. Well @PERSON told me i had to clean the bathrooms, and I hate to clean bathrooms, I mean who does right? So I tell her that wouldn't do clean them...well that doesn't go over so well with the big sister who is charge while mom and dad are away. So we start to fight, and oh what a fight that was. I mean loud as loud can be. The music couldn't even be heard over the yelling and screaming. Like most fighting in my house goes, my sister and I go so feed up with each other that we stormed out of that room and into our own bedrooms. While the music was still blasting and even could be heard from all the way upstairs. So as I ,and I can only guess my sister was doing the same, was plotting my revenge on my oh so ""wise"" sister then music changed to a upbeat classic song that is one of the most popular songs in my house hold. This song was ""@CAPS @CAPS"", because I loved this song so much I opened my door to my bedroom. I guess my sister is like me because she did the same. Well I had started singing and dancing in my room to the music, and guess my sister had heard me because she had come out of her room and into mine. I of course didn't notice her so I had keep doing my singing and dancing. Well as soon as she started to laugh at me I stop and glared at her. @CAPS just stands there laughing, I had said something on the lines as well you couldn't do better then that. So she tried and it was my turn to laugh. We ended up making fun of each others dances and laughed all the way down stairs were we hug and said how sorry and stupid we where for fighting. Then after all that had just happened we look around us at the work to still be done. We then looked at each other and laughed and ran to do our work before mom and dad got home. We finish just in time to, as soon as my mom and dad came home we where just doing the last bit of cleaning. @TIME after my mom and my dad had gone to bed my sister and I had a @TIME of watching movies and laughing our heads off.  That's it, my story of how sisters, or more like best friends can fix and start anything with just laughing and having fun together. Now my sister lives in @LOCATION so i don't see her a lot, but when ever i can i web chat her or call her. We spend hours laughing, it doesn't even matter what we are laughing about. That's what laughter does, it creates this bond, a deep connection.

12605,21153,8," ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I think that laughter is really important in any part, in any kind of relationship. When people laugh, @CAPS get to understand each other better, @CAPS usually people think that you are a cool person when you say something funny, @CAPS laugh with them when @CAPS say funny stuff. It's funner with people who are laughing with you or make you laugh. There were many times throughout my life when many problems were solved by just telling a joke, saying something funny or even remembering fun memories from the past. I have many @CAPS that I love, but of course like in any other friendship, we've had little fights between us.  I remember one time when my @CAPS @CAPS I went to hang out at the mall. Two of my @CAPS came into a huge conflict because of something really weird, which later became an argument. Of course we always had little conflicts, but @CAPS time I guess the two girls were serious @CAPS mad at each other! My other friend @PERSON @CAPS I were looking at them @CAPS didn't know what to do. @CAPS my friend @PERSON was kind of scared that @CAPS might hurt each other. I told them,"" @CAPS you guys! Don't be like that!"" @CAPS looked at me @CAPS stopped. So we started to walk. @CAPS I remembered something funny @CAPS crazy that those two girls @CAPS us did, at a camp the week before @CAPS happened, @CAPS after that camp I remember how @CAPS were saying how we are going to be ""@CAPS @CAPS For @CAPS"" for our whole life's @CAPS that @CAPS wouldn't forget how much fun we had. I started to laugh remembering what we did that camp, @CAPS @CAPS looked at me like I'm weird or something. So I reminded them about all that fun stuff we did, @CAPS @CAPS looked at each other @CAPS started to laugh really hard! Because their conflict had something little to do with that camp, what @CAPS've had forgotten!  After that @CAPS started to talk to each other @CAPS forgot about that conflict that @CAPS had. Sometimes I remind them about the conflict, but @CAPS just laugh @CAPS say ""We were so dumb, to make that conflict!"" @CAPS we all laugh at them.""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS is why I think that laughter is really imported in any friendship. @CAPS I think that @CAPS problem was solved by just saying some funny memories so @CAPS can laugh! @CAPS reminding someone a thing that @CAPS had forgotten.",17,16,0.0,33,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.0
12606,21154,8,"Laughter is a key importance in life, family, and relationships. Gets people through tough times and times when you just need a friend. Laughing is a big part in my life, joking around and having fun, when something happens I try to cover it up with laughter. People @MONTH say that laughing is to much in situations, but it gets a lot a people trough tough times. @CAPS there was no laughter in the world in would be dull and I feel that people would be without really experience laughing and making jokes.    Making other people laugh gives me good feeling even @CAPS it is a lame joke. I think that because it gives me a good feeling about my self, one good thing I know how to do. My family has always been the joking type, messing around and just laughing about everything. There has been a lot of good memories with my family and I, jokes and what not. We enjoy every little laughing matter because its something we each treasure and its a bond that we do not want to loose.One moment in my life where laughter was really great for was in awkward situations with people. My sports team, getting down on ourselves very fast during games and we start to blame other people which is the most common thing that people do when they start to stress in situation like this. Causing so many errors my team mates and I are just not paying to one another and not acting like a team. Just after losing so many games you really start to lose hope for yourself and your team. Our coach always try's to comfort us by saying we did good or we could have tried harder. Some people take this seriously or people do not care and act nothing ever happened and those people start to shut @CAPS out and only care for their good friend on the team. One morning before we even started things were tense between people. The captain noticed that two of the team members where talking about her and she confronted them saying ""@CAPS your going to talk about me behind my back just say it to me."" @CAPS was in complete shock no one knew what to say, so i stated ""well this is just awkward."" The whole team just started to laugh because it loosened @CAPS, even though it didn't totally solve things it just made the situation a little better.Another moment in my life where laughter was a key part was during road trips. Being suck in the car with my family going somewhere and on the way back from were ever we came back it is a lot of bonding time. You start to talk crazy not making an sense, not being like yourself. Then it bring out the fun of messing around then saying something or do something were it become really funny and its a moment that you don't want lost. An example that happened to me on this experience was going to @LOCATION and making up a lot of inside jokes of things we saw or heard. moments like these I always want to treasure because these people in your life right now will not always be their. To create memories do the basic thing and laugh with family. Laugh with your friends.I believe that in some of these situations it could help loosen some of the tension between people, and sometimes make things a little less weird between people. Just being yourself and dont change that. Having so many of these types of moments and much more are special to me, no matter good or bad. they help me remember things easier. Just having the little moments like these are special and it reminds me of how much I really did care about this one person or realize that a moment wasn't a total lost, because it had the thoughts of people laughing and its something that comforts me.

Then there's my @DATE @CAPS.The sunshine came in bright throughout the window illuminating the whole room, I awoke to see the bright light of the sun. I ran into my brother @PERSON's room, to make sure he was up and ready to start the day with me. He clearly was; the early riser himself. We left his room and started to smell the sweet aroma of chocolate chip cookies, we booked it down the hall into the kitchen to talk to mom about what we were going to do that day. When we got there mom turned around to show us her gigantic belly, which was holding my soon to be baby brother, we asked her what we were doing that day. Disappointed at her answer she had nothing planned. My brother and I were bummed but we quickly got dressed and went to the backyard where we were pitching together, the ball hit softly on my nice leather glove while on my brothers it made a slap. My mom came outside and yelled to @PERSON to go over to the sliding glass door, for a second I thought I was in trouble for pitching too hard to @PERSON but luckily that wasn't the case. My mom then called me over as well to let me know my cousin was coming over. My first thought was great @ORGANIZATION's coming over! Then I started to think, my cousin @ORGANIZATION is weird... she is always making up lies, telling non funny jokes, playing with @PERSON @CAPS cards, and playing weird stupid video games. I quickly ask my mom when she is coming so I can ready myself, for whatever I am going to have to put up with my mom tells me fifteen minutes. I quickly run past her into my room where my phone is, and call my neighbors @DATE and @ORGANIZATION to see if I could hang out. Their mom answers and says I can come over there as soon as the girls chores are done, excited I tell my mom I will be at the neighbors house for a little while and @PERSON would have to hang with @ORGANIZATION while I'm gone. Shes tells me that its alright as long as I leave before @ORGANIZATION gets here. I await the phone call telling me that I can go over to their house. Noon is rolling around and they still haven't called, @ORGANIZATION will be here soon and I am tired of waiting. I decide to go out front where I can roller-blade around the block, I tell @PERSON that I am going outside and he tags alone with me. @PERSON and I put on our roller blades and head out of the garage, my mom comes out right as we are about to leave and tells us @ORGANIZATION called and we can go over there now, we rush in and quickly try to step up the stairs in the garage to the house. Slipping as we try to shove each other out of the way with the roller blades on, I finally get inside and start unhooking the latches. Get them off and head for the door when all of the sudden I hear a knock just as I reach for the door, it's @ORGANIZATION. I hurry out the the door saying hello to my cousin as I quickly escape to the neighbors house. I get to @ORGANIZATION's house and we decide to go outside to play, and run with her new puppy. We play for a little while then decide we should go inside and get a snack we do, then the doorbell rings. @ORGANIZATION runs to the door with the puppy at her heels and lets the people in, I turn around from the table to see who it is and see @ORGANIZATION and @PERSON standing inside the door. They came over to play too, I let @DATE know we should watch a movie. She went over to the movie cabinet and pulled out the brand new @CAPS movie!  We all sit down and start to watch the movie each with a bowl of popcorn. We watched almost all of it when the doorbell rang, the puppy bolted to the door and @DATE got up to answer it this time my mom stepped inside and told @ORGANIZATION, @PERSON and I that it was time to leave. The puppy was ecstatic to see my mother so she peed all over the linoleum floor. @ORGANIZATION didn't notice the dog pee on the floor, so she ran for the door to get her shoes on and she went flying backwards into the dog pee everyone was laughing even @ORGANIZATION. We said our thank you's and headed back to my house to eat dinner and get @ORGANIZATION ready to leave.

12608,21156,8," It was a cloudy @DATE, but nothing to be sad about when among friends. This circle of friends had just spent the whole weekend together, and they were heading home. I was among this group as a young @CAPS who had known this group for three years. Three years before, I was shy, but something changed that. The group was called @ORGANIZATION. This @ORGANIZATION was for teenagers and even some collage students. There were very few of us though. It was our last year as @ORGANIZATION, then we would be kicked out of the church we were meeting at. Together, we made that weekend be are best and last @ORGANIZATION. The boys were very comfortable around the girls, so much in fact, that they were going to make a deal with us. The deal was that during the car ride, if we rubbed their backs, then they would rub our feet. At @CAPS the girls thought this to be a crazy idea, but as time went on, that foot rub seemed really good. Three pairs were made, with a boy and a @CAPS in each. The boys sat in the second to last row in the car, and the girls sat in the back. I rubbed @PERSON's back, but it's okay. Out of all the girls there besides his sister, I know @PERSON the best, so I was perfect for the job. This moment was a very giggly time for the girls, and a very relaxed time for the boys. While the boys were falling asleep, the girls were laughing hysterically. Since we had our feet right beside the boys for them to rub, then the easiest way to wake them up was to kick them. This just caused more laughter, and more alert boys.  After we had enough with the foot and back rubs, then we needed to find something new to laugh about to make the time pass faster. It was the @DATE before @DATE, so our @ORGANIZATION leader gave us each a bag of candy hearts. The little messages on those candy hearts could entertain us for about an hour and a half. We would pick one randomly out of the bag and hand it to someone. I ended up giving both @PERSON and @PERSON candy hearts that said, ""@CAPS"". They were very confused, but again it caused more laughter. @PERSON accidentally gave one to @PERSON that said, ""@CAPS @CAPS"". Andrew got hearts multiple times that said, ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS"".  Once that was beginning to become boring, then we found a new way to make the candy hearts entertaining. We would read the heart @CAPS, then give it to someone saying it was from someone else. Kyrene gave one to @PERSON saying it was from @PERSON that said, ""@CAPS @NUM @CAPS"". Whenever we had one that said, ""@CAPS"", then we would give it to @PERSON saying it was from @LOCATION. Earlier she had said to him, ""I thought you were @CAPS for a moment there"", but numerous people thought she said, ""I thought you were @CAPS for a moment there."" @CAPS, we try to make it up to @PERSON for @PERSON by giving him ""@CAPS"" candy hearts.  We ended that @DATE with hugs, goodbyes, and laughter of retold inside jokes. A few phone numbers were exchanged, and a few that should have been weren't. The trip ended well, and everyone felt just a little bit closer. We could hug this person @CAPS, or we could get this person's phone number. Something in us changed that we could be a little closer.  In my experience, I would say that laughter is only one element, because to get laughter you need to love who your laughing with. If I didn't love the people I was in the car with then I would have not laughed with them. They say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I don't believe this is true. I think it's love that is the shortest distance and laughter is just love being shown. The statement that laughter is the shortest distance is assuming that laughter is the cause, but in truth, it is the effect. Love is the cause of laughter. If laughter was the cause of love, then this world would be doomed to never know either. Without love, there can be no laughter. ",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

This has happened to myself many times, but the one time I remember most, was @CAPS I began making strange noises. I normally make sound @CAPS and such @CAPS I'm bored and want to start a conversation, but I had never laughed and made sounds like that before. That moment changed the way I laugh today. The date was @DATE, it was my birthday, so I decided to have my party at @ORGANIZATION. I invited my two best friends, @PERSON and @PERSON, to tag along. We love to laugh and just have fun. So, inviting them was a no-brainer.  Immediately, we decided that our favorite water slide in the park was the grand and slightly over sized @ORGANIZATION' @CAPS. It was a large funnel with flashing red and @CAPS lights inside. We went on it over, and over, and over again. The adrenaline was pumping through our veins as the ride would end and we'd leaped from the inter tube and rush to the stairs where the waiting line was held. We talked, chatted, sang, yelled, and most likely annoyed every other person in line. Then, @CAPS we finally got to the top of the stairs, we became in awe of the lifeguard. But, not because he was gorgeous. He looked as if he was a wee little leprechaun! We stifled a small laugh and got on the ride. @PERSON asked him to turn the inter tube around so that she could go down the ride backwards. He then began to talk, and we couldn't help but smirk. He began flirting with us by saying in his manly voice, ""@CAPS want me to ride down with @CAPS ladies?"" @CAPS he said that, @PERSON was the first to break. Then me. Then @PERSON. We couldn't hold it in anymore. He then awkwardly cackled and pushed the inter tube down the slide. We were laughing so hard that we weren't even paying attention to the ride. Then it hit me.  ""That dude looks like @PERSON @PERSON!!"" I screamed to @PERSON. @CAPS the ride ended, we thought for a second. Then undoubtedly went again. Truth be told, he @CAPS look like @PERSON. We began laughing again throughout the ride, up until I made a strangely abnormal sound. I made a noise that sounded as if a pig had just had it's tail yanked. It was almost a shriek, but more of a squeal. @CAPS just happened? @CAPS I seriously just...just...@CAPS?! Note: A best friend will always be there for @CAPS, especially @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS something embarrassing. It's their job to poke fun at one's strangeness.   So of course, @PERSON was the first to say, ""@CAPS the heck was that?""  @CAPS followed by @PERSON's expression of, ""@CAPS @CAPS just @CAPS?"" That's @CAPS we began to laugh and then I started making even more unusual noises. I started squealing, snorting, and hiccuping. We were still laughing at my crazy squel @CAPS we got off the inter tube.  Later after we had our fill of the @ORGANIZATION' @CAPS, @PERSON decided we should go in the wave pool. Of course, @PERSON and I agreed. The speaker system in the area started blaring the song ""@CAPS"" by @PERSON. @PERSON is my go-to-gal @CAPS it comes to breaking out in song. She began singing, then we all joined in. But @CAPS it got to the chorus, ""I throw my hands up in the air sometimes..."" we all said, ""I throw my banana in the air sometimes...""  ""@CAPS my @CAPS, we should totally make a song of our own."" @PERSON said.  We began thinking of different lyrics we could say in our song. At first, we knew exactly @CAPS to say to fill in the chorus, then we decided that the song needed more lyrics. That was harder to think up. But, then we decided that we should make the song about food and the way we eat it. We had so much fun. Eventually, we came up with the entire song and people were staring at us as we screamed it to the world. Then, the terible noise arrived again. @PERSON began to laugh, then @PERSON and I joined in harmony, then a rude interruption by my @CAPS. @PERSON and @PERSON continued to laugh at my sound @CAPS. I joined in with them, laughing at myself.  That night we went to bed, humming the tune of our new song, ""@CAPS @CAPS"" out loud. Now, whenever we hang out, we begin to sing our song, and sometimes, even dance! People still look at us strange, but then we just start laughing, and I start making sound @CAPS.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

Two things that made my @CAPS more than I ever thought @CAPS could be; @CAPS and one girl. I realized over just one @DATE that there is more to @CAPS than what we see or hear. Emotions that you can't describe. Something that you have to live out for yourself. Looking back on three months of @CAPS changing events, I laugh at how fast my @CAPS turned and started heading the right way. Also how one girl can bring me to church and how @CAPS can keep a relationship moving strongly. We're part of a movement that will last forever. Her and I moving on the perfect path to eternity with eachother. Have you ever had a person in your @CAPS that made you so overwelmingly happy that @CAPS caused you to change your @CAPS plan forever? I have found some things on this earth that explain my whole purpose on earth. The first time I ever saw this girl. @CAPS was like a instant shock through my body. @CAPS felt like I needed her, like something was whispering in my ear,""go get her."" One day talking to my friend about this girl I couldn't get out of my head. I told him how I was going to talk to her @DATE and there was nothing that was going to stop me.  @CAPS said,""I have a class with her.""  @CAPS thought about her and I together; like in a relationship. In a intense thought @CAPS looked up at me and said,""actually I think you guys would be perfect together."" @CAPS that @CAPS said that I said, ""sweet."" I talked to her that day. She was better than I expected. I needed back up though. I had a different friend come with me to talk to her and her friends. I saw her in the hall. So we started to walk over. We got to them and my friend just kept walking. Thinking in my head, ""what a great friend."" @CAPS was me alone with seven other girls. Trying to look the best I could look. What @CAPS me is I actually pulled @CAPS off. She actually thought i was attractive. Was @CAPS love at first sight? I don't know you tell me. Getting close to @DATE. I got my license. Looking forward to what my @DATE was going to look like. All was looking really good. Until i found a job at a ice cream factory. Waking up at four in the @TIME wasn't the best way to start out my @DATE. I still wanted to impress her and be with her all @DATE. I met a guy named @PERSON. @CAPS asked if I wanted to study the bible with him. I knew that @PERSON went to the same church. So i wanted to do @CAPS.  About two months @DATE they went to a church thing over in @LOCATION. @PERSON was baptized there. Then @DATE; after they got back. I was baptized. We both had @CAPS with us. Love was building up between us. What better to do than date? We started dating on @DATE. Wonderful moments that I will never forget. That look she gave me like fire burning in her eye's with love. Going to the beach, driving around, fair rides, picking her up and never letting go.  Still with love burning inside of us. I went to her house. Lost track of time and noticed I was going to be late getting home. @CAPS was a rainy night. Saying good bye to her parents and giving her a big hug. I ran out the door, got in my truck, and took off. Couldn't see well. A corner popped out of no where. Started slidding across the road. A tree was moving toward me. I hit the tree. In mid flight. Time slowed way down. I thought is this @CAPS. One picture popped into my head. @CAPS was her face. I landed with a big screaming sound. I got out as fast as possible. I came out with cuts and bruises but that was @CAPS.  I thank @CAPS that I survied my crash. I am so lucky I didn't die. main oint is. I think I was put on this earth to be with her and thats what I'm sticking to. @CAPS's times like these that make you realize how amazing @CAPS is. Laughing at @CAPS now. How laughter can change your @CAPS around. I finally said I love you girl. We are together to this day.",15,20,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12611,21159,8," My cousin @PERSON and her boyfriend, @PERSON, had been dating for three years and they had planned a special date for their anniversary. They made reservations at the @ORGANIZATION in @LOCATION and then take a walk on the beach after-wards. For @PERSON this was a small step up from an ordinary date but for @PERSON this was the biggest day of his life. This late @DATE evening was the day he would ask @PERSON to be his wife! @PERSON pulled up to @PERSON's house at precisely five-o'clock pm. In his hands he held a bouquet of roses which were handed to the most beautiful girl on the @ORGANIZATION. She was dressed in a white and pink dress with matching pink heels and her hair was all done up fancy. @PERSON was speechless as he handed her the bouquet. After the roses were placed in some water, he escorted her down the steps to his car, @CAPS number one. @PERSON couldn't start his car. In utter embarrassment @PERSON asked @PERSON to drive her car to dinner. She giggled and assured him that she didn't mind. When they arrived at @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION they were sad to find that their reservation had been double booked and the other couple had arrived only moments before them. In despair, they set off in search of something else. Everything else that @DATE @TIME seemed to be full so @PERSON decided on @CAPS's, her favorite restaurant. After a good forty-five minutes of waiting to be seated they were lucky enough to get a window seat. @PERSON ordered a burger and fries because he is not a seafood fan. In contrary, @PERSON loves seafood so she had a bowl of @CAPS's world famous clam chowder. When dinner was finished @PERSON excused himself to use the restroom before they left but as he was getting up, he knocked over his @ORGANIZATION and it spilled all over @PERSON's new dress, creating a brown, sticky mess. @PERSON cleaned up the best she could but there was almost no use. So far so bad, but the worst was still yet to come. When they came to pay the bill @PERSON began panicking. He realized that he had left his wallet in his car! @PERSON's face turned bright red as he watched his girlfriend pay the bill. Good thing we didn't go to the @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION! he thought. @PERSON was ready to go home but @PERSON was determined to propose to her so he begged her to walk on the beach and watch the sun set. She agreed. With @CAPS step, @PERSON's heart began to beat faster, his throat dry, his hands sweat, and his body shake. They sat on the warm sand and talked for ten minutes. Finally @PERSON was really ready to go so this was his last chance. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the lone ring. As he got on one knee, the ring fell into the sand. It was getting dark so after a minute or two of frantic searching, he gave up and began to cry. @PERSON was so confused and thought he was crying because she wanted to leave but as soon as @PERSON calmed himself he told his story and how this was supposed to be the perfect proposal for the perfect girl but it turned out the be the worst @TIME of his life. @PERSON just laughed which made @PERSON think she was mocking him but he continued anyway. ""@PERSON, will you be my wife?"" @CAPS tears of joy she said, ""@CAPS! As long as @CAPS day can be an adventure like tonight."" @CAPS time they mention this story they bust out laughing even though it wasn't funny at the time. Ever since then they have had many hilarious and embarrassing stories that they can laugh at now.",21,25,0.0,46,0.0,0.0,0.0,46.0

As soon as we we walked the three mile walk to get to @PERSON's house @LOCATION realizes that he forgot his phone charger at my house. We didn't want to walk all the way back to my house and we had no ride either because none of us have our license yet and and @PERSON's parents aren't home. So @PERSON and i start brainstorm on how to get back to my house to retrieve @LOCATION's cell phone charger, when suddenly...We heard a loud bang come from the backyard from the old rugged y shed in the back dark corner of the yard; @LOCATION and I go to check it out to see what the noise was. we open the shed and one of @PERSON's dirt bikes had fallen over. @PERSON and I pull the dirt bike out of the old spider-web infested shed. @PERSON and i both got a light-bulb above our heads and suddenly looked up at each other with the same idea. not being so smart we figure @LOCATION can just ride the dirt bike the three mils back to my house on main roads and he will be fine. @PERSON tells @PERSON about are idea and @PERSON says its a bad idea because he mom is not home and he doesn't want us getting in trouble for a phone charger. @PERSON repeatedly tells us to put the dirt bikes back, but next thing you know @LOCATION has the bike out front testing it out around the neighbor hood. I tell @LOCATION ""since there is only one dirt bike you take it and ill follow on the @CAPS bike!"" next thing you know me and @PERSON are side by side riding a dirt bike and a @CAPS bike down the busiest road in town and its pitch black outside. ""@PERSON you go and ill meet you there!"" i yell. @PERSON takes off down the road at about @NUM mph and im about @NUM yards behind him. suddenly I see a white figure start to creep out from a driveway, i cant quite make out what it is... When suddenly i see flashing red and blue lights! i try to warn @LOCATION and shout ""@PERSON @NUM!!!"" yet he is to far away to hear me but since its pitch black outside the lights light up the whole street, @LOCATION tries to loose him by going down a side road but its no match for a charger cop car. It's out of my hands now so I bike back to jeremys house and get him and we run the the scene of the crime to see whats happening. we keep are distance and act like we don't know him. the cop has @PERSON in cuffs standing behind the cop car and the cop goes back to his car to write @PERSON a ticket and I see @LOCATION shadows under the street light throw something into the bush's.. Since it wasn't his dirt bike and he couldn't ride it him the cop calls a tow truck and has him take the bike and the cop gives @LOCATION a ride home with @MONEY in tickets.. As soon as they leave the scene I go check to see what @LOCATION threw in the bush's and it was a can of chew because he is a minor.. so i grab it. the next day @LOCATION is home and his parents are at work so I bring him his chew, and he starts to tel us what his mom punished him with when suddenly we heard the garage door start to open; his mom was home from work so i hand him his chew and I run out the backyard and over the fence. he tells me to not tell to many people because he doesn't want everyone knowing but its already the talk of the town...",16,18,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12613,21161,8," It was a day like any other. I was going to chess club to challenge the board one holder. I had never piercingly met him for I was new to the club, but I knew that if I didn't play @CAPS best I would lose. I entered the room hoping to see that the holder was not there, @CAPS was. @CAPS had on a blue baseball cap, a blue t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and a pair of black shoes. His hair was as dark as his shoes and looked as if @CAPS had not brushed it in years, his skin was very pale I wondered how @CAPS could go out in sun with out some way to block it. The board was set up and ready, @CAPS was the clock. the clock had an hour on each side. I walked up to him, @CAPS didn't even seem to notice me until I spoke, ""@CAPS @CAPS guna beat me fast. I know I'm guna lose."" @CAPS just sat there, staring at me like I had insulted him. ""@CAPS,"" @CAPS scoffed, ""your the kid they think can beat me."" ""I guess. I never really thought about it."" I was unsure as to why that would mater, but I was playing him, @CAPS I was absolutely sure that it was or was going to mater very soon. ""@CAPS please take @CAPS seat @CAPS we can begin the matches!"" the coach called out, ""@CAPS, we all know the rules, the black player @MONTH start the white @CAPS clocks. No talking."" ""@CAPS."" I said, ""your name is what."" ""@CAPS name is @CAPS."" I hit the clock. Expecting him to be like lightning and move, I moved @CAPS piece. Bad move. @CAPS called and pointed out that I had moved a piece when it was not @CAPS turn. The coach came up to the clock and pressed some buttons, @CAPS didn't even look like @CAPS cared about the game and if a board ten holder could beat a board one holder. When @CAPS set the clock down the clock showed fifty to fifty five. I was already down on time and the game hadn't even really began.  @CAPS picked up the kings bishops pawn and moved it up one square. @CAPS hit the clock like lightning. That was wired @CAPS moved the weakest piece on the board. I had to stop and think for a vary long time or what felt like it. I looked over at the clock to see how I was doing on time. It was terrible I had been sitting there for about ten minutes and I hadn't even moved one lousy piece. @CAPS I picked up @CAPS king's pawn and moved up two squares hopping @CAPS wouldn't do anything that could hurt @CAPS in @CAPS game. I hit @CAPS clock.  We sat there for what must have been half an hour. @CAPS I got up and went to the bathroom. When I came back I checked on how the other @CAPS were doing. Only one game was done it was @PERSON and a kid I didn't know. I asked who won, it was the kid I didn't know as odd as that was I had to get back to @CAPS game.   @CAPS still hadn't moved, for a minute I thought @CAPS was having a problem breathing. @CAPS let out a yawn and moved his king's knight's pawn up two squares and hit the clock. That was weird, @CAPS just did fools @CAPS. I didn't think for a minute, I piked up @CAPS queen and brought it all the way to one square in front of his rook pawn. I said ""@CAPS @CAPS."" in a loud voice.  @CAPS started to laugh, at first I was confused for I beat him.Then @CAPS said,""I do @CAPS with every one I play for the first time, @CAPS opening.""@CAPS started to laugh again, @CAPS time I joined him we both were laughing because I beat him. Then @CAPS said, ""@CAPS are the first one to see that they could win in the first two."" That surprised me I thought that @CAPS won all the time when really @CAPS had been giving people games and the didn't know it. We started to laugh again, the coach came over and saw that I won @CAPS said good job and walked away. @CAPS said, ""@CAPS is the start of a new beginning I can quit board one now for there is someone who can beat me."" @CAPS walked up to the coach and must have told him that @CAPS wanted me on board one for now I'm on board one and @CAPS new friend, @CAPS is there with me on board two.

12614,21163,8," ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Many people say that laughter is the key to life. If you can't laugh, then you are not a fun person to be around. Many other people believe that laughter is a very important part of relationships that they are having. In my opinion, I think that laughter is very important also. It lightens the mood in awkward situations, and laughter also just makes you and other people happy. And I personally, would rather be around a happy person, than one that isn't. A few days ago, my mom, sister and I decided to go to the bowling alley in @LOCATION. We were all three invited to go, along with about @NUM other women from the @ORGANIZATION we attend. We attend the @ORGANIZATION. We had all made reservations at @CAPS @CAPS at @NUM @CAPS.  We arrived first and sat there and waited for about @NUM minutes. Then finally we seen some of our friends walking in. We ran over there to greet them and to show them where we were sitting. Our friends started getting their bowling shoes from the counter and then they ventured over towards us. Once all our friends got there, we began to bowl. We had a total of three @CAPS for everyone. My mom, sister and I were all three at one lane, and with us was two other friends. The first game we bowled a normal game. As usual, everyone was getting strikes except for me. I was getting pretty discouraged. So our second game around and we all decided to change the rules up a little bit. This round we could not bowl like we normally do. Each time it is our turn we have come up with a new way and new position of sending the ball down the lane. After awhile everyone was running out of things to try so people started laying and sitting on bowling balls and then sending a different ball down the lane. That was really hard.  Towards the end of the second game, everyone was tired. Their arms hurt and so did their fingers. My last frame I got up and picked the ball I wanted to use. I waited for the people in the @CAPS next to me to get done with their turn and then I went up to bowl. I got ready, and brought my arm back before I flung the ball down the lane. Just as I did that, my fingers let go of the ball and I dropped it. The whole side of the bowling alley I was on just busted up laughing. I was so embarrassed. My face was beet red. It was horrible. Then on my next turn I brought ball back, and then brought it forward and I literally threw it into the other lane. I fell to the floor laughing my head off. It was so funny. That night by far, was the best night I have had in quite a long while. ",20,19,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12615,21164,8,"The @CAPS We @CAPS in @CAPS  Laughter is a usual @CAPS used in many different ways, to release tension, to appreciate a funny joke, or maybe just to express a giggly mood. I find that laughter is the key to having a close relationship with people. It could be because each persons laugh is personal and every time someone laughs they aren't thinking about how they look or what they should say next to fill the awkward silence, their guard is completely down for just an instant. Growing up with my father has proven this fact to me by having our relationship based off of laughing our problems, or difficulties with one another, away. Although I @CAPS a good relationship with my @CAPS the relationship with my @CAPS has always been a silent and guarded one because we @CAPS been unsuccessful in bringing humor to the relationship. Which proves to me the point that laughter and humor are two very important things in creating a bond between two people.  Ever since I was a young girl my father and I @CAPS always been very close and I @CAPS begun to realize that whenever I speak of him to an adult or anyone really, they will know him. Everyone always seems to know my @CAPS. It might be because of his humor, or maybe because older women find him attractive, or maybe because he's nice, either way he's been popular his whole life. Also, ever since I've known my @CAPS he has never been much of a serious type of guy, he will make some sort of humorous comment or joke no matter the circumstance. It doesn't matter if I'm sad, or enraged under the spell of my adolescence and hormones, my mood will completely change and because of this it has shown me the power of laughter. The relationship between my @CAPS and I, however, has always been a rocky one, for several reasons I'm sure but one of them I believe is we were never capable of laughing together, or enjoying ourselves. See, she comes from @LOCATION, @LOCATION and in @LOCATION things are done a bit differently. Laughing or fooling around for instance is considered being disrespectful or immature, everyone is to act properly and children are to respect their elders. So when my @CAPS married her, I introduced her to sarcasm and jokes. I never got the reaction I was looking for, and since there was never that connection through laughs and humor I felt guarded around her. I @CAPS never been able to feel like I can express myself around her. I constantly feel judged and awkward and this has allowed me to see the effects of absence of laughter.  A human beings laughter is emotional and personal, like crying, it immediately allows you to feel happy, sort of like a drug. Once you get someone to laugh you are allowing them to open up to you in a small way, and not only are they opening up to you, but by the good reaction you received you begin to create a connection with them. If there is no laughter in a relationship with two people it tends to get awkward and neither person can feel comfortable opening up to each other. Since I am my @CAPS daughter, I tend to apply jokes in the same way he does. When there's tension, when someone's upset and I want to immediately solve the problem, I make them laugh.  Someone once said that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", how I interpret this quote is that laughter is the one @CAPS everyone enjoys doing, it can either build or keep relationships going. It's the one @CAPS we will always @CAPS in @CAPS. So c'mon guys laugh a little.",20,25,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0

12617,21167,8," Recently over the @DATE of @DATE I was fortunate enough to meet my uncle whom I have never consciously met. This to me was a major part of learning about my family because I met up with not only my uncle , but my legitimate comedian aunt who I have known since I could remember ,and my father at a local @CAPS restaurant called @ORGANIZATION. These three were all siblings, and this allowed me to peer into what siblings will joke about , talk about , and bring forth a feeling of nostalgia for each other. I myself have a stepsister, but the degree of nonsense being presented before me was of a much greater magnitude than I could ever fathom. Everyone was constantly in a state of laughter from the stories of the shenanigans that my father and his brother and @CAPS managed to get into. At one point I started having a very hard time breathing.The stories and all-together bad jokes being distributed made me understand that in my family there have been a long line of relatives who inherited some gene that forces us to tell bad jokes. Not even inappropriate but plain stupid jokes. I realized that my children will be telling bad jokes. We dined there for a couple of hours before my dad had to leave for his home up in @LOCATION, and I needed to be taken home to my family here in @LOCATION. But tomorrow was planned for a day of exploration of @ORGANIZATION and plenty of stupid jokes to be exchanged. I woke up the next day got dressed and prepared myself for laughter I was aware I would be keeling over because of. When I met with uncle and my aunt as well as my uncle's girlfriend we set off towards the fish hatchery on what I believe was the @LOCATION. All the jokes started slow because everyone was tired and still waking for the rest of the day's trip. We arrived at the hatchery and we began by feeding some fish they have out in a pond.We watched the fish as they swam around in their concrete canals for at least twenty minutes. We then progressed through the hatchery and soon returned to the car and made our trip to @ORGANIZATION. Once we had parked outside the @ORGANIZATION we could hear the beautiful sound of rushing, so beautiful I really needed to pee. We walked along the paths and eventually climbed up a an outlined path to get a get closer view of the @ORGANIZATION and we were enthralled. I was being tortured by the thought of using the restroom. I was able to hold it, but it shortened our visit to the @ORGANIZATION which was an inconvenience to everyone else but they obliged. I will remember the @ORGANIZATION for it's pure natural beauty. After visiting the @ORGANIZATION we were going to the very tourist friendly town of @CAPS's @ORGANIZATION. We drove by and I nearly lost my mind when I saw the alpacas. Before we did anything at @CAPS's I first found a restroom and we were later all in agreement that we should get something to eat. A @CAPS themed restaurant was an obvious choice and we decided to satisfy our hunger at this fine establishment. They seated us and our host was a very nice young woman. we scanned the menu for something that sounded appetizing. I had found this restaurant was a winner of tastiest burger awards. Falling into temptation I had to order one of these burgers. I do not regret doing this because it was one of the best burgers I have ever had the delight of eating. After satisfying the hunger plaguing us , our group began to browse the gift-shops and the silly novelties that they carried. From bookstores to art galleries to a shop that sold nuts and spices until we came upon an @CAPS-cream shop. After walking around for the day, @CAPS-cream was the best thing in our mind to have at the time. I had a very peculiar flavor with berries in it. But I've yet to try a significantly better flavor. When we got our @CAPS-cream my uncle began to share stories of @LOCATION which is where he was visiting from. Quite honestly I wish I could have gone back with him to @LOCATION, it sounded like a grand city with plenty of places to explore. Sadly I could not, but it is now my goal to eventually visit him where he is living in @LOCATION. We finished our @CAPS-cream and then made our way toward the car and drove to @PERSON to eat at a very good @CAPS restaurant @NUMo @CAPS's. We dined there and our stomach was full of exquisite food, almost an entire day of very tasty and savory delights. That was my uncle's @DATE day in @LOCATION. I now wish he would visit more often because of the good time we had on our little expedition across @LOCATION with the plethora of bad jokes and stories along with it.",20,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

I saw my friends sitting in seats directly behind one in other @CAPS I stopped and said to them,      ""@CAPS guys make it @CAPS hard to choose."" I smiled sarcastically.   @PERSON who was sitting behind @CAPS motioned for me to sit with her. I gave @PERSON a quick smile and told her that @CAPS and I would turn around and talk with her. @PERSON smiled as @CAPS leaned her head against my seat. @CAPS and I gave @PERSON about five minutes of quiet, then we started talking with her. About the time we arrived at the middle school, we all were having a swell time. Until then @CAPS and I were fine! But as soon as the bus left the middle school, we were in an uproar of laughter! Everything @CAPS said made me laugh and everything I said made her laugh too! After we left the middle school though, this little sixth grader came to sit in front of us and boy was he annoying! He kept turning around, giving @CAPS and I weird stares and asking us how many joints we had smoked. Of course that made @CAPS and I crack up even more! I was blabbing about how I had stuff in my biology book. But I was talking about notes! The boy obviously thought I was talking about joints. Well for one, I will not smoke, try it, or let it ever come near me. @CAPS I thought it was absolutely hilarious that he thought I meant joints. @CAPS who was sitting to the left of me, had her head on the seat crying because @CAPS was laughing @CAPS hard. Seeing this, I laughed even harder @CAPS that the sounds coming out of both of us, were the silent and deadly laughter. The boy still turned around with stares and added eyebrows. As soon as we passed the fruit packing company, he started taking in @CAPS to us. Now I'm trying to learn @CAPS, @CAPS I didn't have the faintest idea of what he was saying to us. Neither did @CAPS. Of course he didn't know what he was talking about either. He was leaning over in the isle to talk to these native @CAPS speakers who were also watching us with huge smiles on their faces. Being the comedian that I am, I decided to start talking about how he could know more @CAPS, then me when he was only in sixth grade!He of course quieted right down, but the @CAPS speakers were howling with laughter. I mean I was shedding tears the time @CAPS got off the bus. After @CAPS got off, I decided to check in on ol' @PERSON. @CAPS looked like @CAPS was trying to sleep, @CAPS I gently nudged her and @CAPS looked up at me. I had personally forgotten about @PERSON in the back until @CAPS got off at her stop.      ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS.k? Do @CAPS need a doctor?"" @PERSON asked with a confused grin on her face.I tried to talk, but was laughing in between all of my words,@CAPS it came out as pea soup!  ""@CAPS.k, now @CAPS really scare me!"" @PERSON retorted with a serious face. ""@CAPS come on @PERSON! I'm suppose to scare @CAPS! The freshman scare sophomores, sophomores - juniors,and juniors scare the seniors?"" I explained, laughing in between it all. Still my @CAPS sounded like pea soup.  ""@CAPS, but @CAPS still scare my personally. Don't do that!"" @CAPS belted out laughing. I had put my face over the seat, then lowered my head @CAPS that all @CAPS could see were my eyes. I then did my @CAPS @CAPS eyebrow thing in which I move my eyebrows from one side of my forehead to the other, in a wave motion. I thought that I was making her laugh! Which I was, but the outburst made even more people look at us. I mean the attention was fine. But the boy still would interrupt @PERSON and I. He was just blurt out,"" @CAPS bueno? @CAPS bueno?""  @PERSON and I again would just look at him. He of course was soaking all the attention in. He then I think, insulted my mother, which @PERSON pointed out.But I didn't care at that point because I was in such a happy mood, that I wasn't going to let someone who I didn't even know, ruin it. Both @PERSON and I looked up to see her stop coming up. It was really something to think back to all we have done together on the bus. The famous disappearing bus driver ride was a hilarious day and @CAPS was the proof reading my @CAPS paper bus ride. Good times. I told her this as @CAPS was getting off the bus. @CAPS laughed and @CAPS did I.     Finally, when the bus reached my stop, I crossed over the road and headed home. For fun I decided to look back at the bus. I did and saw the boy starring at me. I lost it then.",20,15,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12619,21170,8," I met my best friend @PERSON when we were in kindergarten. At the time we were both shy, and we looked to one another for comfort. Little did we know the acquaintances we made with each other would soon blossom into a wonderful friendship full of good memories, and plenty of laughter. Last @DATE, my family took a trip to my grandparents' house in @LOCATION, @LOCATION. My grandparents usually only used the house once a year in the @DATE, so while they were home in @LOCATION my parents decided to take advantage of the empty house. Both of my siblings are in their twenties and are busy with college, so my parents invited @PERSON to attend. We were so excited, for this was our first time to @LOCATION together. @PERSON and I had many activities planned and I couldn't wait to show her around @ORGANIZATION (@LOCATION @PERSON). The only downside of the trip was that we would be driving, we would be in the car for about @NUM hours. I had known this since we used to go to @ORGANIZATION a lot when I was little so I brought along a notebook that we could draw in and write in. By the time we got to @ORGANIZATION that notebook had been filled from cover to cover with drawings and funny sayings that @PERSON and I had quoted each other for. @PERSON and I have an odd kind of humor, we think everything is funny when were together. It can be the most ridiculous thing and we will burst out laughing and no one will know why.  Finally, a good @NUM hours later we arrived in @LOCATION, it was late though and we had to unpack, therefore I wouldn't be showing @PERSON around until the next day. That didn't mean our night wasn't exciting, in the backyard of the house there is a pool house, and in order to keep someone at the home when no one is there my grandparents rent out the pool house. My parents had known that a man named @CAPS lived in the pool house. None of us had met him, only heard stories from when my brother lived in the main house when he attended college in @ORGANIZATION. That night my mom asked me to go get my dad from the back yard because dinner was ready, it was dark outside so I made @PERSON come with me. When we got outside we saw my dad had introduced himself to @CAPS. @CAPS looked exactly how I imagined him, he had on red shorts, no shoes and a peach colored t-shirt. He had sandy blond hair and was pretty scruffy, he looked like a big beach bum. @CAPS quickly made his way over to me and @PERSON and introduced himself. He was pretty nice and very goofy. Throughout our whole conversation @PERSON and I couldn't keep straight faces.@CAPS said that he had to go so he wanted to teach us a handshake that he made up. He stuck his hand out and curled his index, ring, and middle finger so that they were in towards his palm and the only remaining fingers sticking out were his pinky and thumb. He gestured us to do the same thing. We all did as he told us and stuck our hands in the center of where we were standing and he tapped his pinky and thumb against our pinkies and thumbs, he said good evening and ran back to the pool house. It was very odd, but so funny that my dad, @PERSON and I still do this on occasion.  The next day, I took @PERSON downtown, and showed her around. When we were on our way back we stopped inside a craft store, that I, nor @PERSON had ever been in. When we walked in it looked like any other average craft store, but as we explored a little more we noticed there was a huge section of armor and helmets that @CAPS soldiers wore. Us being big dorks decided that we had to put them on, so we put on the helmets and armor and stood by the windows in the front shop and waved at people. The ladies working in the craft shop were laughing at us and it had us laughing at ourselves too. We fell down from laughing so hard, at this point the people who were working were not laughing anymore they were mad that we had fallen while wearing the armor. They came over and told us to take it off and that we needed to leave. We did what they told us to do. By the end of the trip we had made so many memories, and we couldn't wait to return the following year. In my opinion laughter is very important in relationships, it is healthy and it means that sometimes you don't need words to express how you feel. This @DATE @PERSON and I will be returning to @LOCATION @PERSON and are looking forward to many new memories and laughs that we will share.   ",22,17,0.0,39,0.0,0.0,0.0,39.0
12620,21171,8," In the @DATE on the month of @DATE, I experienced laughter on a grand scale. If I recall the memories correctly, the event began on the day of @CAPS, when my family gathered for a celebration. The day began normally as any @CAPS, when all were busy attempting to prepare for a feast, and I lobbying around, careless and oblivious to the world around me. Even so, I am able to work with my parents and complete the preparations for that day. It was a sudden burst of joy that finally did me in. A burst of laughter and joy came to me without reason or sanity, I just enjoyed. People, my family, looked upon me with confused eyes, bewildered by my actions and expressions, kept distance from me. Though I continued I still felt a sense of worry, for if I had lost my mind they too would lose faith in my social prowess. For that very day, I noticed a different side to me, a side that I wish would vanish from my being. Never again will I look into a mirror and unto myself, see the sane person I use to acknowledge. The day after the bizarre and unkind gesture I had made among my peers, I attempted to apologize for my actions. Although the first attempt seemed to startle them, seemingly due to the nature of my conversations and excuses made during the short interviews. So onward I continued in my life, again oblivious to my surroundings, yet it differed in my earlier life. I felt a kind and gentle side of myself be released, a relentless stress was lifted from my shoulders and allowed me to continue in my daily life. This is when I noticed another person burrowed into my soul, my alter-ego coming to light and possessing my body. This other being, this alter-ego, I gave the name @PERSON, and with these new emotions that came with I accomplished great feats. Even today he sometimes comes out in times when I have accomplished feats of knowledge or endurance. He gives strength to me, by providing a promise of laughter to me and all peers surrounding me. I view him, as not another person so to say, however as another part of my being. Never before that day did this other side of me come into light so clearly and with such promise. I do believe that we all have this person, this personality within us, empowering us to drive forth and never look back.End.",20,15,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12621,21174,8,"                   Laughter is the Shortest Distance Between Two People A thing we have done since birth is laugh. Laughter is something incredible in the world of human existence, it is something that relieves awkward situations, brings people together, and makes life a little bit easier. Laughter is something that everyone shares in common. Some people find laughter in different things than others but still we can all laugh together. Many times in my life has laughter helped me through tough situations, brought me close to someone, and just made life more enjoyable.   I remember once I was trying out for a volleyball team. It was the first day of tryouts and I was really nervous because I didn't know anyone. I had never even heard of these people and now I was going to be competing against them. There was one thing I knew about them though. It was that we all shared a common goal of making the team and being successful. Tryouts began and I felt like they were wondering why I was even there, but I ignored them and just kept working hard. Tryouts went okay for the rest of the week but still something just didn't feel right. I still felt like I didn't belong there. It was the last day of tryouts and the girls had warmed up a little, but I still felt a little uncomfortable. After the last practice it was time to announce the teams. I was really nervous cause what if I didn't make it? Or what if I did, but everyone hated me on the team? He announced the names and I was beginning to give up hope when he said my name. I was so excited, but the girls seemed to be annoyed by my name getting called. When I got home I told my parents and they were excited for me. I then told them how I didn't really know anybody and kind of felt like an outsider. They asked me if I had tried talking to anyone, and I said no not really they didn't try talking to me so I thought why should I? My mom then told me that I could only get to know them if put myself out there. I thought about it and realized I really hadn't. I ignored them as much as they ignored me. I also wasn't myself, because I really am a cool person and I am fun to be around, I just for some reason I crawled into a shell this time. I decided the next day at practice I would put myself out there. The next practice I showed up and was partnered up with a girl named @PERSON. It was so awkward and at first we were just quiet passing the ball back an forth. Then I started talking to her and making jokes she laughed and I laughed and we had a great time. The rest of the practice went great. The awkward moments faded away into laughter. We all worked hard and joked around with each other, laughed, and I really felt like we were bonding. They laughter had brought us together. All this time it felt like we were so far away and different and really it wasn't like that at all. Having fun and laughing together showed us how much we had in common and that we were all the same. I believe that day that laughter brought our team together.  I will never forget that day. It was the day I learned how important laughter was in a relationship, getting to know someone, and how well it brings people together. That season of volleyball I made many new friends. I also learned a valuable lesson that and awkward situation can always be turned around by laughter. Today I still talk to those girls on the team and still today we all laugh together, just because you known someone for a while doesn't mean the fun and laughter has to fade away, because I believe it should get stronger. Whenever I am meeting new people I always try to break the ice and lighten up the mood with something funny, because I think that a big point in our lives is to be happy, have fun, and all laugh togther. That is exactly what I plan to do.",20,22,0.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0

Maybe because we are upset, or to make a situation more comfortable, to get to know someone better, even to just get a conversation started. I was @NUM years old, I was finally hired for a job. I am now an employee for @ORGANIZATION. Being the youngest guy @CAPS the crew, I had to make an impression. I didn't know @CAPS to do. My first few days were awkward and silent.I was so nervous, i kept thinking to myself "" @CAPS am I doing, I don't belong here. I don't know anyone, don't knowwhat i am doing."" @CAPS one of the hottest days of the year, we had finished our work for the day and everyone @CAPS the crewwas going to the river. I wasn't planning @CAPS going, until @CAPS, one of the guys that i will also be going to school with came up to me and said "" hey @CAPS @CAPS need a ride to the river?"" and @CAPS laughed. "" @CAPS could @CAPS give me a ride to my house to grab a pair of shorts?"" I replied.  "" @CAPS I'll lend @CAPS a pair."" @CAPS said. "" I don't think @CAPS'll have a pair that will fit my fat ass."" I replied. "" @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS i do lets go."" @CAPS said @CAPS, and I walked over to his truck and went to his house. I noticed something as soon as I got into his truck, a bottle with @CAPS I thought was coffee in it. I asked him. "" @CAPS do @CAPS need coffee in the morning?"" I said "" @CAPS are @CAPS talking about?"" @CAPS replied "" The bottle."" I said "" @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS dumb ass, that's not coffee that chew spit."" @CAPS repliedI just left it at that. We got to his house, walked in through the garage, and there was the cutest dog i had ever seen,her name was @ORGANIZATION. She followed us though the house, and @CAPS gave me the tour. Then handed me a pair of shorts and we went @CAPS our way. We all met back up at work, and went from there. This being my first time going to the river with them, I saw so much of the property that i had never seen before. We went past our hay barn and down a gravel road. to this gate, which led to the river. I had never seen the gate, I'm riding in the bed of @CAPS's truck, bouncing around. The road has so many ruts. Once we reach the river,everyone starts changing. My bosses daughter is there and our crew leader's girlfriend. And I glance over at them once there dressedand my crew leader, @PERSON, looks at me and says ""@CAPS"". and so I turn around and @CAPS's tossing the cooler at me. I try and @CAPS the cooler but it throws me to my butt. Everyone starts laughing even I do, @CAPS comes over and helps me up and says, "" that's for looking at my cousin and girlfriend."""" @CAPS I looked, hell i aint got no chance of hooking up with them anyway"" I replied. Everyone laughed, and that's how we started out day at the river. In a great mood. We sit around and listen to music talking and having fun.Then @CAPS and @PERSON, start floating down the river. So we all go, all of us trying to @CAPS up. We finally do all of us are sore from the rocks @CAPS our rears. There is this log I see, sitting in the river. I climb to the top, and try a back flip. Only to show off of course. some how @CAPS perfectly in the river. All of us start jumping off and having a good old time.   It starts to get dark, and we get to the bank, start walking back. everyone going a different way because we all know the best way back.we all finally make it back. And go up to @CAPS house, once we reach the house, they decide we're going out to eat. Once we get to @ORGANIZATION all order, @PERSON says to me "" @CAPS o, @CAPS know we were all kinda worried about @CAPS, @CAPS never spoke."" "" I had nothing to say"" I replied."" @CAPS know, your gonna get yourself in trouble checking out a guys family and girl"". @CAPS said."" I know, but i cant help it"". I replied. I looked over at his cousin and winked."" @CAPS have some balls, but I'm glad @CAPS @CAPS the crew"". @CAPS said. That's when I knew, I was finally welcomed. That night I stayed at @CAPS's, and we just sat up watching @CAPS and joking back and forth.Now after looking back, I see that a good sense of humor can go a long ways. creates a good relationship.

You know when your in a new class and you don't know anybody in there so its kinda awkward because you feel like your a loner. I try to make the best of a situation and try to make new friends but I'm not always the best at it, so when i get a chance i make them laugh. First we take baby steps and the more we laugh together it seems like the closer we are to each other. By the end of the semester you don't really like the class but you don't want it to be over because you made such a good friend. The next semester you find out you have a class with that person but they don't like the class so they move out. Then you realize you guys kinda grow apart because you never see each other and if you never talk then it gets kinda awkward. The way we started off our friendship was really by accident but i didn't know many people in the class and the people that i did know weren't really my friends. We sat by each other, and after so long of awkward silence between us two she made a joke and i started to laugh. The next thing we know is within a week and would talk to each other and soon enough we hung out some. About half way through the semester we would get in trouble in class for talking to much and we started to realize we were starting to be best friends. The semester went on and we were hanging out more and more and she was the only one i would hang out with sometimes. By the time the semester was almost over we didn't know what our classes were so we thought we would be split up. The day we got our schedules we talked to each other and seen what our classes were. We seen we had one class together and we were excited. The first day of the second semester we went into the art class that we had together and we were laughing the whole time. At the end of the period she told me she didn't want to be in that class because shes not an artsy type of person. I went to my sixth period and was wondering if she was actually going to switch out like she said or not. At the end of sixth period I seen her and she told me that she got switched out and went to a class that she wanted. I know people in that class still but its not the same because I knew we were going to lose our friendship because we would never see each other. Its a couple weeks into the last semester and we hardly ever talk sometimes it gets awkward just to be around her because its not like how it used to be.

12625,21178,8," @CAPS is laughter important? In my opinion, laughter is very important! How could laughter affect someones life? If there was any, or not? Also, @CAPS is laughter important to me? Laughter is important for so many reasons. In a relationship, every day life, and with the ones you have in your life. How would the world be if there wasn't any laughter in this world? It would be very dry and dull. It helps connect people together, if they have the same sense of humor. Having a good sense of humor is very important these days. A lot of people use sarcasm which isn't ""laughter"" but to some people it could be or some could feel hurt by it. However, most people that feel hurt by it,don't have a sense of humor in any way, shape or form. Most people have heard the saying, ""it takes more muscles to frown then smile,"" that is a very true and factual fact! Having a glorious relationship is the best thing with my significant other. The affectionate that he can be by sharing our laughter together, brings us closer to a point where we couldn't be at all if there wasn't for laughter and communication. Having a a sense of humor is a important thing in a relationship, to most people. @CAPS would you want to be with someone who bores you? Who @CAPS't make you laugh when your sad? I sure wouldn't want that. Laughter brings out great communication skills, by laughing with someone it shows your type of opinion on the subject you are talking about. In a relationship, could you imagine if there wasn't no laughter in it? Would you feel the same about the person your with if there isn't any laughter? How would you feel knowing the person you love isn't very ""humorous"" and @CAPS't like to laugh often? I couldn't handle that. I would want to love someone who is very funny with a great sense of humor.  Laughter is important to me for so many reasons. I would rather be around very ecstatic people then someone who brings me down! I consider, laughter to be one of the most important things in my life, and in my relationship with my significant other. It brings us closer. People ask, "" @CAPS't it ever get old being happy all the time?"" ""Of course not!"" I would say in defense. @CAPS would someone think that way? Being in a phenomenal mood all the time, would be the most amazing place I would want to be in my life and with my partner.  In my opinion, I would think that almost everyone would feel close to what I'm saying. However, people have their own opinions about laughter and how and @CAPS it's important, there are titled to their opinion. I know a few people, that don't like to be in a very cheery mood, that would prefer to be sad all the time and not care. Laughter could raise you up from that!",15,16,0.0,31,0.0,0.0,0.0,31.0

Full with all different ages of players. we all were civil with each other at practices but we weren't all best friends that wanted to hang out outside of practice. The @CAPS team decided to take a retreat to the beach and stay @CAPS for a weekend.  When we went to leave to the beach our phones were taken and we had assigned seats in the cars. This trip seemed like it was going to be a long one with out my phone. We arrived at the house @TIME. As we all found somewhere to relax, shower or sleep myself and most of the team ended up in the living room conversing with the coaches. we all sat on the floor recalling stories about the game from that @TIME or funny stories from our past. By the time we finished telling stories it had reached @TIME and everyone in the house was either tired or hungry.  As we sat on the floor complaining about tiredness or hunger we all started to turn our attention to @LOCATION. @PERSON was starting to go on a tirade about how hungry she was. In her opinion she thought the house we were staying in should of already been stoked with food for us for when we got @CAPS, but @CAPS was no food. As she continued on her rant she became more and more mad which made us laugh harder and harder. Finally she reached her point. ""@CAPS's no steak or chicken up in these mother freak-in cabinets."" @PERSON proclaimed. At that point the coaches and players started laughing uncontrollable. @PERSON didn't understand why it was so funny, but we kept laughing and laughing at the fact that she just said that @CAPS should be steak and chicken in the cabinets. The outburst of laughter continued on for the next five to ten minutes.  When we finally started to calm down @PERSON came down stairs. She had missed everything that had happened and as we went to fill her in @LOCATION stopped us.

The love for basketball, and most of all the ability to be able to come together as a team all because of the memories we shared that @TIME in the kitchen. Today we still @CAPS on each others nerves and sometimes we lose our tempers with another but, we will always laugh about the crazy things that happened on the trip but the thing we laugh about the most is @CAPS happened that @TIME in the kitchen.

But I didn't know @CAPS awaited me in the computer lab..... Thanks to new @ORGANIZATION state testing laws, we have to take the writing test on the computer.

The funny thing was when she sat down she said ""@CAPS saved my life."". For some reason @PERSON and I just started laughing non-stop. We couldn't control it. To be honest, it wasn't that funny. I guess it was just in the way she said I saved her life. I'm glad @PERSON sits next to me in @CAPS @CAPS. With out her, it would be so boring.  In @CAPS, we sit next to each other and we have a good time. Our @CAPS class is at the end of the day so we are just ready to go home by then. @PERSON and I sit next to each other and when we are taking notes, @PERSON and I pass notes back-and-forth to each other. She and I talk about everything, from the predicaments a teenage girl runs into in high school, to boys and parents. I can pretty much tell her everything, and that's a good friend. Over the years @PERSON and I have become closer and closer friends. Last year, she and I had at least three or four classes together. So we have been in classes together previously. @PERSON and I have become more acquainted and more open with things. I tell her everything and she tells me everything. One reason why I think we've become good friends is because she and I find the same things funny. We have the same interests in things.She is a good friend and I'm glad she's my friend . Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I am going to definitely have to agree with that.",15,16,0.0,31,0.0,0.0,0.0,31.0
12630,21183,8," Hi my name is @CAPS. I am just an ordinary girl with a story like every other girls. I'm writing this because this story means something to me and I would like to share @CAPS. Honestly I depend on a good laugh during my day. Without laughter life would never be the same for me. Laughing has brought me to who I am today. Not only has @CAPS made me the person I am but @CAPS has brought me to all my friends and the people I love. For example I use laughter between me and my boyfriend @PERSON.  @PERSON and I are just like any other couple. We have fun, do stuff together and we argue. The worst part is when we fight. just like everyone else we have hard time and we have good times. Our hard times all start when we wake up. When i wake up its still really dark outside. The smell of fresh @TIME air makes me feel refreshed. I always feel like the happiest girl in the world. A little while after i wake up i text @PERSON good @TIME and we usually, always talk through out the @TIME. Some times he comes to see me or i just see him at school. When i see him i am happy and my toes curl. We will go for a walk and talk about everything and anything, just life. At this point he thinks its time to say something funny. So he does, he will make fun of how i look, what i am wearing and what i say. He doesn't find @CAPS hurtful but to me @CAPS is. Many times i might even say something mean back which doesn't help @CAPS just makes @CAPS worse.  Not long goes by, maybe a few seconds and we start to fight. He doesn't understand he has hurt me or he doesn't care. @PERSON tells me he has done nothing wrong. So i try to explain @CAPS and he doesn't listen. I just stop trying and if he realizes how he hurt me or what happened that bothered me that's fine but i am not going to fight anymore so i just stop explaining things. Enough has gone through my mind so i cry, and he gives me a dumbness look. This just makes everything worse so of course our fight breaks out and gets even worse. There is yelling and screaming with tears and mean, rotten words tossed all over the place its a mess. I usually storm of in the middle @CAPS cause i cant take anymore.  Finally time goes by and we haven't talked all day. We don't have anything to say to each other. Eventually someone gets the nerve to talk or say something to another. Still each of us on edge so i say something stupid or funny to lighten the mood. I will do anything to see a smile on his face, even if we have done each other wrong i still love him and cant stand for @CAPS to be like this anymore. Of course he smiles, just what i was looking for this makes me happy and laugh. @PERSON will than ask for a hug and so he hugs me even if i don't answer or if i say no, @CAPS doesn't matter to him. He apologizes and explains a couple things to me. I feel bad cause i hate the stress and the fight, so we work @CAPS out.  Now you can see if i didn't have laughter i might be depressed. Without laughter things would be harder and more complicated. But a good laugh or a simple joke can ease things and make them a lot better in life. I just want people to understand what a small laugh can do to your day. If @CAPS can change your day in such a big way than @CAPS can change your life in a major way. Things @MONTH come across as hard of rough. When i look back on my life and see what @CAPS has done to me and for me i realize i laughed at something each one of those days even though i was done and @CAPS brought me back up again.",18,18,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12631,21185,8,"It's true @CAPS they say, time flies when you're having fun. On a particularly warm @DATE @TIME, a rehearsal was in session for the wonderful production of ""The @CAPS @CAPS"" and I was bringing my best friend, @PERSON some cheap but delicious food. We talked and ate for a while but eventually it was time for me to go. @CAPS we were walking down the stairs to get to the back doors of the building I asked if they needed any help with the play. ""@CAPS a matter of fact we do!"" @CAPS said enthusiastically. ""We need a ladies costume @CAPS.""I had absolutely no idea @CAPS that meant, but I felt that the position had potential. ""@CAPS, I can do that. Just one question..."" I said a little confused.""@CAPS?"" @CAPS replied, slightly amused.""@CAPS exactly am I going to @CAPS doing?"" I asked her.We changed course and headed for the costume room so that @CAPS could introduce me to, @PERSON who would @CAPS my boss for the next two weeks. We arrived to find that @CAPS had already gone home for the night. A little exasperated, @PERSON told me the basic idea of the job.""@CAPS basically @CAPS's going to happen is that you are going to @CAPS in charge of the changing rooms and the costume changes on stage."" @CAPS said quickly.""@CAPS okay, I can do that."" I replied with confidence.@CAPS I began to talk to her more about @CAPS I would @CAPS doing @CAPS said that @CAPS had to go because break was over. ""@CAPS here at @NUM tomorrow morning and you'll learn everything you need!"" @CAPS said hurriedly.@CAPS @CAPS ran off into the theatre I could hear the lead of the play beginning his lines. ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice....""I left feeling more happy and excited than I have felt in months.  The next morning I made my way to the theatre which is located at the school which I previously attended. It felt odd going back there but at the same time so completely normal. I was even more comforted by knowing that I could see my friends everyday. I could hug them and laugh with them, I could have social interaction! Something that because of online school I have been lacking. I walked into the theatre and @CAPS soon @CAPS I did I was bombarded with excited people asking why I was there while hugging me tight. ""I'm helping out with the costuming!"" I said just @CAPS excited @CAPS they were. I broke away from the group of people and found, @PERSON who was on stage directing the lighting people. We talked for a while and then @CAPS took me to the costume room where, @PERSON was waiting for me. @PERSON, was a classy looking lady. @CAPS wore a light grey cardigan and a colored top with some corduroy pants and sensible shoes. Immediately @CAPS started to tell me @CAPS my duties were and @CAPS I was going to @CAPS doing that day.""I'm just going to have you watch the rehearsal today, just to get a feel of @CAPS's going on."" @CAPS handed me a pen and a pad of paper""@CAPS notes about where the lighting ques are and that kind of thing."" @CAPS said.I walked out and wondered to the auditorium and took my seat in the second row of seats. The lights were lowered and rehearsal began. ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice...""@CAPS I knew it, the end of the day had come and I wasn't in any hurry to leave. The actors and crew were doing such an amazing job with the play but I knew I had my work cut out for me. In the end it all worked out beautifully, we had some good shows and some @CAPS shows but the most important part of this experience was the time I got to spend with the people I love. I am going to miss them so much when I'm sitting in my room all alone doing the school work that consumes my happiness and laughter into the internet. on the other hand, I am all lined up to help with the next two productions going on at that old school of mine.",20,22,0.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0
12632,21186,8," In life @CAPS share many of your moments laughing and enjoying the sweet and gentle sound of the chorus that @CAPS and the people in your life share. Laughter can bring @CAPS instantly to enjoyment no matter how unbearable the struggles in your life @MONTH be.  I've had many moments in my life that became enjoyable because of laughing and smiling. But one moment sticks out above the others. This moment is the @CAPS before my grandpa passed away. This @CAPS was the best of all. It was a white @CAPS, and for once the snow wasn't the only thing that was gleaming. On this day, everyone in my family was smiling, we were all thankful that my grandpa survived his sudden heart-attack that happened the week before and we all knew that his time was near. We had to make his last @CAPS a great one to end on.  My grandpa was the sweetest old man, he could always make @CAPS smile no matter how sad @CAPS were. He was a man, who enjoyed the laughter of his grandchildren and he made sure that he made an impact in our lives. This @CAPS though was one where our laughter made the largest impact.  On @DATE, everyone on my dad's side of the family drove over the hills to their destination; my house. The house was covered in @CAPS decor and was gleaming with the happiness that each one of us held inside of us. My grandpa was the first to walk in. I leaped into his arms and said ""I love @CAPS grandpa with all my heart! Merry @CAPS!"" @CAPS this he smiled and began to tickle me like he always did ever since I was little. He grabbed my hands and began twirling me around, humming his favorite song. As we were twirling to the tune of his favorite song, my laughter broke out. When this happened, I looked straight into my grandpa's eyes and saw the love that he had. He always said that ""The laughter of a young child can always bring joy to anyone, even the cruelest of people."" @CAPS we were still twirling, all my other family members walked into the house. They smiled and laughed at us, but we didn't care. This was going to be a great @CAPS, nothing could ruin it for us. When everyone got into the house we all sat down in the living room sharing stories of all the old and good times that we shared. We all knew that this was what my grandpa needed, and in his eyes we could all see that he was happy that he had a family, that could put away all of the hardships we were going through and allow ourselves to sit as a family and enjoy each other. Everyone was laughing now, remembering the stories that made our family what is was. My aunt @PERSON was the one that knew all of them by heart, she could even act them out. My grandpa sat there and laughed. He was filled with enjoyment as he watched his only daughter do what she did best.  When dinner was almost ready, my grandpa and I sat down at the dinner table all by ourselves. We began playing the game that we always played. I got underneath the table and hopped up in random seats acting like a cat. My grandpa would always say "" @CAPS down @PERSON, that food isn't for @CAPS."" then I would go and sit next to him and meow at his side, and we would just laugh. No one else understood the bond that my grandpa and I had. But that didn't matter, every holiday we were the ones that were always laughing; we enjoyed life and we never let anything @CAPS to us. He was the only one in my family that understood enjoyment and he helped me live my life that way.  Dinner was served and we all took our normal seats. My mother's food looked amazing like usual. My grandpa and I sat right across from each other like we always would and made the most unusual faces at each other. Our laughter filled the room and made that @CAPS even better. As we were all finishing our dinner, my grandpa got up and walked to the door looking outside at the beautiful landscape covered in a white blanket. I walked to his side and looked up at him. He smiled down at me and said ""@CAPS never realize the beautiful things in life, until your life is fading. The most beautiful thing to me is your laugh. It always brings joy to my heart. If I could only hear one more sound, it would be your laugh @PERSON, and if I could only see one more thing it would be your smile. I'm happy to be your grandpa and I'm glad that I got to live and see @CAPS grow up to be such a beautiful and sweet girl. Always remember, enjoy ever moment. Especially the moments with the ones that @CAPS love.""",21,18,0.0,39,0.0,0.0,0.0,39.0
12633,21188,8," Allot of people say that laughter is a big part of any relationship, and i agree allot of people don't always laugh and in every relationship laughter is a big component to make someones day of the greatest day they have ever had. There is always someone who is having a bad time in school or at home or any other place and when you see someone like that you should always cheer them up like saying something nice or just even saying something like hope you have a good day @DATE, give them a smile so that can put there bad thing that is avoiding them from laughing aside and you have just made there day by sharing your smile and laughter with them. Allot of people need someone they can go to when they are going through a very hard situation or problem they are going through that they cant go through it alone in there home or even at school and they need someone they can talk to and share there feelings with a shoulder they can cry on and that always makes someone feel good letting all that pain and inner self out to others we all need to make someone who is going through a hard time smile and laugh and that is always something very healthy in a relationship and it is a way to offer that person who is in pain or sad have e healing. This reminds me of a true story i know because i was there. One time there was a girl who i had in my elementary school she was a very happy girl she shared her laughter and happiness with others she was someone anyone could go to when they had a problem or they just needed someone to talk to she was one of the nicest girl in school everyone liked her and she tended to always show love and respect to others it always seemed as if her life was so perfect she had no worries she was just full of joy and she was only child in her family so of course her parents would always give her what she wanted or at least that's what we all thought. It had been a @DATE and we it came to be @DATE and we were all in school except this girl, she never missed a day of school so it was very strange for her not to be there, but just as every other person she must have been sick so that's what we thought except she missed another day and then another, and another, so i was starting to think she had moved away and she was probably never coming back, but the next week after that she showed up i was very happy to see her i had missed that girl except there was something very different about her she wasn't the same she wasn't laughing or smiling anymore she had lost that sparkle that made her so different. I thought to myself ""what is wrong with her?"" i finally found out that she had been gone because her mom had past away i was so sad i didn't know what to say she was just so happy and from one day to another she didn't have her mom anymore i thought i have both of my parents and she doesn't i should share the happiness she had share with me and others right back to her and be there for her now that she was gong through the hardest time of her life. That's why being happy and sharing your happiness with others always is the greatest thing you can do for someone because you never know what kind of things there going through and they need someone to make them smile and laugh.",17,20,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12634,21189,8," Building the @CAPS with Laughter @CAPS a very early age my uncle would bring the funniest cards to mine and my brothers birthdays, just to see our reaction. Then when my uncle moved to the west coast, near us, we would piss each other off just see each others reaction. We have always known when each other is having a bad day and when to lift them up when they are down.  When my family and I would go back to @CAPS at an early age, we would always celebrate each others birthdays with our uncle. He would bring the funniest cards to give us and we would sit there and laugh about them for hours. Then when he moved to @LOCATION my older brother, @PERSON, and I started to get him funny cards to see who had the best one. We got each other cards that had sexual humor to gross humor. We would come to each others birthdays with a grin, @CAPS one ear to the other, waiting for the person to open up the card. One year, for his birthday, I got him a card that had some older ladies on it and had some sexual humor towards it. Lets just say nobody has beaten that card. My uncle and I work in the same building but doing way different jobs. He is the sales manager and I put the items together for him to sell. When I walk into work, I always pass by him to see how he is doing. For the most part, he is either laughing or pissed off about something in his day. On days that he is upset and walks outside to make a label for @ORGANIZATION, I start to make fun of him right away. Sometimes he gets even more angry. But when he does, he always seems to laugh after the fact, or come back at me with a rude remark. Everyday this happens and it always seems to brighten up our days.  We bought two season passes to @CAPS.Hood this year. At first I wasn't very good at skiing, and would always fall. When I would fall, he would board down to me while laughing and I would get very upset. We would laugh on the way home talking about how I would always fall. But as time went on, I slowly got better than him and would be waiting for him at the bottom of the run. One time, when we went up, he just couldn't seem to stay on his board and would fall non-stop. This was the time when I could finally get him back for all the times when he laughed at me for not being able to stay on my skis. I never laughed so hard in my life on that ride home. Coming down and making remarks at him about not being able to stay on his board was one of the most warming things I have ever felt. It wasn't warming for me to make rude remarks. It was warming to me, to see that he couldn't say anything back, because his time finally came to be made fun of.  My uncle and I have the relationship we do today, because of his impact on me at an early age. Him being able to make me laugh at his jokes and knowing when to brighten up my day has been one of the best things that has happened to me to date. Changing my life for the best and changing my personality for the best. These laughing experiences have turned our ""uncle-nephew"" relationship into a friend relationship.

12635,21190,8," When I was in what I believe to be the sixth grade I went to @ORGANIZATION. This year I felt as if I was old enough to ride the "" big kid"" rides which I had never done before. I remember walking up to the entrance of the @CAPS @CAPS hotel with my mom, older sister @PERSON, @ORGANIZATION little sister @CAPS. We had to go though there because it was the fastest way in to the park. There were to giant stain glass like windows that led into the lobby of the hotel. The door were beautiful. They had an outdoor seen on them there were bears, fish, trees, rivers @ORGANIZATION mountains. We all walked in to the hotel. The ceilings must have been twenty feet tall. We walk all the way though the lobby @ORGANIZATION followed the signs till we got to the park entrance. There was a man made mountain in the middle shaped like a grizzly bear that one of the rides was built around. It was early in the morning so the @LOCATION heat had not yet set in completely. We started out with the smaller rides @ORGANIZATION side attractions like it's tough to be a bug @NUM,shopping in the park @ORGANIZATION parades. My mom was determent to get back in time to see @LOCATION on stage but we never made it back in time. It was about noon @ORGANIZATION the sun was hot. We were making our way to the pier. the song @ORGANIZATION by the @CAPS @CAPS was playing in the back ground. There were old sunscreen advertisements painted on the fence that was surrounding that end of the park. on the opposite side of the pier was a man made ocean that was so blue from all the dye it was unbelievable. It kinda looked like the water in the toilet when you put the blue cleaning product in it. The air smelled like fried food @ORGANIZATION popcorn, it was making me @LOCATION. We continued walking until be got to the roller coaster @ORGANIZATION'. There was a fifteen minuet wait time for the ride which wasn't long. my older sister @ORGANIZATION i jumped in line @ORGANIZATION began to wait. I had never been on a roller coaster this big before so I didn't know what to expect. I had butterfly in my stomach, I was getting nervous but didn't want to back down.  finally we came to the front of the line. the man standing there working the ride asked ""how many?"". my sister held up two fingers @ORGANIZATION the man pointed at the ground next to him @ORGANIZATION said ""row eight"". The next set of cars came in @ORGANIZATION they ushered us into the the eighth car in the row. I pulled down the safety bar. The ride began. The roller coaster cars pulled around the corner @ORGANIZATION stopped. There were speakers on both sides of my head that i had not noticed until the moment sound began to come out of them. It was a mans voice @ORGANIZATION some background music. the voice did a count down form ten @ORGANIZATION the yelled "" blast off"" @ORGANIZATION the ride took of at high speeds. It was going so fast my face was being pushed back into a smile. The ride then slowly climbed to the top of a giant hill @ORGANIZATION plummeted to the bottom. There were so many twists @ORGANIZATION turns the ride even when upside down! when it came time to take the picture at the end I was crying I was laughing so hard. my sister @ORGANIZATION I exited the ride @ORGANIZATION walked over to the booth were they show the pictures that they had taken of the people on the ride. Both of our faces were priceless. We then road the ride five more times before heading back to the hotel for dinner. From that day on I was addicted to roller coasters, @ORGANIZATION have ridden many since.",18,18,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12636,21191,8,"It was @DATE around @NUM degrees in west @LOCATION me and a couple of friend was really bored and hot all we really had to do was stay home and play video game. So I ended up coming up with the idea of going out side and maybe riding our bikes to the store, an grabbing some ice cream and water then ride up hamburger hill and possibly sit under the shade. Everyone agreed to the plan so all my friends left we all took showers at our homes and met me up at the corner and then rode our bikes off to the store got all the items and as we were making our way to the hill a couple of the big kids who were in middle school came and jumped us all and stole all our of food supplies. Now these guys have always been picking on us for some reason and till this day @CAPS still never understood why maybe it was because we didn't like what they did or maybe they hate us cause my friend @PERSON stole one of the kids girlfriends but that's a different story. So after they got done pounding our faces into the dirt they got on their bikes and rode off into the sunset like if they were proud of themselves for beating on @NUM yr old, our day was ruined i had a black eye,@PERSON threw up, @PERSON was walking with a limp and poor little @PERSON had a little scratch on his tiny little head. After the brutal beating the next day I called a group meeting in our tree house to be for real i was tired of them constantly beating on us stealing our food and giving us ultra wedgies we needed to make a stand against our oppressors cause for too long this has been going on so i devised a plan a perfect plan to make sure they never hurt us again and the plan went like this, @PERSON and @PERSON would talk to all of the kids that have been abused by them and get them to join our revolt,then we would get all of the water balloons eggs and rotten food we could. One of the kids knew that they always left their houses and got on their bikes at @NUM pm so at @NUM at night me and @PERSON would flatten a couple of their tires, each thing that came into my tiny little mind was just genius so after day's of planning and hard labor and complaining to our parents for money the plan was finally set, and so we waited and just like the kid said they all came out at @NUM once they noticed their tires had been slashed a couple of the kids jumped out of the bushes and started hurling food at them then me and a couple of the kids was riding past them on our bikes and threw water balloons at them they all split up the ones who's bikes weren't slashed they chased after us they were going pretty fast and nearly caught up with us when i gave the signal @PERSON and @PERSON pulled the rope and the big kids flew off their bikes and face planted like in the movies and it really seemed like the plan was going pretty well and it seemed like we were winning the war but as usual some thing are to good to be true it seems that we forgot about the other big kids in the neighborhood and when they saw this all hell broke loose soon after their reinforcements came in they over powered us like a lion on a gazelle beating each and everyone of us like we stole something but good thing i was being smart and told my parents and my friends parents on the kids and sooner our parents came yelled and screamed at them and told their parents what's been going on and as a godd ending they were grounded for the rest of them @DATE and finally we all played in peace without no fears.",11,18,34.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12637,21192,8,      Have you ever laughed so hard that you peed?That @MONTH or @MONTH not have happened to me. In my story I'm going to talk about the funniest time I have ever had with my best friend @CAPS.       How it all started was that it was my best friends birthday and she was going to spend the night at her grandmas house. She invite only me to come with her so I couldn't say no. @CAPS's grandma owned a @CAPS @CAPS. She was old and was in a @CAPS @CAPS club. I don't know about you but it always seems to me that old people have to be in some kinda of club. So anyways in her her club what the did was go on trips. @CAPS and I thought that would be fun to go on a trip. So we meant everyone at @ORGANIZATION.         @CAPS's grandma let us go intro the store to buy drinks for that trip. I wanted @CAPS. The bottle was really cool. It had a top like a water bottle would have. I got the red kind cause it the best. We got are drinks and @CAPS's grandma said to go to the car while she talked to the adults about the trip.      So here is the funny part of the story. I got into the car first. I was pretty thirsty so I decided to unscrew the cap it pulled open to paper back on the sell. I twisted the cap back on and took a drink. Mean while @CAPS got into the car and closed the door behind her cause her grandma was talking to the adults. While she was closing it she got her hair caught in the door. She was laughing and yelling at me to come help her. I was laughing too hard to come help her. I had my drink between my legs and the cap was open and remember its like a water bottle cap. I laughed so hard that I squeezed my legs together and my juice went straight into the front seat. It didn't get and were else just into her grandma seat. It was like a rocket it was so funny. @CAPS with her head still stuck in the door asked what that notice was on the seat. I told her it was my juice. Then was both started laughing.         I don't know why but @CAPS just pulled on her head and her head was no longer stuck. The was like ten pieces of her hair stuck in the car door. She looked at the seat and said we have to tell her grandma about it. I didn't want her to be mad at me cause her seats were white. I thought it would stain. But we ended up telling her. She told us to go get napkins from the bathroom. The whole time we were going to the bath room me and @CAPS were just laughing so hard. We cleaned up the mess and I didn't get in trouble.         I guess that I have never peed my pants laughing but I almost did that day. After that day me and my best friend @CAPS always laugh at that story. I am so glad we went on an old people @CAPS @CAPS club trip.                       ,15,20,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12638,21193,8," For a year and two months I'd devoted my life to horses, school, and @CAPS. We started off as friends in @CAPS grade, and it escalated to a relationship in @LOCATION grade. We ended up breaking up later on that year, but we continued to remain 'friends'. Obviously I still cared for @CAPS, but I didn't believe he'd felt the same. But apparently I was wrong, we began a new relationship on @DATE at @NUM pm.    It was the perfect start to our 'perfect relationship'. He and I were inseperable from the get go, we literally did everything together. I was @PERCENT irrevocably in love with @CAPS. Between the two of us, we shared some crazy memories and inside jokes. I could probably write a best selling novel of all the memories we had, and I honestly believed that @CAPS and I were going to be together forever. I thought everythign was going fine, till he had to lay it out, he liked someone else.   At that point, I had no idea where our relationship (or I) stood. I didn't want to know. I couldnt keep putting my heart in the open if it was going to get stomped on, but I loved @CAPS and was willing to do anything to make it work. I stayed the night with @CAPS, and we talked till @NUM. He and I decided to attempt to make it work, but there was no guarantee it was going to.     The next day, everything seemed fine. I was still extremely irritated that he liked another girl, but I was using all my power to make the best of what we had. We decidded to take his dog, @CAPS, on a walk. We held hands as we walked, but it was too quiet. Why? He was texting @CAPS. By that time, I decided that was the final straw. It felt like I was getting in the way, so I felt that the only choice I had left was to leave @CAPS.  I walked in the door an hour later absolutely devistated. I cried till I felt I couldn't cry anymore, and then I would cry more. At the time, I truly felt that the world was ending right before me. My life was over. My days became long and depressing, and I felt that all I could do was give up. My heart shattered everytime I saw @CAPS, and it made it even worse when people constantly asked about what had happened. I couldn't tell them, it wasn't a moment I would want to relive. I couldn't stop thinking about @CAPS, and about all the memories we'd shared. That year and two months has been the greatest period of my life.   Almost everytime I thought about @CAPS I would cry. I couldn't stand the thought of not having @CAPS, and thinking about @CAPS all the time made me into a walking zombie. I couldn't eat, I couldn't drink, and I would vomit because of the stress. But as I sat there in alone thinking of the memories, a miracle happened: I laughed. I was shocked, but it made me realize that I needed to keep living. I don't regret any of the time I spent with @CAPS, he changed my life. He taught me so much about loving someone. I knew from that small laugh, that things were going to get better. A spark of hope, I would be happy again. ",15,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12639,21194,8," The word (laughter) @MONTH mean a smile or something nice that has happened to someone or even a thank you, but for many people it means the action or sound of laughing. For many people the felling they get inside when they laugh is the felling of happiness. The sense of felling good inside is the meaning that ones in while you have to be happy in life; have a balance in your life. For me the word (laughter) means being happy and the felling of doing something good in life. For instance when a couple get married they need a sense of laughter in there life's so they can enjoy their companies. It was @DATE, @NUM, @NUM early in the morning I was extremely exited to leave because that was the day I was going to go visit my grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts, uncle, and cousins that I had not seen for about eight years. I remember that morning I felt a sense of happiness and sadness at the same time.I was about to leave for two months in a half I was going to miss my family and friends, but at the same time I felt happy and exited to go. That morning we arrived at the air port; I was about to ride on my very first airplane. As I tried to find my seat through the big line of people that were finding their seats as well; I sat down and buckled my self into the seat and looked out the window and all over the place. My stomach was turning in circles round and round and I had the felling of a roller coaster about to take off really fast. The next thing I knew the plane was moving I got kinda of scared, but at the same time I was excited.  During the flight I felt a sense of laughter in my soul; the memories of a childhood in @LOCATION were turning my emotions into laughter and tears that made me fell good I had never felt. The idea of seeing all my family and friend was captivate to my hear and emotions. As we arrived at the @LOCATION airport; my emotions were turning in circles back and forth. We only had two more flights left to get to our destinations. I was getting tired and sleepy, my legs and arm's hurt so bad, they felt like if you were caring two big bags of potatoes on each side of my leg and arms . We decided go eat some place as we walked around to see what we could find to eat we found pizza huts. The next thing I knew was that we had only one hour our to the next flight, so we agreed to head to our next flight. As we arrived to the gate people were already going in through the hallway to get into the plane so we hurried. Three hours past buy and we had landed in @LOCATION, @LOCATION that was our destination. I felt a sense of laughter inside of me as we waited for our ride home; the feeling I got was as if someone had token something from me and gave it back. I started to cry at that moment, but at the same time I was laughing. We arrived that late afternoon to my grandparents house, as I looked at them I felt a happy inside, they were happy as well. we decided to spend the @TIME over at my grandparents house, that @TIME nobody had gone to sleep every one was to busy talking with each other and catching up. The next day every one was tired and sleepy, but they were all happy and full of laughter inside.  We had spent a mouth in a half with family members that I had not seen in a while we all felt happy and with a sense of laughter inside. Everyone had an incredible time catching up with family and friend. We did not get to do all the things we wanted to, but the best part was the time I has with my family and friends. The word laughter to me mean the best thing that has happens to you and makes you fell good inside, or even the memories you think about when you are alone and sad, those are the memories that will make you laugh and fell good about yourself. Other people @MONTH say that laughter is the felling you get when you laugh, but laughter is the best felling in the world when you are happy. In this part of my life laughter was an important element of my whole life and it still is a great part in my life. Over many generations people have used the benefits of laughter in their life's for instance many famous and non- famous people, important people or non- important. Many people say that when you are not happy you are going to die not knowing what happy is. People really enjoy those moments that they spend with a special someone.",22,20,0.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0
12640,21195,8," There will always be moments in your life when your emotions will take control and motivate you. whether your happy, sad, angry or frustrated. At times like this I use my gift, the gift of laughter. My best friend, @PERSON looked at me with her big blue eyes, they were swelled up with tears. We had just finished packing the rest of her clothes and we knew it was time to say goodbye. It hurt me deeply to see her go after five years of friendship but, we had postponed this moment long enough. There the boxes sat waiting, each with their own label, they had all of our memories inside. We were never very serious, we liked to joke a lot and she always knew how to make me smile, today that would be hard though. After we put @PERSON's stuff in the moving van I noticed her dog, @PERSON wasn't outside like he normally is. When I went inside I found out he hadn't been hiding in there either. This was strange because @PERSON was the type of dog that liked to have a lot of attention so he was always near you. When I told @PERSON that @PERSON was missing, we went to look for him.    It was @DATE time, my favorite time of year and the sun felt warm against my skin. I remember this moment very clearly, it was a memory I was sure I would want to savor. As we walked along @PERSON and I talked about all sorts of things, this made me almost forget she was going to have to leave in a few hours. Just then I noticed a shinny silver object laying in the ground, from where I was standing I couldn't quite read what the engrave stated but I could see the one letter that said it all, the letter @CAPS. It was @PERSON's red and blue collar, I reached down and picked it up I figured he must be somewhere near. Fate must have been with us that day because as soon as we glanced up the road we saw @PERSON riding in the back of someones old @ORGANIZATION truck. We started running after that truck as fast as we could and we were screaming, ""@CAPS! Finally the truck stopped in front of our local store, the guy stepped out and he seemed aggravated with us.""That's my dog."" @PERSON stated, and I just shook my head in agreement. The strange man looked at us in wonderment and then looked at @LOCATION. His face turned red in embarrassment as he too realized the dog in the back did not belong to him. This whole situation was funny and all we could do was laugh. With @PERSON beside us we started walking home, taking our time, dreading what would take place when we arrived back at @LOCATION's house. That night I stayed up thinking about @PERSON and @LOCATION, I was great full to that dog for running off so we could spend more time together. Also I was thinking that maybe he had a reason for leaving, maybe he knew that we weren't ready to say goodbye and we had to have one last adventure, one last laugh. When we laughed together for the last time that day, I knew that we would truly be friends forever no matter if she lived near or far.",20,18,36.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12641,21198,8,"  On the year of @DATE, my brother had the worst birthday headache ever. We lived in a nice big brown house. with great to loving parents. we had a nice big back yard, my brother and I loved that the most. @CAPS was down stars making my brother and i school lunches for school. It was my brothers first day of school and he was so happy. I mean its his birthday and he also starts school on the same day, thats awsome. @CAPS let my brother walk to school with me, it was only down the road. The school my brother and i went to is called @LOCATION. When we got to the school, I could tell my brother was worried. School to me didn't seem that bad but I wasn't the one who was caught eating glue ether. Yeah my brother was caught eating glue during arts and crafts before lunch. When I was on my way to the office I say him through the window. He turned his head and smilled, I could see all the glue still wet and it's everywhere.  My brother and me always had a good relationship, we both mad each other laugh all the time. If my brother and I didn't laugh at each other, we probable wouldn't talk to each other. Laughter to me is a very importent part to any kind of relationship. It alows poth people to share their emotions in a positive way. It also helps people see what kind of sence of humor you have.  As we approched the house, we saw @CAPS sitting on the porch waitting for us. After we got home my brother went straight to his room to get cleaned up for his birthday. @CAPS had my brother do the dishes, and I do the vacuming in the living room. She always wanted the house cleaned even if people dont come over. @CAPS said the whole family was coming over. My brother and i were so happy, we both new grandma was coming. When everyone got here we both were very happy. Grandma showed up alittle after dad did. @CAPS was in such a hurry, she wanted to see my brothers face when he saw his birthday cake. When grandma comes she always brings gifts for both of us on are birthdays. When my brother was at the table @CAPS brang in the cake. I always see my brother happy, but not like this. I could tell that nothing could make his day any happier.  When the birthday cake was over and the presients, my brother and i went out to the back yard to play kickball. My brother wouldnt use his new soccer ball, we were stuck with a basketball to play with. @CAPS and grandma were watching us play, we both were having fun. We laught every time I kicked the ball wrong, or if he missed when he tried to kick the ball. As we were kicking the ball I got an idea. I wound my leg back and as the ball came close i kicked it. I kicked the ball so hard and so fast, insted of the ball going to his feet it went to his head. When the ball conected to his head he did a back flip off the ground. @CAPS and grandma were in aw, i was frozen still. When he got up he looked straight at me and laught. @CAPS started to laugh so did grandma, i was still frozen. I finaily went with it and by the time I started i couldnt stop. it was so funny, he got pickup off the ground and hit in the head with a ball and still laughs.   When it was time for everyone to go, @CAPS said her good byes and then it was grandmas turn. Grandma gave my brother the first kiss on the forhead than me. As grandma was leaving my brother and i sat on moms lap and gave her a big hug and said ""I love you @CAPS"". @CAPS was tcking us in bed and was about to leave when my brother said "" @CAPS my head hurts"". I love my family and even today we look back on this and laugh. This has been a joy to write i hope you think so to.  Short story by   @ORGANIZATION @NUM",17,17,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12642,21199,8," Laughter, what is the meaning; to show mirth, joy, or scorn with a chuckle or explosive vocal sound. People without laughter in there life go through stages of depression or feel a sadness inside them; they never seem to be able to find the light at the end of the tunnel, ""the light being happiness."" The days @MONTH turn into to months or even years, life seems to be at a standstill.  When you feel there is no happiness you begin to have doubts on your decisions in life; the choices you have made in life seem to all be wrong. This is what my life felt like when the world turned around and I found out my best friend just flipped her car. I was traumatized, in shock; I didn't know so many things could rush through your head in that given moment. I instantly started to ask a million questions to see if she was okay. All they could share with me at the time was that she was being rushed to the hospital. All I could do once I got home was lay in my bed and think; what could I have done so she would not have been in that car-- all i felt was guilt! That night was wretched my mind just kept wrapping around all the times my best friend and I spent together, the laughter we shared between each other, stupid fights, and all the dumb pranks. What was eating at me most though was we had gotten in a fight not to long before she wrecked; the worst part was it was over the stupidest thing. I had got irritated at her for constantly ditching out on our plans we had together to go spend time with her boyfriend. Now that I look back at it, all I felt was jealousy. If only I could take it all back, then maybe she would not have been distracted while she was driving and missed her turn. That next morning her mother called me and said ""she is asking for you, you @MONTH come to the hospital and see her if you please."" I was ecstatic, I got ready faster than I ever have before; within a few minutes I was ready and in my pick-up driving myself to the @LOCATION hospital. It only took me thirty-five minutes to get there, when it should take you around forty -five. I instantly jumped out of my truck, rushed into the hospital and went to the check-in desk to see what room she would be in. They told me she was in room @NUM right down the hall on the left. I got to room @NUM, there was a crack in the door so I peeked in before trying to open the door the rest of the way; I finally got the confidence to open the door and go talk to her. She instantly had a smile on her face when she saw me, I pulled up a chair and sat right next to her. We talked for about an hour just about random things; including the wreck. She told me she had a few broken rips and a minor concussion, so she should be able to be out by that afternoon. When she told me that, I was one of the happiest people right at that moment. All I could do was laugh when she told me everything was fine; almost like laughter of relief. It did not take long before both of us started laughing, most of it was out of excitement and having nothing else to say; except the beautiful sound of laughter coming out of our mouths. I have to say it felt good just to be by my friends side again being able to share happy moments with each other. So what is the meaning of Laughter to me; shall you ask? It is the most meaningful thing that anyone could possible do. Laughter is to show signs of happiness, a giggle or an outburst; sharing unforgettable moments with a loved one.Without laughter your life can not be complete, make jokes, just laugh make life have meaning again. Do not go through life being @PERSON, instead be @PERSON. Go ahead test it out and see what laughter can do for you in your life!",18,17,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12643,21200,8," @CAPS whole life, I've been a child of laughter, one who did all @CAPS could to find the joy in existence. As I've grown, @CAPS hunger for delight hasn't ceased, and when I fell through a metal roof a few years back, @CAPS joyous obsession remained. The woman who gave me life is an only child. @CAPS has a few step-siblings, but it's a crew we never see. When I think of @CAPS relatives, those people never cross @CAPS mind. I actually can't even remember them. That fact makes @CAPS childhood seem void or vacant (considering that @CAPS father died when I was a tiny toddler), but there's no need to feel sympathetic towards me. I mean, sure, growing up in a low-income household, with a single mother and two young children was a hard thing to handle, but I made it through.   Have you ever had a best friend that you considered to be family in some way? That's all that @CAPS mother had. Unlike myself, her only savior in life was her closest confidant, @PERSON. @CAPS and @CAPS mother had been best friends since before high school - before I was even thought of. @PERSON's always been there for us. @CAPS even stood by @CAPS mother's side when I was born. I'm sure as teenagers, having babies was something outlandish, but a mere two years after @CAPS arrival, @PERSON found herself giving birth to her own beautiful daughter, @PERSON. They've been @CAPS family ever since; @CAPS aunt and cousin. For all of @CAPS childhood, I grew up in one house. Throughout the years that I resided there, @PERSON and her daughter had taken multiple occasions to go on and join us. I used to share a room with @PERSON, and we fought like rivals, but loved like sisters. @CAPS brother was born five years after I and three years after @PERSON. @CAPS was always too small for us to play with, so having other girls in the house was convenient. The both of them served as the family I never had... but it wasn't always such a dandy thing. @PERSON and I did a lot of cruel fighting in our time, but I never once thought that maybe our fights would cause them to leave us. One @DATE @TIME, on a warm and bare day, I awoke to find those people of @CAPS life missing. They had left. A year or so passed by, and we didn't see them around. @PERSON didn't drop by. @CAPS didn't send a letter. It was as if they fell off the face of the @LOCATION. @CAPS heart was hurt, but it soon became healed. Our land-line phone began buzzing off the hook one evening, and to our surprise, @PERSON was on the other line, ""We just moved in. You have to come see our new place."" @CAPS, it was as if nothing between the two adults ever went wrong. When we arrived to visit them in their new adobe, @PERSON took me to one of her friend's houses to climb their shed. I didn't object, I wanted to be friends again... though if I had known what was in store for me, I wouldn't have gone. As we walked from the crime scene and along the mile road, the most you could hear from our direction was @CAPS sobbing. A young boy who didn't seem much older than I turned the corner facing us. When @CAPS saw what a mess I was, @CAPS laughed. ""@CAPS isn't funny!"" I cried. His expression became serious, ""@CAPS, I... what happened?"" @CAPS face was too buried in @CAPS hands for me to speak, so @PERSON took over, ""@CAPS fell through a metal roof!"" The both of us were thinking it, but neither of us said a thing: ""jerk!"" @CAPS turned sympathetic and offered a helping hand, but I turned him away. The further @PERSON and I paced down the stretch of cement, the more tolerable the wounds on @CAPS body became. ""@CAPS,"" glancing over at @PERSON, I smiled, ""@CAPS was really cute,"" I cradled @CAPS face out of embarrassment. @PERSON blushed, agreeing with @CAPS opinion. ""and it sucks because I'm crying, and dirty, and limping, and a huge bloody mess... and the world just always works @CAPS way! Of course I'd run into a cute guy looking like @CAPS!"" @CAPS cousin laughed; @CAPS full on cracked up, amused by me. I didn't quite understand it at the time, but something that stirred up in the situation tickled against @CAPS inner stomach, and I laughed as @CAPS. The two of us spent the rest of the distance laughing about the incident and sharing stories similar to our problem. Looking back on all of @CAPS, I'd like to think that being a young, unintelligent, and naive adolescent brought @CAPS cousin and I back to common grounds, but then I'd be lying. In all honesty, it was our laughter. Even in the most scary and tense situations of the world, laughing for any reason makes a person feel better. Laughing heals feelings, arises thoughts, and brings people together.",15,22,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12644,21202,8,"Warm @CAPS Laughter @MONTH be the best medicine, but it @MONTH also be the best glue. When one laughs, especially with another, it brings a sense of relaxation and happiness. Laughter is a release of amusement, and that literally means ""not thinking"". In this moment, people open themselves up and it brings a warm feeling of the heart that is shared between each other. Without this connection or ability to jest, people begin to think too much and become overly critical about relationships. To flirt is to make fun or light of a situation, the point of this is to put people at ease so they @MONTH open up. Flirting can consist of many things, such as joking, impressing, or complementing; usually this leads to laughing or excessive giggling. When this warming connection begins, so does the bond between the people, such as it was with my own girlfriend. I just came off the back end of a hurtful experience with another girl, so I had become tough at heart. I was a bit of a nervous kid, so when she started to be pleasant and kind to me, I started to grow out of my shell and laugh with her. Our first date was to see some silly yo-yo man who had come to their church. It was a great way to start off what we have been building now for two years, as well as comfortable setting to meet the parents.   Sometimes the key to opening up, or bonding, is to make a fool of oneself. It's hard to laugh with someone who is being prideful or too analytical; laughter is a crucial mental break from routine thinking. Being a dork @MONTH just be the best way to be in a healthy relationship. My relationship is very well balanced between supporting each other, being critical, and being idiots. I take sacrifices to make her laugh, and she does the same for me, but mostly this results in both of us being profusely happy and laughing together. Being a man is not the same as being stubborn or powerful, I feel it's more about being open and compassionate. To be open enough to have someone to laugh with, one has to be able to laugh at themselves. Laughter is an @CAPS, a socially transforming device, and it spreads rapidly.  The same goes for a simple social gathering. Does anyone become the ""life of the party"" without laughing at themselves? They are typically the ones going out of their way to be ridiculous for everyone else to see, because once it starts, it spreads exponentially. Being comfortable is the foundation of having a good time, otherwise people are acting paranoid, refuse to participate, and downright seem cold. Laughter's bright tone is a good way to get people comfortable and relaxed. Think of people as @CAPS. @CAPS is difficult to pour and spread around when it's cold, it's thick and condensed. You can't do much with cold @CAPS, so you have to warm it up. One can't heat @CAPS up in a flash or else it could become tasteless, but once it is gradually heated it becomes easy to spread and very useful. This warm @CAPS is quick to mix with about anything and sticks to things all the same. My relationship has been sticky, sweet, and warming beyond compare, but nothing without a little work, or a little laughter.  ",25,20,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12645,21203,8,"         The @CAPS and Benefits of @CAPS is really an important thing in life. Laughter lightens mood and makes you feel more happy. If people laugh more often their days are more happier, lighter and much more shorter. Little children are the ones who laugh more often. Making adults laugh is not very easy because they are more serious. There are a lot of stories that laughter is the important element. Laughter can connect with many other nice elements, such as being glad or happy. I have once read a story about a little girl named @CAPS who liked to make people glad. And through gladness, people were made to laugh more often. And through laughter, the sick people became healthier and stopped being sick. Laughter consists of many different factors. For example, being glad leads to laughing more, being happy, and of course smiling more. When you are felling down and some stranger for example smiles to you, you feel happier and maybe your mood is going to lighten. The morning dawned to be gray and rainy. The people of the household woke up irritable and grumpy. Everything was going up-side down. No one was smiling. The breakfast was a very monotonous one, because no one felt like talking. It seemed that the day is going to end like this.  @CAPS was also very grumpy this day. She didn't want to go to school at all. She was mad at everyone and everything. She was mad at rain. Rain was her worst enemy because then she couldn't go out for a walk with her friends. She was mad at her maid because she has forgotten to fill her pitcher with warm water, as she always did. She was mad at her little sister for taking her blue hair ribbons. To tell the truth, she was mad at everyone, and she has not even thought that if she had been more happier today, then everything will seem okay. Well, so, she still had to go to school, wanted she or not.  At school, the little teacher was merry as usual. She wasn't a bit grumpy, even if it was a rainy and gloomy day. Some of the student had the same mood as the teacher, but there were very few of them. The school work seemed endless to @CAPS, especially her mathematics. But everything changed after the teacher has told everyone that it was story time. The story was about a little orphan girl who had to go live with her mean relatives. But she wasn't at all affected by their moods. She was very simple and always happy. Over a period of time, the people she was visiting (especially the sick and old) begin to be happy, just like her. And when she had to go away from that village, everyone was sad to see her go. With lightness of heart and being happy, the girl has left the most precious gift, being always happy which led to laughter more often. Even when she was gone, a passing stranger might always hear happiness and laughter. And it was even enjoyable to stay in that place a little while before continuing your journey. Because the passer-by's always felt themselves feeling much better in health, because of laughing. After the teacher has finished the story, @CAPS thought, why wouldn't she try to cheer her family up? Even though it was raining, it didn't mean that everyone should be gloomy. So after the school was finished, @CAPS ran home to cheer everyone up. In the @TIME, when everyone was finished with their day's tasks and relaxing, there was laughter heard through the windows. Seems like @CAPS has found a way to lead laughter into her household too. The story she had heard earlier in the day has helped her today, and all through her long life. She has remembered this special rule of home happiness. And always in her home there was happiness and laughter even on really gloomy and dark days. We can see that this small factor, which doesn't seem to big @CAPS to us has made @CAPS's life more happy. I hope that this little factor can help you too.",19,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12646,21204,8," It was the first day of sophomore year. I had just moved to @LOCATION during the @DATE so I was nervous about the new school just like any kid would be. I walked into the school and checked out @CAPS surroundings. Everything seemed normal enough until I saw it. Near the middle of the sea of tables in the cafeteria was about four tables with around @NUM people at each one, but it wasn'@CAPS the fact that they were there that caught @CAPS attention it was what they were doing. They were dueling with @CAPS-@CAPS-@CAPS cards right there in the middle of the cafeteria where all could see! I was baffled, I mean I used to duel when I was younger in elementary school when the game was newer, but I had to quit cause everyone in @CAPS school stopped dueling, and here I am looking at at least @NUM highschoolers just dueling away. What surprised me most of all was that they were right there in the open where everyone could see, and worst of all judge. I moved to a table nearby them and began to watch a kid named @PERSON (who later has become one of @CAPS best friends.) mop the floor with his opponent. I quickly caught back on to most of the rules, and went home that day thinking ""I'm gonna get back into that game!"". So I bought a deck, and continued @CAPS recon of the tables, @CAPS deck sitting in front of me waiting for someone to challenge it's master. A few days went by as I continued @CAPS silent observation of the duelists. Finally a duelist named @CAPS.J (another one of @CAPS now good friends) challenged me. I accepted and began. He then proceeded to thoroughly kick @CAPS butt in the space of what seemed like five rounds into the game. @PERSON then taught me he how to play better and we became best friends. He is a really funny guy, and to this day I cant hang around him without laughing. Through him I have met tons of great friends.

Laughter can always lighten up the mood no matter what it is, the laughing @MONTH only last a few seconds but that's alright as long as it's there. Maybe you would laugh because somethings funny or just because your tired. My cousin and I laugh for both those reasons every time we are together.  There are many stories I could tell you about laughing with my cousin. @CAPS of the best happened in @ORGANIZATION! We have @CAPS pretty funny time in there. Like just the other day we went into @ORGANIZATION with one of our friends. Our friend went to go get @CAPS candy, and as she left me and my cousin ran way.  As we were running away and hiding or as we call it ""being ninjas"" we couldn't stop laughing the hole time. She tried calling us , and finding us, but we didn't answer or let her see us.

As I was about to finish I had realized I was late for school I was only I @NUM grade so I ran got dressed and told my sisters to @CAPS and get ready but you no how girls can be putting @CAPS there make-@CAPS and doing there hair.      My sister @PERSON was in @NUM grade and my other sister was in @NUM grade our schools were right next to each other so they finally got ready and we were @CAPS our way heading off to school ready for an awesome day with my teacher @PERSONhawk. She wasn't the nicest teacher in the world but I only liked her was because when we were cleaning our desk she gave us shaving cream and me and my friend @PERSON would have so much fun playing in the cream. We began the day with a book and the book was by ""@CAPS foul"" I can't recall the name but I remember the cover was gold an was about ghouls and monsters the way she read it was like if we were there that book was so intense even tho i really didn't understand it. Next she would give us a math worksheet I know right math in @NUM grade but I was really smart at math and she would always pick @CAPS me and give me harder math then others and when I asked her why I was getting harder math then the other kids she had told me I was different. I new I was smarter then some kids but not all so I never knew if that was a complement or an insult but I really didn't care.

At last she finally had noticed me, I was @CAPS walking in an hurried past to get to the car because I had herd my dad yelling ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS""so I was walking faster and faster and as I was walking I herd from a distance a car speeding down the street, but what I hadn't noticed it was it was heading straight for me. The car came flying around the corner nearly hit the cross guard lady, the car had hit the crossing stick the out of no were I was hit flying and rolling down the street. I was hit and bruised cuts every were my dad was panicking ran out of the car screaming at the lady who had hit me and getting her information license plate number.    As I was laying @CAPS the ground my dad came to me and was trying to get me @CAPS he pulled down my pants to see the damage and remember I had my scooby-doo underwear @CAPS and every one was staring at me I was more embarrassed then hurt I didn't feel the pain until the next day so I was all good I couldn't walk so my dad ran put me in the car and every one was laughing at me because they saw my underwear @CAPS and my dad rushed me to the house and then called the ambulance. they told my dad that I would be able to walk again but would have trouble doing sports because i have a fractured hip. i was living the dream my sisters were spoiling me giving me candy and my dad giving me ice cream and @CAPS top of that I couldn't feel the pain. Bu t the fireman said I should be able to go to school the next day and I did and my mean old teacher saw me and i was limping and what she told me got me mad she had told me to ""stop faking it"". I had told my mom that and she got so mad man you would not want to be that teacher so lets say it wasn't pretty.

12649,21207,8," My knees were weak and my hands were slightly shaking as my rapid heartbeat was causing my breathing to increase speed and time. I wanted to get this over with, but at the same time, I hadn't the intentions to ever start a conversation, yet alone, @CAPS him. It had been a whole @DATE since I had seen my dad and I wasn't sure whether to expect a relaxed, laid back man, or an uptight, cranky one. So, I closed my eyes, took deep breaths, and decided to put this in the hands of @CAPS. It was obvious that once I saw my dad, it would be a natural thing to talk to him, but I suspicious of his mood and if it would affect mine at all! If for any reason this did happen for the worse, we probably wouldn't be the best of friends for a matter of weeks. He'd then continue to pull the, ""@CAPS think now that @CAPS're a teenager, @CAPS can do and act however @CAPS want?"" Or the, ""I'm your father, I deserve more respect!"" @CAPS, the funny thing is, I never start any of these things. He chooses to start them when he's bored, I guess. Then, he continues to make me feel bad for his wrongdoings.  When my mother, sister and I arrived at the airport, (I'm not going to lie) I wanted to go home. My sister would crack a few jokes here and there and my mother would let her wittiness shine on me; even in the mist of all of this, they could only get a small giggle out of me because I let my nerves get the best of me. I didn't want my past three months of @DATE to be ruined by his coming home. But once I looked back at all I had done: two weeks in @LOCATION, rafting, etc., I realized that I did miss him and did want him back. Don't get me wrong, my dad is a super nice, funny, and hardworking guy, it's just hard to work with him sometimes.  My dad's flight had landed, and after a solid hour of waiting for him, he came out of the airplane. We could @CAPS his eyes frantically scouring the airport for us, and when he found us, he gave the warmest, friendliest smile I had ever seen upon his face. Tears welded up in his eyes as my sister raced for him and my mom quickly walked behind. My legs carried me toward him and I soon found that my sister and I were competing to be the first to hug him! One hundred feet never felt so close yet so far away. Panting, we reached him with heavy legs and full hearts, now that we were with him.  The good thing is, an awkward moment never appeared. It knocked, but we didn't let it come through the door ; instead laughter came in its place. All of my troubles and worries were gone when he opened his mouth, and those soothing waves of laughter came out and were welcomed into our ears. My heart was lifted and my smile brightened. I knew that my father could not have been gone any longer. I love him! Laughter soothes the soul and brings joy to any situation. It is kind and has no regrets. The only mistake is not taking the chance to laugh in the first place. Laughter is one of the many things that holds me so close to my father today. Our sense of humor when we're together is never dull and is unforgettable. I trust him with my life and ever since I was born, he has found a way to make the best out of every situation by laughter. @CAPS can count on his laugh to make anyone smile and it is without a doubt, the most contagious thing @CAPS'll ever hear.  ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" including me and my father.",21,23,0.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.0,44.0
12650,21208,8," The first day I met her, I knew @CAPS was the right dog for me. Her black and white fur was as soft as cotton, and her eyes as brown as the bark on a tree. @CAPS had a genuine personality no other dog could possess. Which was something I could tell right away @CAPS was the dog for me. Over the next couple of months, our friendship grew, as I taught her to talk, smile, and stand on two legs and dance with me. A black lab @PERSON, instantly became her best friend, as the two ran over the property barking and playing. Everynight the two would cuddle up next to eachother and sleep. The times @CAPS (my new dog) would lay on her side and relax, I would call her an oreo. Her middle belly was white and her sides were black, making her look like a large-breathing oreo @CAPS. @CAPS her name had come from. The seventh month had came along fast, but it was enjoyable every day with my @CAPS at my side.@CAPS gave me the best comfort when I needed it, always giving me a smile when the day was rainy, or sleeping next to me when I didnt feel the best. It was kind of like @CAPS was my own special dose of medicine, her presence made me feel well again. Her love had grown deep into all of our hearts at that house and @CAPS was one of a kind, but something began to change about her as the days went on. Her food bowl would be nearly full everytime we fed her, @CAPS wouldnt run with @PERSON anymore, @CAPS wouldnt talk, and @CAPS wouldnt smile. I knew something was wrong. We didnt know @CAPS was sick until it was too late. The first day @CAPS had thrown up blood. That was when the worrying began between my boyfriend, his mother, and I. We wanted to find a vet to help her, but none of us had the money to do it. The second day in the @TIME, I couldnt find @CAPS anywhere on the property. I thought that maybe @CAPS had just gone for a walk around the outskirts of the house, until it reached @NUM pm and there was still no sign of her. Panick spread throughout my body and I gave up looking for her and turned towards @PERSON. ""@PERSON,"" I looked at her straight into her eyes, ""I know you can hear me."" @CAPS looked at me with big brown eyes and wagged her tail. ""@CAPS is @CAPS, @PERSON?"" I knew @CAPS understood me as @CAPS began to sniff around the areas of the property and suddenly as if @CAPS had picked up a trace, had followed a line of scent to an old opal car. @PERSON wagged her tail looked at me and looked back under the car. There @CAPS was sick looking. So I pulled her back up onto the property for my boyfriends mother to look at her. We werent sure if it was poisoning or something else. So we called a animal expert and asked. @CAPS said it sounded most likely like parvo, since we hadnt gotten @CAPS her parvo shot yet. So over the night to help her feel better, I and my boyfriend stayed up shooting water into her dehydrated body, and spinach juice hoping it would help, but all @CAPS wanted to do was sleep. So we left her alone in peace and decided we would check up on her in the @TIME. In the @TIME my boyfriend had to go to work and I was left alone with @CAPS to take care of her. I sang songs to her as @CAPS layed on the porch sad looking and in despair, I stroked her on her head telling her how much @CAPS was my best friend and my favorite dog that meant so much to me, and I told her I loved her. I tried getting her to eat but @CAPS would only puke it back up. Finally after a day of crying next to her I noticed @CAPS kept walking to the pond behind the house and sitting in it. It gave me the insentive to check her butt. As I pulled up her tail, i noticed a large bloody hole @CAPS flies were flying out of. @CAPS was rotting from the inside out. I cried. It was time to decide whether to put her down or not, and I, my boyfriend, and his father just looked at her watching her be in pain. It was time. As soon as we got to the vet office, they took her inside and layed her on a table @CAPS I was told to hold onto her as they shot an overdose of anasthesia into her. it was only seconds before @CAPS was gone and everyone in the room was silent and I cried over her limp no longer smiling body.  We dug a hole and buried her under the tree @CAPS played under. ""@CAPS my mama bear. @NUM @CAPS @CAPS you in heaven.""",23,18,38.0,38,0.0,0.0,0.0,38.0
12651,21209,8,"Fishing trip gone wrong @CAPS me introduce you to what I will be talking about today, fishing. Fishing has been a big part of @CAPS life ever since I was born. When I was little I used to go out with @CAPS dad and brother to go fishing. @CAPS dad loved to take us to go lake fishing. Ive fished every lake around these parts. When I was five years old I got a brand new @CAPS @CAPS fishing pole it was so shiny and had a great ball bearing spinning reel. It even had some chrome going up the handle so when the sun hit it just right it would shoot a beams of bright light @CAPS the ground. Well as I grew older so did @CAPS fishing pole. The reel didn't turn as well and the chrome didn't shine like it used to.  When I turned @MONEY @CAPS pole was a broken down and just wouldn't work for @CAPS fishing needs anymore. So @CAPS the day of @CAPS tenth birthday @CAPS family and friends gave me a some money. I told them that I wanted to buy a new @CAPS @CAPS fishing pole. So after @CAPS birthday I had acquired one hundred and @MONEY. I thought I was the richest man in the whole wide world. Latter that night @CAPS dad came up to me and told me that @CAPS cousins wedding was this @DATE and that we might have time after to @CAPS a little bit of fishing. I went into the garage and packed @CAPS tackle box with pliers, hooks, spinners and all the fishing gear I would need.  After the @CAPS cousins wedding @CAPS dad said ""@CAPS go fishing."" @CAPS dad and I changed into our fishing clothes and were off but I had remembered that I needed a fishing pole so I asked ""@CAPS dad we need to stop at @ORGANIZATION quickly"". It turned out that there was a @ORGANIZATION @CAPS the way. We pulled into the @ORGANIZATION parking lot and I went in. I ran over to there sporting goods and found the last @CAPS @CAPS fishing pole siting @CAPS the shelf so I got it down and looked it over. This was the pole for me, the only downside was the price that happened to be seventy @MONEY. I bought it anyways. I walked out of the store with @CAPS new @CAPS @CAPS fishing pole feeling like I was a million bucks.  As we arrived at our fishing spot I noticed that we were not at a lake but a large river. @CAPS dad explained that I needed to be safe around the river cause you can get swept away if you fall in. I got out of our car and the wind was harsh. It was chilling to the bone. I took out @CAPS new pole and tackle box and started to setup @CAPS pole for river fishing. I put @CAPS one large weight and big hook. I was ready for anything or at least I thought. I then reached down into @CAPS big red tackle box and pulled out a large worm. ""I think the fish will love this."" I say aloud to @CAPS dad. Staring out at the fast flowing water and toss @CAPS baited fishing line off shore. A big splash of water then ripples, @CAPS dad and I smile with satisfaction. Right next to me was a branch buried within the embankment. Setting @CAPS pole down rather softly I look upon @CAPS dad as he pulls in a fish.  Well @CAPS our walk down to river there was this @CAPS @CAPS outhouse. Me needing to use the restroom, I turned to @CAPS right and said to @CAPS dad ""@CAPS not lose @CAPS fishing pole, I don't want it to going flying into the river if I get a big fish @CAPS."" @CAPS dad reply's ""@CAPS, @CAPS just go to the bathroom already."" @CAPS @CAPS walk to the bathroom I didn't see the big @CAPS that had landed near @CAPS fishing line. @CAPS dad saw them getting closer and closer to @CAPS line so he thought it would be a good idea to scare them away. As soon as I walk out of the bathroom @CAPS dad goes running and waving his arms at the @CAPS. They all take off into the air, but something was trailing behind one of them weighing it down. What was it you @MONTH ask? It was @CAPS brand new fishing pole! It was at least @NUM maybe @NUM feet in the air. As soon as @CAPS pole took off flying it started falling. It didn't land @CAPS shore but it landed in the middle of this big wide river. @CAPS dad looks at me and says with a smile ""That's the first fishing pole that I've ever seen fly."" I start laughing uncontrollably then @CAPS dad starts cracking up. After the laughter was done @CAPS dad looked @CAPS shore for something to pull @CAPS pole in with but to @CAPS surprise he found it @CAPS shore down river.Will @CAPS",20,22,0.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0
12652,21210,8," @DATE my birthday, my boyfriend @PERSON took me to @LOCATION to @ORGANIZATION's. I had never been there it was exciting and a new food experience for me. My dad had promised me that he would take me because it was my @NUM birthday and he wasn't there for my @NUM birthday. But he forgot so my dads girlfriend called the restaurant and told the manager that it was my birthday and to give me anything that i wanted and just to charge it on her credit card. This is where mine and @PERSON's adventure started..  The beging of our adventure. Driving on the old back roads of @CAPS in the old @ORGANIZATION on our way to @LOCATION. Just @PERSON and I, the roads were damp with the mid-afternoon dew, the trees with their beautiful leaves of all different color's of red's, green's, and orange. Bouncing around from the dips in the old road. @NUM bumpin on the stereo, only singing the parts we know. When we got to @CAPS we got lost because we took the wrong exit and ended up in @LOCATION the other side of where we were supposed to be. Being lost in a way bigger city than @PERSON or @CAPS wasn't good, We had no clue where we were.  First place we go to was a strip mall that had a big party store. we go inside and theirs @CAPS decorations as far as the eye could see. Monster's, whitche's, and goblin's. We got side tracked by all the scary things I realized that I had to go to the bathroom. While I went to the bathroom @PERSON asked one of the store clerks where we could find this @CAPS. The guy tells us hes never heard of a place like that. So we got back into the @ORGANIZATION, there was a lady getting out of her car so we asked her. She said yeah its just down a couple of streets. As we drive down the highway we couldn't find it anywhere. Somehow we are lost all over again so we find another covenant store up this really big hill. we didn't think that the little @ORGANIZATION could make it up such a big hill. We made it to the top, went inside and had the clerk look up on his phone were we needed to go. As we waited all I could think about was how bad my feet were hurting in those shoes. We got the address and took off again for our search.   About twenty minutes later we still had no luck at finding this restaurant and to top it off we had a reservation so we couldn't be late. We find another covenant store and @PERSON ran in to ask. The clerk told us to get back on the highway I was like no no stay on this road. We followed the empty road and right around the corner there it was @CAPS. We were happy to have found it finally and we weren't even late. All @PERSON and I could do was laugh because we had gotten so frustrated to find the stupid place that it was just so funny you couldn't help but not to laugh. It brought @PERSON and I just that much closer we had gotten through that by laughing instead of fighting. And that we our funny adventure story. ",18,17,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12653,21211,8,"Ever since I was born laughter has been a big part of my life without it I would be a very boring and grumpy person. Even tough I have experienced many moments full of laughter one specific moment always comes to mind. About a year ago my mom and I went on a trip down to @LOCATION to visit her family. It was the first time we had been there in over twelve years because my mom and I could not go visit them do to immigration problems. After all toughs years had past by my mom and I managed to get our legal residency in the united states. As soon as we got the residency we were free and could go visit her family without having to come back illegally. When my mom and I got to the airport in @LOCATION my mom started crying because she was full of emotions, for the first time in twelve years she was going to see her mom, dad, brothers, and sisters. As soon as we had gone trough all the airport security and baggage claim we made our way out to the exit where my grandpa had agreed to pick us up. When we got outside the airport a small little red @ORGANIZATION started getting closer and closer driving towards my mom and I. The car was no further then forty feet away when my mom suddenly dropped her luggage and started running toward the small red car I had no idea who the elderly person driving the car was. When the car parked an aged man stepped out of the vehicle and gave my mom one of the longest and most emotional hugs I had ever experienced in my entire life they must of been hugging for at least fifteen minutes just crying on each-others shoulders. When they had finished hugging my mom calls out my name and I start walking toward her. When I was face to face with my mom and the older man my mom tells me that the man was my grandfather then she looks at her dad and tells him to meet his grandson. For the first time in a very long time I had a grandfather I stood in shock for a while and so did he. He was amazed of how big and how much I had changed in toughs long twelve years that he had gone without seeing me or having contact with me. When I reached out to hug him he griped me hard and didn't let go he told me that this day had been the happiest day of his life.  Me and my grandpa started loading the luggage into his car so we could head home to meet the rest of my family. When we got done loading everything into the car we headed home. The long ride home was a bit weird and uncomfortable because there wasn't much talk in the car. It was about a fifty minute ride home when we reached our destination in a small little town out of the @LOCATION called texcoco. It was a nice little clean town with a lot of small stores and lots of two story middle class houses the streets full of cars and people walking or on bicycles very different to what I was used to back in the united states. When we got to our house there was a group of about twenty people that were family and friends outside the gate waiting for us. When we were done seedling in and got done meeting all our relatives we got together and had a family dinner. One of my uncles really stood out because he was really funny and always was acting like a clown he was the one that set the mood in the house or wherever he went. As days past by I was getting more and more comfortable with the people around me and started having fun. About two weeks past and my uncle @CAPS invited me to one of his stand up comedy shows. that day I experienced more laughter then ever before his jokes where original and true.In cunclusion laughter is one of the elements to life without I could not be happy.",17,16,0.0,33,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.0
12654,21213,8," Its my sophomore year and some of my friends were going to try out softball. After thinking about it I joined and I fell in love with this sport. I am not that good but like they say practice makes perfect. We all laugh and have a good time and everyone likes everyone and its fun to be apart of a team that is always laughing and having a great time together. This is about a time when my friends and I started laughing so hard we almost started cried and now its one of our little joke between all of us girls. Once my friends and I were out catching pop fly's and it was my turn to go catch the ball. I went out there skipping and just being my normal weird self. They hit the ball and it started to come toward me and I went running for it and slipped and fell right on my butt. Everyone including me started laugh because I fell in the mud and got all dirty. About ten minutes later we all were standing there and talking about how funny it was when I fell and how it made everyone's day. Then I saw some mud on the ground and I wanted to roll in it but didn't want to just lay down and start rolling in mud. So I asked my friend @PERSON to push me into the mud so I could fall in and roll in it. After she pushed me into the mud I got up and started laughing my head off. My knees were covered in mud and so was my butt and legs. They all started to say who shied on you because we are not aloud to curse, so we made something else to replace it. Now when I walk in the hall ways and see someone from the softball team we both just start laughing and say who shied on you in the middle of what ever we are doing right then.  This is the first year I have ever played a sport in high school and I am glad I did it because I am having so much fun. When it ends in a few months I am going to be really upset. All these girls and I have became so close in the last @NUM weeks that they are like family to me now. Most of us use to just know each other and not really were friends and never talked at all but now we all do. We love to do silly things like sing in the locker room randomly or make the most dumbest jokes ever. But we all have fun and we don't care. We have had lots of laughs and many more to come this season. Like when we have games on the buses or just even at practice. We have an amazing couch that makes us laugh and makes jokes everyday. This season should be interesting with all of us because we all like to laugh and make joke and sing and just have a great time with each other and that's all that matters to make a good softball team and a great season.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12655,21214,8,"The Benefits of Laughter Laughter has always been a major part of my life. Most of the relationships that I have with my friends are great , because i can make them laugh and cheer them up when they feel down. When a person laughs it makes them completely forget about anything that brought them down, and now they just focus on what made them laugh and feel that joy and happiness. When you laugh , the only thing on your mind is the thing that made you laugh, nothing else. laughter in many cases has brought people from an absolute low self-esteem to a high self-esteem in a very short amount of time. An example in where laughter was very beneficial to a person happened with one of my friends. One of my good friends seemed to be really down and didn't want to talk about what was going on with anyone. With him not telling anyone what was wrong it kind of leaves you guessing, what could have happened? After about a week of pretty much isolating himself from others, he was ready to talk and hang out with some of his close friends, which included me. Me, and two other people that were friends with me and him, decided to go golfing which was a new hobby of ours. It was that day that he told us how his mom was cheating on his dad for over a year, and how she was also hiding alcohol in all different kinds of places. and was over-drinking.  By him just being around his friends, laughing and having a good time, he found himself focusing on other things other than what was going wrong in his life. Even laughing at yourself can be a good way of coping with your problems. even when there seems that nothing will go right in your life, something always will, you just have to give it time. The moral of the story that i have just told is that no matter how sad you feel, laughter can always help ease the pain. Even laughing about a bad situation could help you to feel better.

12656,21215,8," Laughter is huge part of everyone's life. It's used to express several different emotions. It's used to bridge the gap between people and break the awkward barrier. People laugh at their own mistakes which show others that they too make mistakes.  Some people can communicate through laughter and know what the other is feeling. For instance one time while i was on a long car ride and very bored and about to fall asleep. So out of no where I began laughing with my friend and laughing different ways and carried on a whole conversation just with laughter. Laughing can bring others together by sharing common interests; everyone laughs. I laugh more than others I'm sure of it. Laughter is a huge part of my life, honestly with out it my life would be boring and depressing. I laugh so much sometimes that my side and stomach hurts so bad. I also make a lot of mistakes and am very clumsy so i get laughed at a lot. My family is a very close and hilarious family we make a lot of mistakes constantly everyday. For my great grandma's @DATE we were planning a surprise party. While we were planning it my grandma kept getting suspicious and asking what we were doing. So we kept telling her that we were going to get her a stripper for her @DATE. So we managed to talk my uncle bobby into being a stripper and climbing out of a box and so he did and it ended up scaring my grandma. Until this day we still talk about that day and laugh about it all the time. Everyday my aunt acts in a ridiculous and funny way and so most of the time i laugh at her. She is always dancing at music on commercials or singing opera. My great grandma always eats foods that make her pass gas, and it's hilarious because sometimes she doesn't even realize that she is doing it. My great grandma also likes to dance and it also hilarious because the dance moves that she knows are far different then the ones today. I believe that with out laughter my family would not be as close as we are. With out laughter i would not be as close to my friends. You can bond over laughter it sometimes forces you to ask questions and get to know people in other ways you would not. It makes you comfortable around people and able to share things and act silly and not worry about your appearance. Laughter can also change your emotion from mad to happy in an instance. For example i was riding dirt bikes with my younger cousin and he decided that he wanted to go through this swamp with his bike. I told him it wasn't very wise because i knew it was not possible for him to go through there with out getting stuck and yet he tried it anyway. So as i assumed he got the bike stuck and since i was the only one with him i had to help him get the bike unstuck. It took forever for us to get the bike out. As soon as we did he tried to drive through again and got it stuck yet another time. I was very upset with my cousin but as i was getting ready to yell and leave him he fell in the mud head first and it instantly changed my mood. Even still today i laugh about the matter even though i didn't think it was very funny at the time.  Even though laughter is good it can also be bad; @CAPS laughing at others while they are hurt and crying, or laughing at stupid ignorant pranks, or even laughing at people while they are making bad decisions. Decisions @CAPS drinking, drunk people are funny but the fact of being drunk or drinking at all is not. You can actually influence people to make bad decisions by laughing at them. Laughing at them makes them think that it's @CAPS to do what they are doing because it is making others laugh. So laughter is healthy but it is also unhealthy in a way.",21,20,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0
12657,21217,8,"So my friends and i got into a heated discusion on how we need to keep things to our selves cause one of my friends told people some personal things about us. He caused us allot of problems in school and around town, @CAPS he started to lie to us one of my other friends lost it and went after him and tackled him down told him to quite lying. By the time he let him up and we all got back in are seats he started to spill his guts to us, he told us some rumers he started about us and some other things he did we kinda all lost it. So we calmed down a little then took turns talking to him, after my two friends talked it was my turn i was talking to him and he kept interupting me, finally i got mad and i grabed something off the floor to throw at him. Don't git me wrong not to hurt im to stop him from interupting me. I reached down grabed something soft without looking picked it up and threatened to throw it at him and he started to point and laugh, I stoped turned my head to look at what was in my hand. now remember it was an intense conversation you could cut the tension with a nife, for him to start laughing and everyone join in i didnt want to know. But i turned my head looked and fell over laughing it was a stuffed fairy i picked up off his floor i did through it at him, but playfully. We all finally stoped laughing and sat back down. I believe that it calmed us down enough to help exsplain and make things better for him and all of us. the moral of the story is even though your mad something will always make you smile and make your day better .",11,16,30.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12658,21218,8," Every fiber of my being was urging me to talk to her, but my gut churned with anxiety every time I gathered up the courage to do @CAPS. Then she glanced at me. Just for a second, but enough to gather information about me. Enough to tell that I wasn't just looking around the room vacantly, but I was focusing on her dark brown eyes, and hers only. I sheepishly flickered my eyes away, quickly counseling myself, why did you keep looking at her? You knew that she was going to notice! But somehow I knew I wanted her to. I wanted her to look back at me. I didn't feeling her gaze upon me anymore, even though it was only a second before that we made eye contact. I darted my eyes in her direction again. This time she was looking at me first and I fell into her sight. I didn't know what to do about this, I haven't been in this situation before. @CAPS girl has ever beaten me to first glance. She smiled, a cute little smile, I've noticed you noticing me, I don't see why you need to hide it. I have my eye on you. All I could do was focus on not looking like a moron. I willed myself to smile, but only slightly, enough to let her know i saw her smile, and it was at me! There was @PERSON, smiling at me, giving me a chance to show her what makes me a guy for her. Then @DATE came. The ice rink in @LOCATION was about @NUM minutes away, which seemed short because of the @NUM friends that were howling and talking crap about each other in the back. We drove up and parked next to the rink. As we stepped out of my mom's minivan we could all hear the hustle and bustle of kids strapping on their rental skates and awkwardly walking towards the thick glass doors that lead to the oval arena of dry frigid air accompanied by a thick bed of cut up ice.Our group of friends all traded in our money and received our own pair of worn, probably never cleaned, ice skates. Absently we slide on the uncomfortable bladed shoes and waddled for the glass doors. One-by-one each of us stepped cautiously on to the ice, making sure we didn't look silly by sliding forward and performing the splits in front of everyone around us. When we finally conquered that challenge we proceeded to slide our way along with the current of skaters flowing in the counterclockwise loop around the rink. Every once in a while we'd race each other for a lap around the rink, but besides that we just talked about @CAPS of @CAPS: @CAPS @CAPS and the various other games that held our interest.  But as usual that conversation turned into a debate about ""over powered classes"". One side complaining that they can never win against that class, the other saying that it's very easy to ""destroy"" them with a simple trick. I proceeded to daze off out of the fight, looking around the rink, watching people stumble along their path or glide gracefully through the awkwardly skating participants. Then I saw her again. Her hair was the first thing that caught my eye, it acting as a blanket would being hung on a clothes line out in a @DATE's breeze. Then as she looping around the end of the rink her face started to be revealed, just as beautiful as before.  She wasn't having the hardest time skating, but every once in a while she would slide a skate too far to one side, lose her balance, but was able to regain her composure within a second or two. I smiled as she looked around, checking if anyone had seen her little mishap. ""@CAPS the sniper is @CAPS @LOCATION, you don't know what you're talking about!""my friends sneered at one another. I had @CAPS interest in being pulled into this argument. As I sped up away from my friends, and weaved my way through the crowd, I eased my way towards @PERSON. As i approached her I was running one-liners through my head to use as an icebreaker with her.  I noticed her feet slide outwards on both sides of her, and I smiled at what I could do to be able to engage her. As she began to stumble, I had to time my entry perfectly as to seem like a random bystander just there to help her back up, rather than an anxious boy trying to find a way to talk to her. Right when she was about to fall over I sped up and placed my hand on her back and gave her a little push upwards. But she was too far gone. She tumbled on top of me as we fell to the hard ice. As the commotion seized, she quickly jumped off and apologized for her clumsiness. But all she noticed was my hysterical laughing. All she could do was laugh along.",22,20,0.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0
12659,21219,8,"                  Laughter I have many friends. My friends and I are always doing silly things to have a good time, and pass the time. We are laughing all the time. There is not one day where we are together and we do not laugh. My friends and I believe that laughter is an essential element of life. One, blazing, @DATE day my friends, @PERSON, @LOCATION, @PERSON, @LOCATION, and @PERSON , all came over to my house. We were all bored, and hot, so we wanted to decide on something exciting to do. @LOCATION said, ""@CAPS don't we go swimming you guy's?"" We all agreed. My friends and I could not agree on where to go swimming though. We couldn't go to the pool near my house, because it was to crowded. We also, could not go to the lake, because it was too far, and we had no way to get there. My mother was working, so she could not give us a ride. @CAPS then said, ""I know you guy's! @CAPS don't we just have a water balloon fight right here at @CAPS's house?"" We all responded, ""@CAPS let's do it!"" A little after, the @CAPS went to the store nearest by, which was @ORGANIZATION, to buy water balloons, and water guns. Once they got back, they started filling them up right away. While us ladies changed into our bathing suits. After, we all decided on who was going to be on what team. The first team was @PERSON, @PERSON, and @LOCATION. The second team, and the best team, was @LOCATION, @PERSON, and I. Both teams were all ready to go. Each team had buckets full of water balloons, and water guns. The teams were on different sides of my mom's green suburban. We were going to start throwing water balloons at the count of three, but the opposite team cheated and threw a water balloon before. Oh, but they did not realize that we had the hose on our side. @PERSON chased @PERSON across the yard. She caught up to her and soaked her with her water gun, but @PERSON threw a huge water balloon at her. It exploded right on her face. We all started laughing. Then, @PERSON and I started throwing water balloons at each other. We ran out, so we started using our water guns. Those too eventually ran out. @PERSON was all out of resources. I grabbed the hose, and I turned it up to full power. @PERSON tried to run but he slipped and fell. I completely hosed him down. My team had won the first @CAPS. It was time for @CAPS two now. We had filled up more water balloons, refilled our water guns, and gone to our sides. We all counted, ""One! Two! Three!"" @CAPS two had started. @LOCATION started chasing @PERSON. They went around the suburban at least five times before he caught up to her. He caught up to her on the grass. The grass was really slippery from when I got @CAPS wet, so they slipped, and fell down. @PERSON slipped first, but she took @LOCATION down with her when she was trying to get back up. We all started throwing water balloons at them, which made it harder for them to get up. @PERSON managed to get up she went on the side where her team was. They started throwing everything they had at us. They soaked us up. We had lost the second @CAPS. Now it was time for the final @CAPS. The @CAPS that decided who won, and who lost. We filled up double the water balloons, and double the water guns. No one got the hose that time. We thought it was not fair. Both teams lined up on different sides of my front yard. My team was on the right side, and the opposite team was on the left side. We were against who ever was lined up in front of us. I threw the first water balloon at @LOCATION. Then @LOCATION threw at @PERSON, and after @PERSON at @LOCATION. Who ever moved out of line lost. @PERSON was the first to lose. @PERSON had thrown a big water balloon at her that knocked her out of line. We moved a step closer. It was now three against two. @LOCATION then water gunned @CAPS down. We walked another step closer. @PERSON and I were going back and forth at each other, but @PERSON had no more water balloons after a while and her water gun was empty so I beat her. We moved another step closer. @LOCATION, and I easily soaked @PERSON down. My team had had won! We all cheered, then went back inside to dry off, and have some ice cream to celebrate my teams success. That day we proved that anyone can have a great time with some good friends, imagination, and a lot of laughter. I believe that everyone should laugh on regular basis. There is no need for sadness of anger in life.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12660,21220,8," Well it all started with the day he came to the airport. Missing him so much hardly ever getting to see him or have him return your phone calls like a @CAPS brother should, but it is always a blessing t see him and have him over for the holidays its amazing how he found time during the @DATE to come and visit us. it was well fortunate because now i didn't have to hear him cry all the time on its too cold and wet out here. So it was pretty good but because it was the @DATE it was normally about the time i go out and hang out with my friends and girls and now that started talking to this really beautiful girl that lives right around the corner from my house i was dying to go out and be with her but since time was really short with him i had to put my @CAPS brother first before anything.But then again every chance i got man i left and sneaked away to go see her. she was so beautiful so funny man she was s perfect to me it was crazy like a dream. I would tell my brother all the time about her. He would always tell me even if she was real it was impossible for a girl to be like that. It was the first day he spent the night everybody was so happy in the house from the time we picked up from the airport to the drive home talking making jokes about how much he changed how tight his cloths are. It was good we even stopped at burger-vile to get a couple burgers cause fat boy was so hungry all the time non stop eating. We shortly arrived home and the look on my little brother and sisters face was priceless there mouths open so wide like if they just saw god. As they came running towards he wasn't so prepared for it slowly still putting his bags down by the door he gets tackled and ruined over by a @NUM year old girl and a @NUM year old boy it was funny seeing them so happy and excited it was a surprise for them we were only supposed to get gas ha ha ha. Then after we sat down and talked all night when we rented movies earlier that day to watch, as a family but like my family nothing ever happens accordingly or on time. You know when your having fun and laughing you don't want it to end and you forget about everything let time go by and keep on doing what you do. But as time catch's up to you ad running on low energy because you been excited all day to see your @CAPS brother and to share story's tell jokes and laugh having a good time you get sleepy and in some real need of some rest like sleep in your bed in the covers and with the lights off, in silence. Oh good times having pleasant dreams of food and girls. Most of the time there put together in one hole dream after dream ha ha ha. Then we woke up had a great time shared some laughs in the morning cracking joke nonstop. Talking hanging out i got to take my @CAPS brother to some party's of mine which really scared my parents but it was funny at the same time cause before we left my mom was like okay we letting you g out don't get yourself into any shit @CAPS don't alright your dads going to b picking you up so don't be acting stupid look after your brother okay and right after i said yeah alright bet. i questioned it and was like what the hell? why do i have to look after my @CAPS brother he should be looking out for me. but i guess that's what made it funny. ever since then we had a good time and that's where this story ends with me saying goodbye at the airport to him. hoping that one day soon ill see him again soon.",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12661,21221,8," My Laughter Story @CAPS you know that laughing really adds time to your life? Well you do now. Laughter is a great thing to have, because without laughter our world would be dull and pointless. On a day to day basis you should laugh everyday. Laughing can really help you get through a tough time.Me, @PERSON, @PERSON, and @PERSON were just hanging out up at @ORGANIZATION's house one day and @PERSON was being really funny, all of us were laughing hysterically at what @PERSON was saying, then suddenly @PERSON calls us and wants to hangout and for us to come to @LOCATION, but she said only @NUM of us can go. So we all debated on who was going to go. We came to a decision and @PERSON was the one having to stay back, but @PERSON gave him something to keep him occupied. So @PERSON, @PERSON, and I were mobbing the bus to @LOCATION @LOCATION. There was a tweaker on the bus and he was making us laugh so hard, but he wasn't even trying. So we arrived at @ORGANIZATION. We were all hungry so we decided to get some @ORGANIZATION. When we got to @ORGANIZATION we all just got a dollar burger which were rip offs so we all saved our pickles that were on the burger so when we left we could stick them on the windows. We @CAPS and it made us laugh so hard we could barley run away. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION's apartment we knocked on her door, no one answered, so we knocked again, no answer again. We were just about to call her when she walks out of a different apartment and we all just started laughing because we pounded on someone elses door. When we walked in there was a party going on so we were like nice. When we got there we all had a couple of beers. We were having such a good time we were all just laughing and have the greatest time. That next morning we woke up at @NUM a.m because we had to ride the bus back to @LOCATION early because it was @DATE and the buses run only for a little bit. When we got on the bus the bus driver was making weird faces like he was constipated or something but he made me laugh really hard.When we arrived back in @LOCATION we called up @PERSON to see what he was doing, he was just hanging out in town so we just went and kicked it with him for the rest of the day and later we all went home.

12662,21222,8," laughter is the best medicine,well that is what some people say. I think that laughter is good for you and if you are in a relationship laughing is really good for that. @CAPS here are some of the ways laughing is good for you. laughing in a relationship is good because if you can't laugh together you probably not be together. If you can't laugh with your boyfriend/girlfriend you will not have a very good relationship with him/her. @CAPS don't be scared to laugh a little with your boyfriend or girlfriend. I think and I think most people will say the same thing to that if you want a good relationship you need to laugh.laughing is good when you are sad because you can get told a joke and if it is a good joke it can make you feel better.It works at school to you laugh with your friends and all your stress will go away.if we all just laugh about more things and not take things @CAPS sonorously we would not have @CAPS many bad stuff happen in the world. we will all get along better and not get in fights in school,wouldn't have @CAPS many people in jail or person,   @CAPS that is why i think laughter is the best medicine for people who are sad,stress,and in relationship.

12663,21223,8," Have you ever laughed so hard that you started crying? Were you alone? Most of the time when you are laughing about something you are with someone else. I believe that laughter brings two people closer because it's something you guys both share, a moment you and that other person can think of and picture over and over again in the future. Even if that person is miles away. I can remember it as if it just happened a couple weeks ago. I had just finished a conversation with @CAPS mom. I went into @CAPS room and unplugged @CAPS little black phone from the charger. I opened it and a blinking light flickered saying ""@NUM missed calls from @PERSON."" I called her back to apologize for missing her phone call. I heard someone pick up, but nobody talked on the other end. "" @CAPS, @PERSON you there?"" I had asked hoping I would get a reply out of her. I sure got a reply just not the one I was wanting. She started bawling. Trying to catch her breathe, the words barely escaping her mouth. ""@CAPS, @CAPS grandpa just died.""  @CAPS heart sank into @CAPS stomach. @CAPS eyes started to water up and @CAPS throat started to close, making it harder to breathe. @CAPS voice was all shaky and rough. I said, ""I'm sorry @PERSON."" and I started crying. Us both crying wasn't make anything better anytime soon. She then had explained that he had a heart attack and asked me how something could happen to someone that didn't deserve it. I didn't have an answer to give her though. I had never been in the position she was in. Who was I to know what to say, or do to help her? So I thought hard of what to say to her that would clear her mind a little bit. @CAPS brain started hurting when I finally found something from the heart to tell her, something I would want to hear if @CAPS grandpa passed away.  I said in a low calming voice, ""there isn't much I can tell you because I don't know from experience, but you're family needs you right now as much as you need them. Think about the good times you had with you're grandpa @CAPS. The laughs you guys enjoyed together. I heard a slight giggle underneath her sniffling. She started telling me a story about how every year her family would take a weekend beach trip. How it was a time for her family to bond and how she would miss it. When she told me that story @CAPS heart warmed and the corners of @CAPS mouth went up a little. I was proud of myself for sticking in there and being strong for @CAPS friend. Even though @PERSON will never see her grandpa @CAPS again she will always have him with her. Through memories, with in her heart, and by laughter.",20,18,36.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12664,21224,8," Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. The sound of laughter is as unique as the sound of crying. There are many things that can cause people to laugh. And once you start laughing, you can't stop. Laughter is caused by something that is humorous, so it's mostly the cause of laughter that makes it so much more fun. And it usually depends on who you are with, where you are, and in what kind of situation you're in before you can actually start laughing. Kind of like the time when I was in @LOCATION baking a pie with my @CAPS @CAPS.....  It was a nice warm evening in @LOCATION, and I was making a pie with my @CAPS @CAPS. We had out all the ingredients necessary to make the pie until my @CAPS points out there's no more sugar. She tells me to go to the covers and grab a jar of sugar. So I went, and there were two jars when I opened the covers I asked her which of the two jars is the sugar because they had no lables on them. ""I think its the the jar on the left"", she said. I grab the jar on the left side without another word.  Later on while everyone was sitting down talking with one another, my @CAPS and I go and get the pie to serve to the family. They all looked at the pie in awe as we took it out and started slicing it. After everyone was served they all took a bite out of it. Imidiately in just seconds everybody starts spitting it out like it was the worst thing that they have ever put in there mouths'. Suddenly my @LOCATION makes a comment saying that the pie is too salty..... not exactly the kind of comment I was expecting. Then my @CAPS @CAPS goes and checks to see the jar that I had grabbed from the covers. She sticks her finger in the jar and tastes it. Luckily enough, it was the salt jar. Then out of no where everyone starts to laugh into tears at the thought of what just happened. It was the most fun I had that evening, nobody could stop laughing. Clearly, the situation with the pie was something that I will surely never forget, and it'll probably never happen again. And after all that happend with the pie ended up being the kind of situation that makes you laugh. This shows that the three causes of laughter is real. First, I was with my @CAPS. Secondly, I was in my @LOCATION's house where there has to be at least one funny thing that can happen there. And also what happened with the salt and the sugar was a completely unexpected situation that turned out to be unmistakeably hilarious. And to think that this event happened all because of the three main causes of laughter. Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. Laughter will always be one of those things in life that cannot ever be destroyed. If you are a person who says that they've never laughed, then you are a liar and a hypocrite. Being able to laugh is good for you and your health. It gives you extra oxygen in your lungs to help you breathe easier and it's a lot of fun. So if you ever notice that you haven't laughed, stop imidiately and take the time to have a laugh.  ",20,23,0.0,43,0.0,0.0,0.0,43.0
12665,21225,8," Laughter--as we all know @CAPS--is a visual expression of happiness, or in inward feeling of joy. @CAPS @MONTH insure from telling a joke, being tickled, or from some other random stimuli. @CAPS is in most cases, a very pleasant sensation. By that means, laughing has an enormous impact on each and every one of us throughout our everyday lives. Laughter tends to enlighten our emotions by expressing them in many good, cheerful, and lastly, positive ways. However, @CAPS is proven that laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze.When laughter is shared, @CAPS binds people together and increases the intimacy and happiness. Around @TIME--which happens to be exactly when my third period class begins, I was supposed to be in my @CAPS class at the time, but with my luck--I wasn't. You are probably thinking, ""@CAPS, if she is not in her third period class, then where is she?"" I actually ended up in the computer lab, beginning my state writing test once again. I defiantly wasn't too thrilled about taking the writing test over again, but in my heart, I knew deep down inside that I could pass the state writing test this time without any if, and, or buts, which are also known as the worst things ever--excuses. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was going to walk out of the room, realizing that I could of done better--that's for sure. My self confidence was set to an exceedingly high standard with absolutely no negatives thoughts to think of. I was ready to face the test--once again. As soon as I entered the computer lab, I almost nearly sat down as fast as a fly trying to dodge a fly swatter. I took an immense deep breath--like usual, and began to log into the computer. In between the time I was waiting for my computer to get logged in, I sat there gazing around the room, with nothing more to do, then to visualize what I was going to type my state writing test about. Once the teacher approved my log-in, I started typing all of my private information into the blank squares, so that I could begin my next steps.Within seconds I was ready to begin my test. On the screen appeared several topics that were listed below to choose from, but there was only one of them that I felt most satisfied with, and that I felt I could score exceedingly high in. The topic was, ""We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was on element or part.""  The minute I selected that subject, I honestly had no idea what I was going to write about because during my childhood life I had numerous laughter moments that had occurred, and nearly every story that I could remember had to of been more than @NUM words. So, I quietly sat there thinking-- just how I knew I would be.  During the moment, I heard this very irritating sound, which was the from the many taps from the kid's keyboards, and numerous annoying clicks from the computer mouses. @CAPS was very obvious that the students understood their topic quite @CAPS--unlike me.  Minutes had flew by so quickly, and yet, still nothing. Not a single story to share about laughter. By then, I was very upset with myself, because if you really think about @CAPS, who does not have a story to write about that deals with laughter? I knew I had some sort or kind of story to share, @CAPS was just harder for me to summarize one up and type about @CAPS.  Just then, as I was going to begin my essay, a younger student, (that had been taking a state reading test), loudly shouted, ""@CAPS!"" The little kid not only caught myself, but the rest of the class as @CAPS. I honestly swear @CAPS was a ""had to of been there moments."" @CAPS wasn't just for the fact that he said @CAPS exceedingly loud, but the expression that was on his face, and the way he announced @CAPS to everyone in the computer lab--@CAPS nearly killed me inside. The little boy was so thrilled and proud of himself that he had passed. Obviously he was very eager to let the entire class know--which is probably something I would have done as @CAPS.  Almost as quickly as he announced @CAPS, I knew this was a laughing moment to not only remember, but to share with others as @CAPS. In fact, if truth be told, this short story just so happened to not only make my day, but he had made my state writing assessment topic many times less stressing for me. Clearly as you can see, laughing indeed does seem to have an enormous impact on each and everyone of us throughout our everyday lives, and sometimes those moments are meant to be shared.",25,25,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0
12666,21227,8," For me there are so many parts in my life that involve laughter. Having fun and laughing are the main things that I do in my life. When I laugh I feel happy, so whenever I'm sad or mad people can always tell a joke or something to make me giggle and then I'm happy again. I love making people laugh. Sometimes when I try and make people laugh I tell a joke but I'm not that funny. When I just be myself, people laugh. I guess I can be funny without even trying.  I have amazing friends, I mean absolutely amazing, although we have our rough days I still love them and thank @CAPS for them everyday. My friends and I are always cooking up some way to have fun, and every time we find something to do @CAPS always turns out to be funny. Even the little things, such as facial expressions, the way we pronounce a word, or even the way we eat our food makes us laugh. @CAPS's actually pretty ridiculous. When my friends and I try to tell other people about our extremely hilarious adventures, they all just stare at us as we burst into laughter. @CAPS's possible that people don't think @CAPS's funny because they weren't there.   This year my family has an exchange student named, @PERSON. She is from @LOCATION. She is very shy and quiet. @PERSON never seemed like the type to make me laugh, @CAPS boy was I wrong. She is possibly the funniest thing to walk the @LOCATION. I sure think she's funny, anyway. Sometimes she is so oblivious that @CAPS is just hard not to laugh at her. I have a best friend named @PERSON. We have so many fun memories together. She is amazing and funny. She is so short, people call her a midget, she is quick to reply, ""I am not a midget! I am @NUM' @NUM'', you have to be @NUM' @NUM'' to be a midget!"" @CAPS is so cute when she does this.  I recently moved back from living with my grandparents in @LOCATION. While I was living there I had been informed (over the phone I might add) that there was a girl living in my old bedroom. ""@CAPS's a foreign exchange student from @LOCATION,"" my family told me. I flew back up to @LOCATION for @CAPS with my family. When I got here I met @PERSON. She seemed so quiet and sweet. @CAPS was late when we got home so I immediately went to sleep. The next day I woke up, called my grandma, then called @PERSON and asked her to come over and hang out with me. She came and met @PERSON. @PERSON told us she wanted to get my mom a birthday gift and I replied, ""@CAPS, that's tomorrow, lets go into town."" All three of us went to town and went to @ORGANIZATION For @CAPS. When we got there we all looked around for something we thought she might like. Somehow, we ended up in the underwear aisle. @PERSON picked out a tiny sized pair of underwear and shouted, ""@CAPS @PERSON, what about these?"" @PERSON looked at her with the funniest facial expression and shouted back,""@CAPS, I don't think my thighs would fit through that!"" @PERSON and I literally fell onto the floor and laughed so hard that our faces were bright red. Based on our first impression, we thought she was a quiet, ""keep to herself"" kind of girl so we just thought @CAPS was hilarious. We tease @PERSON about this quite often and she teases back about other funny things we've encountered. I've grown to love @PERSON and I love being with her and making fun out of all situations.

12667,21229,8," As warm @DATE days turned into chilly winter nights, the girls (@PERSON, @PERSON, @PERSON, @CAPS and @PERSON) and I were wondering what we should do to add a little pizazz to our life's. No one knew what was to come or the laughter we would experience. It was one of the biggest games in the @ORGANIZATION season. It was to determine whether or not they would go to the playoffs to compete for the @CAPS. @CAPS is the biggest @ORGANIZATION fan known to man. She was of coarse, all decked out in @CAPS attire. We watched the game, had a few shots of apple juice and pigged out on @ORGANIZATION.   Halftime was coming right around the corner and to say the least, the halftime show wasn't going to be all that and a bag of chips. I pulled my camera from my @PERSON look alike bag and pressed record. While I was walking around in a circle trying to get everyone in the video, @PERSON was having a little too much fun on a red exercise ball. She was bouncing up and down at least @NUM or three inches into the @CAPS. A light bulb went off in my head. I handed the camera to @PERSON and slowly moved over to where @PERSON was bouncing. Just as @PERSON screamed, ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS!"" I kicked the exercise ball out from under her and when she came back down she was straight on her back!  @PERSON was too busy laughing and trying to breath to tell @CAPS how stupid I was. I was on the floor curled into a ball trying really hard not to pee my pants when all of sudden I hear this bang sound. I look up and the camera was lying on the floor next to @PERSON, @PERSON, and @PERSON who were laughing along with @CAPS. @PERSON finally got the strength to get up. She came over and smacked @CAPS across the head and said, ""@CAPS't ever do that again."" I'd say we had a better halftime show then the @ORGANIZATION did.  As the game ended, the weather changed and it began to snow. While everyone scurried to find their shoes, knocking into one another, I grabbed the camera not worrying if I got sick or not. We spent the last hour doing two of my favorite things; taking pictures and making memories. We went back inside and slowly went into slumber after drinking a little too much hot chocolate and apple juice. @PERSON has always been an early bird. I felt this sharp pain in my back and I shot straight up. Only to quickly realize that it was only her fist. Soon after everyone else arose from their warm blankets. Everyone @CAPS @CAPS. We let her sleep and wondered outside again. It snowed. A @CAPS. We thought of a plan and began to gather all the snow into one giant pile. @CAPS is a heavy sleeper so we picked her up, open the door that led to the backyard and plopped her right down in the center of the pile.  @CAPS's eyes opened big and wide. Her mouth followed doing the same thing. She used every bad word she could possibly think of, including some in @CAPS that even she didn't know the meaning of. Soon, we were all in the snow laughing so hard we couldn't even @CAPS our breaths to apologize. @CAPS came to realize that it was an exceptionally good joke and began laughing along with the rest of us. In the end, we all had a good laugh and a cold to share that night. Laughter is the most important element in any relationship. It makes the bond between you and others stronger.

My two best @CAPS are @LOCATION and @PERSON. I've actually know both of them since we were little. It was about second grade when we became @CAPS. Although we were never really close until about sixth grade. Now days @CAPS closer @CAPS @LOCATION, then I am to @LOCATION. I remember when @LOCATION and I would throw little pieces of eraser at each other across the room nearly missing our teacher. The first memory I remember @CAPS @PERSON was maybe when we were in third grade. We would goof off and mess around in @LOCATION. The three of us haven't hangout a lot since high school started. It also doesn't help when we each go to different schools. But when @LOCATION, @PERSON and I do hangout were always laughing and having a good time. One example of laughter bringing us together, is when we went to @PERSON skate park for my birthday a few years back. @PERSON's grandma was taking us there and along the way we asked if we could stop and get @ORGANIZATION. I just got an @CAPS camera for my birthday so I decided to bring that along. We went the the @ORGANIZATION's located on @NUM street. As we were going through the drive-thru and @PERSON's grandma was ordering. @PERSON decided to roll his window down and started ordering stuff for himself at the same time his grandma was. He asked for a @ORGANIZATION and a large fry. What made this really funny was that his grandma was getting mad. She told @PERSON to stop and told the person over the mic not to listen to the male voice in the background. But @PERSON kept doing it anyways. When we were pulling up to the window to get the food @PERSON told his grandma to pull up far enough so he could get the food. So as we were pulling up @PERSON rolled his window up down and got the food. @CAPS so glad I brought my camera and recorded the whole thing. When we got there we hopped out of the car and went to the park. It was later in the day when we got there, probably about three or four. At first none of us really skated cause we were looking around. But when we did start skating we stayed there for about four or five hours. Cause when we left it was dark outside. There are four stair sets there, the two stair, the three stretch, the three block and the five stair. That's the order they go in from size and how hard it is to @PERSON them. Cause we were there for so long we had a lot of videos recorded. Some where of us skating, some where really random and funny, then others I don't know what the heck was going on in them. Later that day when we were tired and bored of being there @PERSON's grandma came and picked us up. They both came over to my house when we got back. We just watched @CAPS and played video games. Its always funny to watch one of us get frustrated because were not winning. Eventually we stopped and listened to music. Around @NUM p.m @PERSON went home and @LOCATION stayed the @TIME. As we were in my living room he was messing around @CAPS the tri-pod I had got @CAPS my camera. As he has it in his hands, he's unscrewing it and it falls apart. We both laught at first but then I got mad cause I just got that. This day was really fun, it was full of laughing, dedication to skating, and our friendship. It was a day that I felt closer to @LOCATION and @PERSON.  ",16,20,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12669,21233,8,"                            Laughter @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS  @CAPS your little, your exactly that, little. You look up at everyone with not a faint clue of @CAPS to do anything. Now, this is usually @CAPS your parents step in. They feed, and love and take care of you, but @CAPS importantly, they teach you what you need to know. Growing up I've learned that you need to help others, not just yourself. One way I find easy for me to help others is with laughter. Laughter isn't something that just effects the people around you, @CAPS also effects you. You can ask anyone if once in they're life anyone has ever made a difference by making them laugh. Or could have made a difference my making them laugh. @CAPS will be able to think of a time this has happened, some @MONTH not. Though I know for a fact, someone has made a difference in my life just by making me giggle. For instance, I remember a day @CAPS I had felt so alone and forgotten. I felt used, betrayed even. Growing up I knew my friends as a second family. They were always there for me. Though like @CAPS kids we fought, but by the end of the day everything was backed to normal. People say, ""@CAPS come I never noticed @CAPS easy I had @CAPS @CAPS I was little? I thought I had @CAPS bad then?"" @CAPS @CAPS doesn't matter @CAPS the problems change its all the same. @CAPS still hurts to fight with friends. You still have days you feel horribly alone, but your not quite sure why. One of those days where the littlest thing seem to cut the deepest. This day was one of those kind of days. Now see, I was young then; I was only in the third grade, and my best friend had been a girl named @PERSON. I don't remember exactly what we had fought over, but I do remember @CAPS if felt.   I remember walking in the classroom, near tears by then. I'd dealt with @PERSON being so cruel before, but whatever she had said that day had really hurt me. I was always the first in the classroom, I'm not sure exactly @CAPS I was, but I always was. In my seat I sat down and didn't move. My brain had taken me to my own little world of sorrow. That's @CAPS she asked me what was wrong. Even as a child I hated @CAPS @CAPS people I didn't really know asked me if I was okay. @CAPS embarrassed me, for @CAPS was just another reminder that I was showing weakness to people who probably didn't care. Though this time @CAPS was different, and in a weird way @CAPS helped. I explained to my teacher what had happened in a rush of tears and details. What really made a difference is that after everything, my teacher tried to comfort me and make me feel better, she made me laugh. Whatever exactly I had told her, her response didn't just make me feel better, but made me realize @CAPS wasn't that big of a deal. I giggled for a while to myself, and by the time everyone was in the class I was happy. At the end of the day me and @PERSON were back to being best friends. My teacher honestly did me a favor. As a kid your vulnerable. You don't look at the world as a harsh, unforgivable place. That's why people turn out like they do. Its all about the environment they grew up around. I believe I was changed by that small effort. That one little joke made me realize everything's going to get better in the long run. Laughter's been important to me ever since. I helped me realize the effect you have on people. Even at a small age you still can make a difference. Since then I've used what my teacher had taught me. I learned that sometimes, even if you couldn't make them laugh, smile or just be happy; the fact that you tried really made the difference. Laughing is important. @CAPS changes people, no matter what the age.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

12671,21236,8,"  Every @DATE my family, friends, and I pack up for an exciting trip to @ORGANIZATION. we always take our @CAPS runner, and boat along with us. We rent a large cabin that is right on the water side. We stay for about one week and it is always around one hundred degree's, so we normally spend the majority of the day swimming in the water. It is located over the pass about an hour from @CAPS. Their are many fun activities to do at @ORGANIZATION like @CAPS, kayaking, aqua cycling, bike riding, boating, and lots more.   This was the first year that my brother had his boating permit and I was very excited because it is way more exciting to have him take us out tubing rather then my parents who go very slow, and they don't make it that much fun. He would always put one of us on the @CAPS runner to @CAPS the flag when one of us fell off, and one of us would be on the tube. One time he took me and my friend @PERSON out. It was in the latter afternoon, and that's when the water gets rough, and choppy. First @PERSON was on the tube and I was flagging on the back of the @CAPS runner with my brother. He would have us going around in circles at about @NUM mph. She ended up flying off right away.   Once @PERSON got up on the @CAPS runner I hopped on the the tube and i told my brother I was ready. We would do thumbs up to go faster, thumbs down to slow down, and @CAPS your arms around like your crazy to stop. He started going and I had my thumb up for a while waiting for him to get going. He started going really fast and I was flying every which way going in circles. Every time I would hit a @CAPS I would get whip flash. I put my thumb down to go slower and he didn't slow down he kept going faster, and faster. Then I waved my arms around to make him stop. @PERSON was the one watching me, and she thought it would be funny if she told my brother that I wanted to keep going faster. Finally I did about two back flips into the water. I hit the water so fast that it felt like my skin was going to fall off, it hurt so bad.  It took about a minute for me to finally get to the top of the water when I took a huge gasp of air. I was sitting in the water waiting for my brother to drive over and pick me up. Something didn't feel right, I didn't have my bikini bottoms on any more. I started panicking and told my brother not to come over. I looked all around in the water for them but they were no were to be seen. I told my brother and he called my dad. My dad and mom were on there way to bring me a pair of shorts because their was no way I was getting out of the water with no shorts on.   I had a blast at @ORGANIZATION and I have a great story that I will be telling for the rest of my life. I cant wait to go back next year and i know that I will be bringing an super tight shorts to go tubing in.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12672,21237,8,"  When you laugh, what are you thinking about? Who are you with? What are you doing ? When you were three you laughed because someone went, ""@CAPS-a-boo""and they contorted their face. When you were thirteen you laughed because someone looked different and wasn't wearing clothes that were ""in"". By the time your twenty-three you laugh with your friends because your friend is drunk and doing something stupid in the middle of the party. But when you find yourself at thirty-three your laughing while your husband is wrestling your five year old. Well about three years back my brother and I finally figured out how to have a relationship.   The @PERSON family has always been complicated. When we tell people how we are related, their response is always, ""@CAPS...What? Start over!"", so we try to avoid the topic. My brother @PERSON has lived in @LOCATION his whole life with his mother and step @CAPS, so neither our @CAPS or I really had a close relationship with him. Although it wasn't our dads fault, we only saw @PERSON maybe twice a year. In those two times a year, @PERSON and my sister @PERSON, would always pick on me, hide from me and laugh at me because I couldn't do what they could. I used to hate it when he was coming down, because I knew I would spend most of that time crying and getting in trouble for things I didn't do. When three kids grow up together they find that they like each other better when they get along. My brother wasn't so mean to me anymore and he figured out that we were on the same side against the common enemy: @CAPS. Our relationship has always grown around laughter, we get along because we are able to make jokes about one another everyday and know that it means nothing. Its our way of showing we care about each other, sometimes we laugh at other people and sometimes we laugh at ourselves. Now that my brother is off at college, we actually miss each other, and the key to our relationship is the laughter we share.  When my brother found that he actually liked me, he taught me everything about video games and helped me, we were not only on the same team in the video game, but also in real life. Summer @DATE my brother and I were sitting at home, bored because @CAPS was at work and @PERSON didn't have a car in @LOCATION. We decided to play all the video games at least once throughout that endless day. That challenge didn't last long because the first and last game we played that day was @CAPS @NUM. We started off just figuring out how it worked and where to go and we fought about it for a good hour. Then we started playing just to see who's team won, we started making jokes about each others players and we gave all the bad players, mean, really weird names, we laughed through the whole game. Then to make things more interesting we got into making our own characters and building a fantasy draft. @PERSON, being a guy, came up with the grossest names and made the players look either really scary or really funny, he stacked their stats so they had an overall team average of @PERCENT in everything. I, being a girl, made all my guys really hot and muscular with funny names and only stacked their stats to what I thought was reasonable, depending on their good looks, so my team average was only @PERCENT. From the moment of the tip, to the the moment we looked at the final stats for the game, we were laughing. Every time the announcer said one of our players names in that basketball context, it was so wrong but so funny, ""@CAPS @CAPS for two"". When both teams made every shot and then by some chance somebody missed one, we made so many comments and jokes. By the time @CAPS had gotten home, he thought something was wrong because we were crying so hard from laughing, that our tan carpet had turned brown . Even through dinner, when we had calmed down, @PERSON would say something only I would know what it meant and we would just burst out laughing and @CAPS would look at us with a dumbfounded expression. Looking back I wouldn't trade anything for that day.  Now @PERSON and I sometimes bring up that day when we start playing a sports game or were just talking on the phone. We laugh and use context to make fun of each other. Ya you could say its not a very normal relationship, but that's how we know we love each other, because truth is, I don't even like video games, I only ever play a video game when he wants to. So since that day we have become closer, we don't fight, and we actually stand up for each other. So who ever said, "" Laughter is the shortest distance between to people."" is right.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12673,21238,8," It seems like everyday of everyone's life they are being tested in every way shape and form and it seems like it will never end. It gets to be stressful and complicated but this is what makes us human. Something else that makes us human is laughter but no matter how bad things get to be it can always be changed by a knock knock joke, comic ad, or just one word from a best friend. Iv been with my dad and a couple of his high school buddies as they are telling stories about some of the crazy stuff they did when they were in high school. My dad and his friend @CAPS went off into a story about when they bought a @NUM @LOCATION tempest for @MONEY. It turned out to be the greatest life lesson and some of the funniest stories in my life.  This was my dad's second car he ever had with a @NUM and a @NUM speed anything was possible. It started out when my dad first drove it to school which didn't last long, because an hour later. @CAPS and my dad left doing a burn out on speed bumps in the school parking lot. This car was a burn out animal backing up then side stepping the clutch to second and it would all be up in smoke. One day my dad was sliding around gravel corners and one of the rear bias ply tires blown out it thrown that car into the ditch and messed up the side pretty bad. Joe enders pulled him out and half a gallon of dera glass a hammer and a can of paint later it was ready to go again.  The next story I heard was when my dad's friend borrowed the car he needed something to get him back and forth to work. So my dad hands him the keys and says ""keep it on @NUM wheels"". Two weeks later on a weekend he was out messing around and the car slid off the road and rolled a few times and buckled the roof. I never heard how he got out but somehow he did and returned the car to my dad. After that it had an organ transplant of a roof from a @CAPS that hit a tree, @NUM weeks later and it's ready to go again. Now it's just something about a rear wheel drive car and snow that makes us kids again. sliding around in snow was the last thing this car ever did. My dad and @CAPS were driving in the snow having fun when the back end decided to trade places with the front. They lost control as they slid across the winter wonderland to a lonely telephone pole. The car slid into the pole and it was the end of fun. Finally the car had died and my dad had brought the car back home. He decided not to fix it and parted it out he sold the @NUM speed for @NUM @MONEY the engine for @NUM and the rear end for @NUM the trunk and hood weren't far behind for another @NUM the seat, steering column and radio my dad kept, the rest was scrap. So all in all my dad had some of the greatest moments of his life for no more than gas money and a few spare parts. God bless @LOCATION and I hope someday soon I can have memories like that.

12675,21241,8,"  Laughter is important  The last two weeks of school, and I was told the best news ever. My mom had told me that I would be flying to @LOCATION, by myself. I was excited because I haven't seen my family in awhile. Even though @CAPS been on a plane a couple of times, I was still scared, I have never flew by myself, so this was going to be something extremely new. Even though I was excited and scared at the same time, I just kept thinking about seeing everyone in my family, and even meeting family members that I have never seen or heard from before. School seemed to be going by very slow, and I was very anxious. When two weeks passed I already had my bags packed and was ready to go. My mom was trying not to cry, but she did anyways. I walked threw the metal detectors then down a long hall way, finally I had got on the plane. On the plane ride I was thinking about meeting my real dad, and that's all I was thinking about the whole time I was on the plane. I landed in @LOCATION at @NUM pm that day. I was glad too because I was tired. My sister picked me up from the airport. Me and my sister didn't have a close relationship, so it was kind of awkward. She started talking about times when we were younger, and how we had fun. Since I was in @LOCATION I wanted to see a lot of my family members, most of my family members already knew that I was in town, news travels fast. When my aunt's seen me they were in shock, they said that I had grew so much. I was so happy because it was one of the best moments ever. I met so many people, especially family friends, it was a amazing because I even met some of my moms school friends. Days after, I had got a text message from one of my sisters that I have never seen or met before, and she was so happy to know that I was in town. She told me that she and my dad wanted to see me, and spend some time together, so we made plans. I was really nervous, because the only time that I have seen my dad was when I was really young. That was fifteen years ago. I really didn't know what I was going to do or say when I was finally going to meet them, I was very scared, so I decided to take my sister and my cousin just so it wouldn't be awkward. We decided to meet at my grandmas house. I haven't seen her in awhile, and unfortunately she wasn't there. When my dad got there, I didn't know what to do, I didn't recognize him, or even my other sister. We gave each other hugs. When we got into the house we were all quiet, and all my dad could say was ""@CAPS"" because I grew so much. He then started talking about the silly little things I did when I was a little girl, and it made us all laugh. All we did was laugh, and it made me cry a little.

12677,21245,8," What exactly is laughter? Is it when something virtuous happens and it makes a person joyful? According to @PERSON's @CAPS, laughter is a cause of merriment. In other words a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships, but plays a big role in life itself. An example of laughter being important in relationships is, when a very good friend of mine stopped speaking to me over this empty-headed quarrel we had about some animal becoming instinct. It had been almost two years exactly, since her and I haven't spoken. I thought nothing would brings us together, until one day when I was at the store and we ran into each other. We just looked at one another and just started laughing. Right than and there we figured out that the argument we had was pointless, and not worth talking about. To be more clear with this story is that without laughter my friend and I would have never been reunited. When you meet new people what's the first thing you tend to do to get them to enjoy you? You usually tell jokes, or say something funny just to get a chuckle or two out of them. This is where laughter ties into life, physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual. When you meet a new person you often see those individuals have at least one thing in common. I guarantee that in every single friendship laughter is the most common thing people share together. There is no possible way of getting around it. Another example of why laughter is important in life is when someone is looking for a job, or going to a job interview and the one who is in charge of making the decision of whether or not you get the job has no personality. What do you most often do in this type of situation, either show your serious side or possibly crack a few jokes. If this doesn't work well at least that person has a good idea about your personality. Learning how to handle life can become very stressful, also trying to handle it mentally can be quite a challenge. A friend of mine just graduated from college and she was struggling on trying to find a job that she studied in. She was very stressed out, and also very depressed because her grandma was in the hospital and ready to pass on. @CAPS didn't know what to do, no money was coming in yet, and she couldn't find an apartment she just was a mess. Until one day she told me that she revived a call from her sister and her sister mentioned that their grandma couldn't hold on and she was ready to pass. @CAPS rushed to the hospital and went to go see the last of her grandma before she passed. Her grandma grabbed her hand and told her, ""I know life can be mean and just give you no chances but you have to get through that and enjoy life. Life's to short to be worrying about what tomorrow will bring. Just put that smile on your face and laugh when life gives you the worst."" @CAPS and there @CAPS realized that what her grandma had said was true. You can't live through life in a drag, just have to get up and take it. @CAPS was very devastated about her grandmas lost, but @CAPS again she felt it was meant to happen because without her grandma telling her about this she wouldn't have never known that her grandma experienced the same thing as she did. She didn't feel like she was the only one in the world that was going through these difficult crisis. She will always love her grandma.  When you learn how to take life as it comes people tend to notice it is indeed a very hard step to achieve. Individuals learn in many other ways or some just don't learn at all. For example, @CAPS learned from experience going on with school and struggling with tying to find a job. Her grandma told her right before she passed on because her grandma probably most likely experienced it as well. Other people learn form meeting new people, and just having fun with life, or like me I learned the hard way by not talking to a very good friend of mine over a empty- headed argument. Laughter comes in different shapes and sizes, we as human beings have to approach it, whether it's an argument or learning it as it comes. One way or another it will come and we have to be ready for it, its not a scary thing. The benefits of laughter is it makes you happy and people tend to be having a good time. Laughter is a positive thing, and people shouldn't ignore it, its a good stress reliever as well. Laughter is a cause of merriment, a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships but plays a big role in life itself.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12678,21246,8," Laughing at @CAPS bell. @CAPS best friend and I have a lot of funny, hilarious memories together. We are always laughing about something even if @CAPS's something completely stupid or actually really funny. We laugh at things like people that look funny, or people that say stupid things. Also we laugh at funny things we do. @CAPS one thing that has always stuck to @CAPS head, the time at @CAPS bell. One day after school, me and @CAPS best friend @PERSON decided to go across the street from our school and eat lunch at @CAPS bell. We ordered our food and went to sit down and wait for @CAPS. A few minuets later our food was ready and we sat down to eat @CAPS. ""@CAPS"" I said to @LOCATION as i took a bite of @CAPS @CAPS five layer burrito. ""@CAPS""@CAPS was really hot and burned @CAPS mouth. I had to wait for a few minuets to eat @CAPS burrito. So we both just sat, waiting for our burritos to cool off, an talked about school and other things that was going on with our lives. A couple minuets later a man walked in, he was about @NUM or @NUM years old, and he had his back against us so we couldn't see his face. The man ordered his food and turned around to take a seat. Meanwhile I thought @CAPS burrito was cooled down enough and i went to take a bite, at the same time the man looked at us and he was wearing a clown mask and he had a little dog with a tiara on his head. Next thing i knew @CAPS burrito was coming out of @CAPS mouth and I was dieing of laughter.  @CAPS burrito was spit completely out of @CAPS mouth, and all over me an @LOCATION. All over @CAPS hair, mouth, clothes, and all over the table. I was so embarrassed that i couldn't help @CAPS to laugh. I think the main reason i was laughing so hard was because the man was just so scary looking, @CAPS wow we were laughing for what seemed like an hour straight. You might think this was the end of @CAPS bad day, @CAPS @CAPS only gets worse. Eating @CAPS burrito seemed forever, because we were laughing forever. @CAPS probable took me a good ten minutes to eat a single burrito. Meanwhile i got thirsty and needed something to drink. So I went to order a small drink and get some @CAPS. As i was returning to @CAPS table i wasn't looking and ran into a man that was in line. I almost spilled @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS luckily I didn't. Returning to @CAPS seat i was talking to @PERSON about how bad @CAPS day was, and how @CAPS couldn't get any worse. Then i took a drink an I started to choke on @CAPS @CAPS, @CAPS was so bad that i spit everything out onto @LOCATION, @CAPS went flying everywhere, @CAPS even came out of @CAPS noes. So i went into the bathroom, and cleaned @CAPS self up, caught @CAPS breath, and told @PERSON i was ready to go home. When i look back and think about the day at @CAPS bell with @CAPS best friend, I not only think about how embarrassing @CAPS was for me and her, @CAPS also that @CAPS was a really great, hilarious memory that i will probably remember for the rest of @CAPS life. As i said before @CAPS best friend and I have a lot of funny memories together, and still we are making more everyday.",17,20,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12679,21247,8," There is a difference between right and wrong. Most of us learn from it and most of us don't. We all have a choice either to face of @CAPS we have done wrong, or just lie about it and get into even more trouble then you already are. Ever wondered when you are about to do something wrong and you don't think first? Well this was one of those times when I wasn't thinking first. I was nine year's old, @ORGANIZATION, @PERSON and I, were playing at the park joking around, playing on the old rusted blue swing set, just having a good time. Nothing much to do at a park but shoot hoop's, run around, go on the monkey bar's that have ton's of bacteria on them, down the drenched slide, and play tag if we had the energy. @ORGANIZATION see's two rusted broke down car's that look like they have been there for centuries. @ORGANIZATION say's out of his dumb brain of his "" We should go over there and throw rocks at those car's you guy's."" I shack my head, nodding at @ORGANIZATION with a wide grin on my face. @PERSON say's with zero tolerance for any negatively say's "" @CAPS we shouldn't those car's are owned by somebody. How would you feel if someone idiot kid's came and wrecked your car's?"" I think for a second, well he does have a point. I would flip my chicken if some idiot kid's did that to my car. We are all looking at each other thinking @CAPS to do. Sixteen minutes go by and still nothing. With my idiot brain i say "" @CAPS's, do those car's don't belong to anyone? They don't even look like then can move, look's like they have been sitting there sense the dinosaurs were here."" @PERSON walks off and mumbles to him self "" @CAPS idiot kid's I already know they're going to get into trouble."" @ORGANIZATION and I look at each other like we just saw a ghost. We finally start heading towards the rusty broken down car's. On the way there with @ORGANIZATION's clumsy feet trip's over a piece of wood.  Finally get to the two rusty broken down car's, I pick up a rock. I think for a second to ask me is this okay? should I be doing this? Just with pure pressure and the guilty conscience, I threw the rock. One after the other, just kept on throwing rocks, pipes, car parts, logs, and beating it with a gigantic metal pipe. @ORGANIZATION and I leave, now we are exhausted we take a break and look at @CAPS we have done to those rusty broken down car's. The two car's look like the just been hit with a tornado. @ORGANIZATION and I just start laughing our head's off. We kept on laughing almost until we were about to wet our selves. There was @CAPS one around and @CAPS one saw us. At least that's @CAPS we thought.  Was about four day's later and back at the park @PERSON and I, and @CAPS sign of @ORGANIZATION. About to go home from the park a tall, blond, old, big feet, lady walk's up to us and asks us out of @CAPS @CAPS "" @CAPS do you to live?""  We were just kid's at the time and I say without even thinking one tiny bit "" I leave right down the street, it's the second to the last house. I'll show you if you would like?"" The lady with big feet reply's "" @CAPS that would be great, thanks."" @PERSON and I start walking home just wondering why did that lady want to know @CAPS we live? Get around the block and we see that lady's car in front of my house. @PERSON and I look at each other and I knew @CAPS he was thinking. @PERSON was thinking that I'm screwed.   The lady with the big feet ended up being the owner of those two rusty broken down car's. I didn't know @CAPS to say or do. Just the thought going through my mind that was telling me I'm screwed. Never been so grounded and whooped hard in my life. If there are some lesson's of @CAPS @ORGANIZATION, @PERSON, and I have learned it would be don't touch anything that is not yours, be respectful of @CAPS is not yours, treat everything with respect even if it's not yours, and not to be idiot kid's again. This has shown @ORGANIZATION, @PERSON and I right from wrong, telling the truth, face @CAPS we have done wrong, and think about doing something before your actions get's you in trouble.

We both decided that it was to hot do anything outside, and nothing was on tv. We thought we were just going to be laying in bed all day, roting away in the heat. But then @CAPS comes up with this idea to play some video games. @CAPS we turn up some music, blast the streo. Put in some @CAPS Of @CAPS and start killing people. @CAPS were killing people, whipping butt if i could say. Then @CAPS says ""@CAPS im getting really tired, plus it's gettig really warm."" @CAPS then i try fixing the ac. @CAPS im working on the the ac and are is just laying in bed. Time went bye, seems like it was taking forever for the day to end. We had nothing to do. We were stuck. Then @CAPS started telling me a joke. I was a chessy one but it still made me laugh. @CAPS here were sitting on her bed telling each other some jokes to pass time away. After awile the jokes get old, now were sitting on her bed again. Falling asleep because there's nothing else we can do. Music is off, window is open, @CAPS all you can hear is the cars driving by one the street. Out of no where @CAPS farts, and it wa snot no girly fart. It was loud and stinky. Right away I start to laugh. While she is getting enbarested, I don't remeber why but then I farted to. She started to crack up laughing. Her face was truning red. @CAPS we both started farting back and forth, reminder we were in the sixth grade. But nothing was as funny as it was when what is bpout to happen in my life. It's @CAPS's turn to fart, and she is getting all ready than she farts. But this was not like any other one! She stopped laughing right away, looked at me with a frown on her poor little face and said""@CAPS i think i just pooped my pants!"" I started laughing @CAPS freking hard, i started to cry.

12681,21249,8," It was the first day of the ninth grade, that terrifying day when one must choose how they are to be percieved for the next four years. I walked into my first class looking like a hippie on steroids, just over six feet tall and nearly two hundred and sixty pounds of long haired, freckled teenager. I was a giant, and that made it difficult for bullies to muster up the machismo to treat me as the freshman that I was. I sat down in my designated seat, next to one of the girls I could tell thought too highly of herself. Despite this off putting first impression, I atteampted friendship. My atteampt was met with confusion and disgust.  As I turned to face the front of the class once more, there stood the teacher. @PERSON announced that our first assignment was to create a presentation, one that would show the rest of the class who we are. I was excited at the prospect of a presentation. I have always been a showman, and the limelight is a very dear friend. I love to act, sing, and in general entertain. My crown jewel however, is humor. I have found that I can captivate an audience no matter the number, with humor. With this I designed a presentation to entrap and engage my class in the reality of who, and what I am. I wrote a speech in which I explained my talents and the many things I enjoy. In this speech were many twists and turns of phrase, punchlines and puns. There was such laughter that other teachers came to see what was causing the noise.  I took a bow and sat in my seat, looking around at the shining faces of my new friends. I knew then and there that laughter would be the tool with which i would build my highschool life. I could make someone forget about their troubles for a spell, or brighten someones day with a few words. I wasn't a star athlete. I wasn't even a star pupil. But I seemed to collect friends like I was made of fly paper. There is no better feeling i have yet felt, that compares to the company of friends. As long as i have humor, I shall never be without that feeling.",22,20,0.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0
12682,21250,8," I met my best friend, @PERSON, in the third grade. Best friends are the people who come into your lives and stay with you for the rest of it, through the easy moments and the hard times. We learn from our best friends and share experiences with each other. No matter the distance, their friendship is always there for you, even if you are thousands of miles apart or just a few houses away. The laughter between two best friends is an element that bonds them for life, because when two friends truly laugh together, they will always have a small moment in their lives intertwined for as long as they live.  @PERSON and I have grown up together. We were there for each other from learning how to jump rope at school through broken bones, school-girl drama, crushes, boyfriends, heartbreaks, weddings and funerals. We helped each other get through everything from hard classes to family pets dying. We offered advice and brought hot chocolate, but this is only the beginning of our friendship. After the problems were solved, we learned how to laugh at our mistakes and move on. Together, we have gotten past slip-ups in what we say, to slipping on the floor. After we have giggled over what the other did or said, we helped them up and moved on. @PERSON and I know that, no matter what situation arises, we will always be there for each other, because we have the each others backs. @PERSON can make a joke out of any occasion. She is one of those friends that can make you smile just by seeing her face or hearing her voice. Most of the best moments in my life have usually involved @PERSON in some way. We have memories from lying in the driveway and watching the stars at night, to cracking up while working backstage for the local drama club. @PERSON can always crack me up with her perfect imitations of anyone, no matter how bad of a mood I am in. I crack @PERSON up all the time, usually unintentionally, by saying or doing something ridiculous, which shows my true blond side. We laugh over lines from our favorite movies and write down the funniest moments. We have shared so many memories together that we laugh over everything from driving around town and listening to music to being followed by the kiosk workers at the mall. One of the funniest times we ever spent around each other was while we worked backstage during a production by our local theater club. We laughed about everything from building sets to mistakes on stage. We had to open and close curtains in the dark, while wearing full black. I stubbed every single one of my toes that week while rolling the sets on and off stage. My hair was impossible to miss from the audience's point of view, even though I kept cramming it under a black ski hat. @PERSON would always have a problem opening one of the curtains that would get stuck when it was halfway open. She had to frantically tug on the rope even thought it kept getting caught in the pulley. I would laugh at her mistakes and she would laugh at mine. We both had a lot of fun watching the audience, director, and actors all at the same time. @PERSON and I got to stand in the back and watch all of the actors mistakes, giggling silently with each other. Every time one of the actors would make a mistake, we could watch the audience laugh and the director's face, which was usually horrified for a moment. Now whenever we mention any word or line from that play, we both start cracking up and remembering the entire weekend. There were more jokes then could ever be written down, and every time it is brought up, we remember even more funny moments.  When we are near each other, one quick look or a single word muttered under our breath can crack us both up. We can make each other laugh without even explaining what we meant, because we have shared so many experiences that we can read each others minds. Just one key expression or a twinkle in our eyes can crack the other up. Most other people around us probably would not even notice the small crinkle in the corner of our eyes or a slight smile. Those are the best codes ever imagined, because only the person that it is meant for could figure it out. The messages shared through the eyes a best friend can silently bring up subjects never spoken about and make us laugh. This is why true best friends are bonded by laughter, because it keeps them close no matter what comes, and for every moment of sadness, there are two moments of laughter and happiness.",26,22,44.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.0,44.0
12683,21251,8," Laughter has many benefits; happiness, joy, bonding with others,adreneline, the helping of releasing tension, and the joking that is made on a daily basis around you. Laughter is something that can be shared among people especially when they're in the dumps. This emotion is the one that will brighten up anyday and bring enjoyment. Laughter has been a huge part of my life. From family, friends, boyfriends, and stangers laughing has always been a big deal to me. I love being able to look at someone and see that they smile alot, which means that they probaly laugh alot and that they are a happy person. How can I tell this. Well for starters there is dimples in their cheeks and crows feet in the corner of their eyes. Really the crows feet don't matter about how old you are they can happen from laughing, smiling all the time, and squinting in the sun. The biggest part of laughter that has contributed to my life is having a relationship. Usually when you have laughter in the relationship it will make it last longer. The reason the relationships will last longer is because you can be yourself and let the other person see that you are fine with laughing and being part of their life. I believe that laughing in an relationship is the best part. Lets say your partner is in the dumps, are you just going to let them be moody all day or are you going to try to make them laugh and cheer them up. When I'm in a relationship and my partner is being moody I try my hardest to cheer them up. I love to make people laugh. And when I'm being a grouch my boyfriend is helpful and tries to make me feel better or they just comfort me to see what is wrong. So if there is not laughter in your relationship then obviously there will be no happiness. Therefore it will not work out between you and the person you're with. So spread the joyfullness of life and and make people happy. Another part that laughter that has been in my life is friends. If you don't know me well let me tell you I'm shy at first, but once I warm up to you, you'll see that I'm a very outgoing person. Like most of my friends will say is that I am weird, but I enjoy laughing alot and making others laugh too. When I'm around my friends and in the dumps someone will always in the end will get me to laugh. No matter how upset I am they can always get me to laugh at pretty much anything, since I am a really easy person to entertain. Being around these people is like watching a comedy movie or act. They are always finding some way to be funny and annoying. Such as being obnoxious and doing stupid things that others will never do because it's embarassing. Well just because it is embarassing doesn't mean you shouldn't at least do it. If you don't do it, it will give us more to do and give us all the attention to ourselves. How are you suppose to know whether or not it's funny if you don't want to try something new. How are you suppose to laugh at yourself and have others laugh with and at you no matter how stupid it is. So don't knock it until you try it. The person that once said, "" laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is it true or false? Is this really the shortest distance or the longest? I honestly believe that is could be the a short distance. You don't want to be snooty or crabby all the time or you will never make friends or have any relationships. And if you don't have friends or any relationships then who will make you laugh and enjoy yourself. If you're not a happy person then how are you to experience the joys of life and everything around you. You won't, so put a smile on you face and be a spontaneous person who is not afraid. Laughter is a benefit to all man kind. And laughter in my life has showed me so much, it has brought me and others so much experience to enjoy. Those enjoyments that have been explored, are having boyfriends, friends, and family around me all the time. This is one emotion that is definitely one that will brighten up anyday and bring happy expressions to every ones faces. Share the laughter.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

There are so many effects in the process of laughing.Your laugh can have such a strong effect on your body that it can cause your eyes to become a little teary. Sometime when u laugh its also harder to breath and your stomach might start to hurt. When somethings really funny I usually have a hard time to get another gasp of air because i cant stop laughing.That's one of the effects that happens to me while I'm laughing. Everyone knows that when someone thinks somethings funny they laugh. We can laugh at a movie, a joke,or even a simple mistake.My family always makes me laugh.When we have party's were always laughing and cracking up jokes.One of the jokes that my cousins said is that my aunts baby was so white that it look like a came out of la lechera. Lechera is a @CAPS word.  Another thing that also made me laugh is when i went to my cousins house. We were watching a movie and i had to go use the restroom so i went and when i came out she jump out from around the corner and scared me. I screamed so loud that my other cousin yelled from up stairs to be quiet.

I do think a @CAPS laugh is the most unique though! @CAPS you hear your child, niece, nephew, or grandchild laugh you should hear there happyness.    A laugh changes @CAPS you grow older. I remember hearing my sisters and brothers laugh at the simplest things @CAPS they were younger. But now they never do, now they laugh at sick and disgusting jokes and they laugh @CAPS someone gets teased. But thats not my case. I am the one who laughs @CAPS someone does something sill like on americas funiest home videos. But a child laughs @CAPS you make a funny face or @CAPS an animal does something funny. They laugh at the littlest things.     To me a smile is just a silent laugh. I remember hearing a saying ""A smile is worth a thousand words"" and I think that goes for laughter too!

I know for a fact that @CAPS I was younger I was abused and so @CAPS ever something good happened which was hardly ever but I had a huge smile on my face then some one would do something funny and I would try not to laugh but I only lasted like @NUM seconds, then I would start laughing so hard that I would start to cry!

But @CAPS she started to cry my dad started hopping on one foot and held the other then he fell on his butt. I laughed so hard that afternoon! Then later that day he took me and linda to the store to each buy one new doll!     Again I @MONTH say that a @CAPS laughter is the most beautiful thing on earth! Just for some reason it heals the soul! You @MONTH start off on a bad day then you could come home at the end of the day and walk into your house to your child laughing.

I started off in a bad situation but now I am a smart intelegent young lady! Every laugh is unique in there own way cause every one is different.

The car moved as slow as a turtle into the car wash machine. I had left the window crack open to were enough water would crawl in. We were kinda talking about the concert and i had looked very unaware that my window was open, i actually had too no idea that a lot more of water then i expect had came in. She looked across at me and was like laughing so hard see couldn't even speck of what was happening. I looked at her and was like what? She was your windows open and i had turned and came too find water was rushing its way down and sorta frightened me and i jumped into the air and rushed too close the window. She was laughing like there was no tomorrow and so was i. From that moment on it was such an ice breaker for all the tension that was happening. the elephant had left or side and we had a great rest of the day.

This helps you threw hard times or just makes somebody day better for them and puts a smile on there face, or gives them a joke to say to somebody else to continue a chain of laughter thew people. Sometimes it can be the most embarrassing thing that people remember about u but in the end the other person that laughs at you for your indecent probably did something like that a long time a go so in the end there laughing at them selves to and don't even realize it. I remember on my fifteenth birthday my grandma toke the hole family out to dinner at a chines restaurant. It was quiet except for the adults discussing what they should order form the family meals. I was siting by me sister looking at a menu just to see what they had to drink, well her mined was on other things because out of no were all u heard was ""they have no fricken chicken"". Every one busted up laughing at her even the waitresses son that was standing behind the both and his mother. It made every ones day because it wasn't the best of days at the time. But u could tell she was embarrassed but laughed at her self to her comment to the table was ""i thought i said it in my head"", i looked at here and said ""no u didn't"" so she just shrugged about it.  To this day when ever we go to a chines restaurant my mom looks at here and ""says they got your fricken chicken""so she looks at here and ""says will that ever die""we all looked at here and said"" no its going to be passed down to your children they'll here about there mothers fricken chicken day"".It was that bad of a indecent that she gets up set that it wont go away but it still gives every one else a laugh. even though it was so long ago that it happened are parents joke that its going to be her wedding toast it went kinda like this"" as long as you give her, her fricken chicken you @CAPS will last forever"" it was not the nicest of comments to be said about that day but it was still funny to the rest of us. this is something that will last in the family for years to come ,and hopefully will be passed down in the generations to come.Even if she doesn't want it to be just think in time ens-ted of us telling every one about the incident she will tell them her self and just laugh about it because it was just that much of an out off nowhere thing to happen. We still pick on her about it and many other things she says out loud with out noticing she says them. But those are story's for another time and day you never know what could happen. just remember to laugh its true what they say its healthy for you so make the best of some of the worst days possible.  So if your having a not so good of a day,u never know what could happen to give u a smile and a laugh even if your the one that makes every one laugh. So just think of something that makes u laugh and tell the people that are special in your life about it to give them a laugh and make there day a little better then most.Even if its one of the most embarrassing events to happen to you in your life time.

Let me share with you a personal story of my own.  I recently just started dating my boyfriend and his name is @CAPS. We first met here at school and then he transfered and moved away, then a few months ago he added me on facebook and we started talking again. At the time we had started talking he had a girlfriend but shortly after finding me again he realized that she was not the one for him anymore. It was rough for him to break up with her but he did it and i am proud of him, becuase she treated him very bad.  In the beggining of our relationship we were both really shy and didnt talk much but the more and more that we hang out the more we start talking. We want to be the type of couple that can talk to each other about anything in person the way that we do in texts. Everytime i see him i get really nervous and it almost seeems as if my heart skips a beat. Whenever we are walking down a street i cannot help but to smile. And when we lay on the cowtch and watch movies i can't help but to laugh when he tickles me. We laugh at each other all the time, wether its when one of us makes a mistake or what not. I believe that laughter and the way we get along is what keeps us going strong. Everytime he leaves i cannot wait to see him again. Laughter is what keeps most relationships going because without it i feel like it would be a really boing and if it is boring than you wouldn't want to spend time with one another.

I myself was one of those people but with a slight difference than some others. I had what I like to call a @PERSON who in actuality in my biological father. Up until I was seven years old I thought that my dad @PERSON was my quote on quote ""real dad"", but one evening I heard my mother down stairs yelling at someone on the phone. My mom was yelling at this unknown figure about child support and signing over his rights to my dad. I had no idea that who she was talking about was me and in fact the one on the other @DATE of the line was my biological father. The moment I heard your son deserves better than this I ran upstairs to my room and began to weep because I thought that @PERSON was my dad but now this new figure in my life is claiming to be. My mom had heard me run up the stairs and came to tell me the story of what was really going on. As it had turned out my biological father had rights to my last name and unless he signed these over to my dad, my mom would take him to court and force him to pay the thousands he owed her for child's support. During this little story that she was unveiling I had learned that I have other siblings out there in the world. Over the next eight years of my life I would spend countless hours running through old phone numbers and email address's trying to find my other siblings. It wasn't up until my freshman year that I met a guy who went to my school and was in the same grade as me, named @PERSON. He quickly became one of my good friends and we hung out every other @DATE. On one occasion that he was at my house playing video games with me, he chanced upon a question of what my last name was. I thought to myself that this was a peculiar question but in the @DATE I told him. All of the sudden a smile crept across his face and he asked if I had a biological father named @CAPS. My mind started to reel over this sudden question. @PERSON started to explain to me that he was half brother to my sister @CAPS who was one of the siblings that I had been searching for. Almost before I @CAPS think to ask the question of how; he had called my sister and explained to her he had found her brother. As it had turned out, she had been looking for me just as hard as I was looking for her. @PERSON asked her if she would like to meet me and I heard a high pitched squeal of joy from my sister saying yes on the phone. I to was overjoyed at the thought but I had no idea of how awkward it would be to finally meet her the next @DATE. On the @DATE that I met my sister, @CAPS mom had come to pick me up to take me to her house. As we were driving so many thought were racing through my head that I thought I would puke in the car. When we finally arrived at her house @PERSON who is @CAPS mom, urged me out of the car and into the house where my sister that I realized looked almost the same as me was sitting on the couch looking just as nervous as I was. During the next four long nerve racking hours, my sister and I played @NUM questions with each other to get to know one another. After doing this we were more comfortable with each other and she looked a lot more accepting that I was truly her older brother. By the @DATE we were telling jokes and laughing hysterically. We realized that we even had the same obnoxious laugh (that every one hated) and that to made us hit the floor laughing. At one point in time her mom had to tell us to quiet down because we were going to wake the baby if we didn't and by the @DATE of the @DATE we had connected with each other so much that she even gave me a hug before I left. @CAPS and I connected most through our laughter the first time we met and from that @DATE to even now; every time we see each other we giggle and smirk. Since we found each other or in my case her brother found me; I have gone to her house every other weekend. My sister is one of the most precious people I have in my life and that will never change because nothing we say or do will ever stop the laughing and joy we hold towards one another.",20,23,0.0,43,0.0,0.0,0.0,43.0
12690,21261,8," We couldn't control our selves, our eyes watering, and our stomachs hurting so much we can't move. I was choking on my words as I talk to my best friend @PERSON. Every time we talked to each other some one would say something that we thought was funny and we would start laughing and laughing. When I look back on the things that we talked about most of what we said didn't make any sense at all and I don't know why we laughed so hard. One day at our bus stop @PERSON said something very funny and we laughed until the bus came. Than I said something funny and we laughed the whole bus ride to school. This happened almost every day for us. On this particular day we couldn't stop laughing not even when we got to our class room. Our @CAPS grade teacher had lots of pets in her class room and one of her pets was a tree frog named @CAPS. That week was @PERSON's and my week to take care of him. When we went to feed him @PERSON grabbed him and made him dance all over his cage. We both thought this was the most hilarious thing ever. Our eyes started watering and we were chocking on our words as we took our seats for class.  We laughed through the teacher giving instructions and while we were doing our class work. Eventually our teacher had to come up to us and tell us to be quite. This didn't stop us from laughing. We tried and tried to stay calm and do our work but we just couldn't stop. On this day lots of people in our class were chatty but no one was laughing as hard as @LOCATION and I were. We were so loud I thought the people in the class below us would hear us for sure.  It wasn't just us being loud it was the whole class. Our teacher stood in front of the class and yelled at us to be quite but that didn't stop us. In fact it made @LOCATION and I laugh even more. I thought I was going to pee my pants I was laughing so hard. Now @PERSON and I weren't the kind of girls who giggled quiet about things. We were the kind of girls who laughed really hard and loud with our eyes watering and our stomach muscles hurting us for the rest of the day. Our teacher wanted the whole class to be quite so she got in front of the class while we were doing our math problems. She told us to put down our pencils, push in our chairs and stand behind them, so we did. Then she told us to take a really big deep breath in, and we did. Next she told us to let out our breath as big as we cold. Lastly we were suppose to do that five times and then sit back down in our chairs and do our math problems silently with out talking to anyone. When @PERSON and I were taking our five deep breaths we did them very fast and very short to get them over with. We thought it was very funny and so did the rest of the class that saw us. The class started to laugh there heads off and the teacher didn't know what to do so she told us we would all have to stay in at recess if we didn't behave. Eventually the class settled back down and started doing there work quietly. Except for @PERSON and I. We kept laughing until the bell rang for school to be over.  We got on to the bus and started talking about how much fun we had that day and how funny it was when we were breathing really fast and not slowly like we were suppose to. Even to this day every time a teacher or someone tells us to take deep breaths for something @PERSON and I look at each and start laughing, and than we breath really fast. Now we are sophomores in high school and we still have times where we laugh uncontrollably for no reason at all. I think its just a part of being best friends with someone. Some times we even laugh all day long like our day in the @CAPS grade. Through out our friendship we have learned to be much quieter when we do our breathing and when we laugh during a class or something important. I believe that @PERSON and I will always be best friends and we will always have our laughing moments together weather it's in a class, on the bus, while we are driving, at college, or on the phone. Laughing is something that everyone needs to experience in there life time. Not a giggle or a small laugh out loud but a really hardy laugh were you can't control yourself, your eyes are watering and your stomach hurts to bad to move just like @PERSON and I did in @CAPS grade.

12691,21262,8," It all started one @DATE after school, when my girlfriend and I decided to make a plan to go to my house. We were not planning to walk home, we missed the bus. @CAPS we began to walk down the ramp from the high school. While we were walking we got hungry. @CAPS we went to the @ORGANIZATION. We ordered a @CAPS and some drinks. @PERSON decided to shake up my soda @CAPS hand it to me. Me not knowing what's up @CAPS I asked, ""@CAPS you shake up my soda?"" @CAPS said, ""@CAPS I @CAPS here's mine, let's trade."" I @CAPS and ended up opening the one @CAPS shook for real. "" That was a lil devious!"" I said. @CAPS when I stood up to chase her and poor soda on her, I tripped and fell on some goat heads. While I was in pain, @PERSON was cracking up with laughter @CAPS said, ""@CAPS @CAPS stupid, who falls over a stump!"" @CAPS I got up from the ground and pulled all of the thorns out, @CAPS continued to walk home. We were already more than half way to my house, when @PERSON decided to hit me in the shin and run. Of course not learning my lesson the first time, I chased her. I chased her for about a block and a half. Basically to my yard before I slid on mud, and @CAPS fell in a puddle of water. I thought I was going to loose it when @PERSON was laughing too dramaticly. Out of @CAPS were, I jumped up and was going to put her face in it. @CAPS ended up running inside my house, and locking the door. The reason I knew @CAPS @CAPS lock it, was because I ran @CAPS fast to bust in. before I @CAPS I turned the knob, but it didn't open though. Instead the impact forced me to fly back, and land on poop. The bad part was that it was fresh, why, well because my back was warm in a certain spot. I quickly took off my shirt and threw it away, @CAPS headed inside to shower. @PERSON asked me why I was going to shower, but I decided to lie to her. @CAPS I told her what really happen, @CAPS @CAPS will laugh and make fun of me. After I was done showering I asked @PERSON, ""@CAPS you want to go shoot some glass bottles in the back?"" @CAPS replied, ""@CAPS I'm down let's go!"" @CAPS I set up six bottles and was ready to shoot. First @PERSON tried and hit four out of six. That's pretty good for being a girl. @CAPS I went to replace the four bottle @CAPS shot. As I was doing @CAPS @CAPS shot me in the butt.""@CAPS!"" I yelled and wanted to cry, but I didn't. The only thing I @CAPS was swore like @CAPS other, and aimed my gun to @PERSON to get her back. @CAPS was quick to run upstairs and grab my @NUM. @CAPS said with a freaked out voice, ""@CAPS you come any closer I'll throw this out the window!"" @CAPS I said to her, ""@CAPS you won't, you know how much I paid for that!"" @CAPS my luck shot her in the leg. Well turns out @CAPS wasn't lieing bout throwing it out the window. It was ok though, because I could get another one. That @DATE with @PERSON was great, but @CAPS laughed at me most of the time. I didn't care, whatever makes her happy. I really @CAPS like making her smile. I delt with a lot of pain that day, and lost a shirt with poop. It's all good though, it's going to be a great memory when we look back on this day. ",18,20,36.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0

As @CAPS and I sat there and laughed about what had just happened, I had seen that @CAPS couldn't really open her mouth because she was laughing to hard and her cheeks hurt from laughing, she ended up drooling into the little sauce bowl that at soy sauce in it, and when seeing that I new that I couldn't help but not tell her at all. The night came to an end when @CAPS ended up dumping her water all over the waiters son. I had to appologized to the waiter that night and her son to.

The lines are extremely long but I am with some family that I haven't seen for a while so we talk and catch up. My uncle who is there with us tends to play tricks on the kids and embarrass me. He has given me wedgies, put his kids diapers under my pillow, and many more crazy tricks. I knew this trip would be no different so I tried to stay clear of any plans he had in mind. @CAPS was going to be a rather warm day today so I put on some basketball shorts and a t-shirt. We headed out with five kids under the age of @NUM so I knew we would be going on some smaller rides. After we went on ""@CAPS's a small @ORGANIZATION"", we decided @CAPS was time to go to the bigger rides but we would need some lunch first. We went to a burger shop and were waiting to get our food, so me and my uncle decided to have a spit ball war. We were shooting across the isle from table to table trying to dodge people walking by. I hit him twice in the side of the cheek so he told me I had won.  Once we ate our food and went outside to leave he told me, ""@CAPS see who can hold your little brother above their head for the longest"". I not thinking about @CAPS said, ""That's easy!"" and lifted my brother up. Little did I know that was a big mistake. He walked over and pants-ed me in the middle of the walk way. I stood there with a kid above my head and my pant's at my ankles. People sitting down at tables stared and laughed as they saw all this happen. I was so embarrassed, how could I be so stupid to fall for his trick. I couldn't believe I had fallen for @CAPS again. @CAPS happened so fast and I didn't know what to do other then chuckle inside. After that we decided to head to space mountain to get some fast passes. They allowed for you to not have to wait in line and go to the front, but they could only be used for certain times. We had to wait for about twenty minutes and @CAPS was raining. So we put on our blue @ORGANIZATION ponchos and the kids were playing tag. My brothers were the loud crazy kids that always have energy and don't stop running. They would keep coming up behind me and hitting me in the back and running away. After about the fifth time I couldn't take @CAPS anymore so I told them if they hit me again, they were going to get hit back. After about two minutes I got hit in the back again so I turned around and walked up to a kid in a blue poncho and hit him on the back of the head. Little did I know I had just hit a random little kid in the back of the head. I felt horrible as the kid looked up at me with a blank stare wondering what had just happened. I was so embarrassed that I ran and hid behind a tree as my my uncle and parents were apologizing for what I had done. Although my family was embarrassed for what I had done they were laughing hysterically inside at the same time.

12696,21268,8," Laughter is a part of my life. When I laugh, I always have this feeling of happiness and a connection with others. Laughter makes any relationship stronger. I remember when I was sad, I would go and talk to my friend @PERSON. I went to him because we could talk about why I was feeling that way. Then after a while we would be laughing - being happy. Laughter brought me closer to my friend. We were able to understand each other. We have been friends since we were in elementary.

12697,21269,8,"  Middle school was a challenging environment. Not only are kids subjected to a rapid advancement in the academic environment, but a maturing social environment as well. The rapidly growing need for social dominance and in turn inflating egos makes for a bully breeding ground. Without the skill to be able to laugh it off, I would fear for anyone's mental well being in that environment.  Throughout my first @NUM years in middle school, I struggled with the building social discomfort of classmates higher in the social chain, making for a severe toll @CAPS not only my self-esteem, but my academics as well. The stress of my own social stature plummeted my grades continuing a cycle resulting in even more stress. The whole situation seemed hopeless and depressing. I could not believe that in only a little over a decade of life, my outlook had become so grim. I wondered how I would make it through the rest my school years.  Everyday I had the pleasure of hearing any number of new insults made up by those higher in the social ladder, attempting to supplement their growing self-esteem and inflating egos; @CAPS some days even those who I previously believed to be my friends joined in with them. Except for a few trusted companions, it seemed the whole world was out to further themselves by bashing me with any number of new insults.  Being made fun of daily had continued until I realized something; That laughter is key in social survival. Without laughter there was no way I could have survived those school years. After this revelation I was able to laugh at things said to me and laugh at myself as well. I was able to take the the cacophony and learn with it, taking it as critique to better myself. Through laughter and their jarring remarks I was able to secure my position in the social scheme as well as improve my intelligence, as well as make new, better friends and come to peace with others, while maintaining the the hurt I experienced earlier to be ""popular"" without having to make fun out of those who were like who I used to be; @CAPS a win-win scenario.  Laughter is key in any situation, whether it be a conversation with a friend, or experiencing the penned up frustrations of immature adolescents. From laughter I learned a great lesson, one that I hope everyone has not learned should. Without the lesson of laughter, I don't know how anyone could lead a successful and pleasurable life.

Walking past someone I @MONTH not know also has its positives. One look to see their face can tell me if they are having a good @CAPS or a bad @CAPS. Either way, I give a smile. A smile to show that it is a good @CAPS or a smile of encouragement to let them know it will get better. I enjoy the feeling I get @CAPS I meet someone and I know that we connected great. A good first impression is very important for me because it can determine how the friendship will go and how long it can last. I now know that I enjoy being around someone like me who enjoys to smile and laugh. I can't really seem to see myself around a serious person and I know if I was, we would clash and have problems because I am loud and if they are serious, there would be problems and not be able to collaborate on decisions.  @CAPS I first met my friend @CAPS, I was nervous and scared because we were set up as a blind date by a mutual friend. It was a @ORGANIZATION's @CAPS double date with our friend and my cousin. @CAPS the guys first picked us, I got into the car and the first thing that I remember was seeing a big smile on this guy's face. I ended up getting more nervous and began to stutter as we started to talk. As the date went on, he seemed like a down to earth guy and always seemed to have a smile on his face and laughter seemed to flow right out of him. As time went on, we became closer than what I would have ever thought of. I was not sure where our friendship would lead us, but soon after, it became noticeable that he liked me and I liked him. We took it slow, not rushing into things. We had long conversations that would last us hours at a time and we always seemed to laugh about everything. He made everything seem better and better each and every time we talked. Pretty much having the same personality and both always smiling and laughing helped us connect right away.  Just the other night , @CAPS and @CAPS, our mutual friend, came over to visit my cousin @PERSON and me at her house. We were all laughing and enjoying each others company @CAPS @CAPS and @PERSON decided to go to the store and buy some things using @CAPS's car. Since they weren't going to be gone for long, @CAPS and I decided to wait inside. Minutes after that, as we sat, talking to each other, @CAPS and @PERSON run into the house looking flushed, out of breath, scared and nervous about something. @CAPS wouldn't look at us, so @PERSON told us to go outside, something had happened to the car. As we stood there, I realized that the car was no where in sight in the driveway, so I became suspicious. We asked them where the car was and they pointed to the road and in the dark all we could see was the faint outline of a car in the ditch. I was expecting @CAPS to get mad and say something to @CAPS, who seemed to not know what to say, but instead he smiled, walked towards the car and said, ""@CAPS't worry, the car is fine."" @CAPS he said that, he started laughing, his amazing laugh. I was still in the state of shock and so @CAPS I heard that laugh of his, I turned and looked at him, and realizing that he was happy and didn't seem to mind the accident, I began laughing as well and in less than @NUM seconds of him beginning to laugh, not only was it us four laughing, but also two of my other cousins that had joined us outside. Laughter made the situation better and I enjoyed the fact that we could all laugh about the smallest, the unexpected and the worst as well as the best. What also made me happy, was the fact that that very same night after the incident, @CAPS asked me the question I was hoping to hear and the way he said it made me laugh which then caused him to laugh. I answered his question with a hug and a yes and he brought out a banquet of roses. As we walked inside, my cousins and my aunt started to applaud and we all started to laugh with smiles on our faces.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12700,21273,8,"Most people think that laughter helps you live longer, love longer, and show who you really are. I believe all of that is true, laughter is one of the most important things a person can do. In my life laughter has helped me threw the hardest situations and made them a lot better. You can laugh a lot with friends, family, or people you barely even know. Laughing can mend relationships and help you get threw anything, in my life i have found that out many times.My mother and myself haven't always had the best relationship, we don't always get along, and since i have a severe separation anxiety from her we spend a lot of time together which can cause friction from being together too much. There was a certain time when we had just gotten into a fight about me wanting to go somewhere and her not letting me, i was expecting her to be mad at me for awhile for how rude i was being. We didn't talk for a couple hours and tried to stay away from each other, we would only talk to each other if it was really important. After a couple days of this going on i went into her room to talk to her about it all, when we talked i understood why she was so mad at me and i apologized and left her room, but i could still feel that there was some tension between us. I wanted to make things better more then i have ever wanted anything, i wasn't really sure if she was ready to get over this fight, so i thought it would be better to give her some space and let her come to me when she was ready to talk. We both tried to stay away from each other for the rest of the day trying to cool off and really think about what we were truly mad about. The next day we went to go do somethings around town, some grocery shopping and to see some family. In the beginning we didn't really talk much or anything. Within an hour of us leaving the house and having our alone time together we were joking around and laughing at everything each other said. After our errands we went out to lunch, it was the funnest time i had ever had with my mom, we talked about everything and laughed and had an amazing time. The days after that were wonderful also, we spent a lot of time together and felt like we didn't want to leave each other, i know that laughing together and talking really helped with that, we opened up to each other like we never had before. I love my mother and care for her more then anyone in the world, when we got into that fight i was scared out relationship would never be the same again, we were able to work it out by laughing. I honestly think that laughter can cure anything, from a broken heart to a broken family.",17,17,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12701,21274,8," Laughter is important in many ways. It can help you solve an argument with a friend, improve your health, and help in akward situations. All relationships need a little laughter to lighten the mood once in awhile. If we didn't have it, everything would be taken seriously all the time, and there would be many more feuds. One instence where laughter has helped, was when my best friend, @PERSON, and I were in a big fight about someone spilling paint on a pair of shorts she owned. We were both accusing one another, and the more that happened, the worse the fight became overall. I remember right in the middle of the fight, @PERSON made a face that for some reason made me laugh. Once I laughed I could tell she wasn't amused. She began questioning why I was laughing. So I explained to her why I had been laughing, and she ran to the bathroom and looking into the mirror, made the same face that I had been laughing over. To my surprise, she started laughing as well. After the ten-minute laughing fit, I made a joke about the paint on her shorts, and we decided to splatter them with paint for a rather ""unique"" look. Needless to say, laughing saved us from getting into an even bigger argument. When people are angry or upset, physically they probably don't feel that good. They @MONTH feel angry for days, which in turn can give them physical pain. I know for me if I'm angry long enough I'll succumb to a headache and ironically, I get more angry at people around me because my head hurts and they're making it worse. Laughing is a way of @CAPS things go. Not necessarily being carefree, but learning to let go and live. Physical health is greatly affected by laughter. As well as mental health. Everyone needs to laugh to stay sane. Learning to not sweat the small stuff is really important. My favorite thing to hear is ""let go laughing."" @CAPS go of a problem while laughing is the best way to get rid of problems. I've also noticed that when you laugh more you feel better overall. You have more energy, but that's usually from the endorphines kicking in when you have a crazy fit of laughter. But also it lightens the mood tons when you're with other people. All people need to laugh. Married couples, students, teachers, and best friends. Laughing can bring people together. In the end, laughing can benefit you in many ways. It can help resolve feuds, lighten moods, and have good effects on your mental and physical health. And the best thing to always remember is to let go laughing.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12702,21275,8," There is @CAPS more fun than going to a friends house after church. It is like a comic relief in life after a r rough message to @CAPS heart. In @CAPS, going to your friend's house is even better when your friend is, to say lightly, kind of crazy like @CAPS are. Which for my story, could be interpenetrated as a bad thing, but for me it is @CAPS but a great thing. My friend and I have had some of the craziest time together, and the funny thing is we @CAPS't have to be doing anything illegal too! Its such a bonus! We get our giggles from cleaning, playing with magnets, and watching theVampire @CAPS, and much more. Strange? Yes. Fun? To much. Let me tell @CAPS of somethings that have happened to my lovely friend and I . First, like always, there is a @DATE and I'm heading over to my good friend's house. Its a very short walk, I leave my church by twelve and am there by twelve o' five. I'm up the steps, I'm to her door, I open it. Bark bark bark! ""@CAPS up, @PERSON,"" @CAPS yells from another room. The snowzer pup come and greet me. He knows @CAPS better. The one dog eats rocks for @CAPS sakes. But @DATE, @CAPS has her reasons to yell, and be a little grouchy.  ""I didn't realize how many dishes there were! My sister will freak if @CAPS knows your here and they are not done."" ""@CAPS't worry, I'll help @CAPS, and we'll get them done before your sister notices.""  @CAPS, we are off. @CAPS wonders the house frantically for dishes and putting them in the sink. @CAPS, I work on putting the clean ones in the dishwasher away. We hear a sound from her sisters room, and we jump. @CAPS's sister sounds like @CAPS is waking up but @CAPS snorts and the noise ends. @CAPS we get back to work. When we got done, we @CAPS slumped on to the couch looked at each other. We @CAPS were tired and our hearts were still pounding. @CAPS, her sister snorts again. we laugh hysterically, and her sister tells us to @CAPS up. @CAPS another day, I come over and we are @CAPS really hungry. We @CAPS haven't eaten all day long and go into her kitchen. ""@CAPS do @CAPS wanna eat,"" @CAPS asked me. ""I @CAPS't know. @CAPS do @CAPS wanna eat, "" I replied back. ""I @CAPS't know, "" the endless cycle. But, @CAPS my eyes cross paths with a bag of chocolate mint chocolate chips. @CAPS fallows my gaze and see the bag, and smiles. ""@CAPS!!"" I'm delighted, "" @CAPS!!"" we @CAPS shout in joy of the idea.  We get everything together, and begin making @CAPS. Now, @CAPS of @CAPS are really, ""great cooks,"" so when we were faced with ""who should flip the @CAPS"", it was a @CAPS brain-er.  ""@CAPS do it!"" ""@CAPS, @CAPS do it!!"" We argued till I realized the pancake was about to burn, and @CAPS I did indeed, ""do it,"" for the sake of chocolate mint chocolate chips @CAPS. But, when I flipped it, it didn't really want to end its embrace with the hot pan, and broke into pieces. Many ""stupid pancake's"" were said and spread all over her kitchen. But, eventually we ate and were happily full. @CAPS came another @DATE, and this time @CAPS had a surprise. ""I found this really cool show!! Its calledVampire @CAPS!"" I thought for a moment, ""@CAPS."" @CAPS immediately dragged me to her computer where @CAPS had them down loaded. I thought to myself, ""are these a cheep knock-off ofTwilight?"" We began watching them and they did seem cool, I liked them a lot.  The vampire brothers were in turmoil with each other, yelling and interrogating each other. ""@CAPS @CAPS of how her blood tastes!""  I paused the none existent thought in my head, ""@CAPS did he say?"" ""@CAPS @CAPS of how her blood tastes,"" @CAPS looked at me. I crack up laughing, ""@CAPS. I thought he said, @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS her butt tastes like, wow I feel bright!""  @CAPS of us start laughing like crazy at the very stupid thing I had said. We laughed the rest of the night with @CAPS that. We finish watching a couple episodes and @CAPS my mom shows up. I get my coat and the rest of my junk, and head out the door. the dog is still barking, but @CAPS comes out the door with me, we give each other a hug and say our good byes. ""@CAPS I'll talk to @CAPS later, @CAPS, "" I say heading down the steps ""@CAPS, see @CAPS at school tomorrow.""  ""@CAPS. And see @CAPS next @DATE!"" I yell from the car window. @CAPS yells back, ""@CAPS!"" @CAPS is more fun than that, a friends house on a @DATE @TIME.

12703,21276,8," ""@PERSON, @CAPS up! It's almost time you to go to school!""  @CAPS mom yelled at fuzzy hair, half-opened eyes, and yawing boy. That's me. Today is a first day of @CAPS first new middle school. Our family moved to a new place, that's why I had to move a school too. I woke up and took a shower and wore @CAPS school uniforms with exciting and nervous mind, because I didn't know anyone from @CAPS new school. When I arrived to the school, students who are same age as me started to scream out loud for sadness of school days that are coming up or excitement of meeting their friends again. On the other hand, I was depressed and confused because of these hyper students and the new school. I shook @CAPS head off and started to concentrate finding @CAPS classroom. '@CAPS hah! There it is.' @CAPS, I found @CAPS classroom and when I stepped in, @CAPS looked at me curiously for a while, since I was the ""new"" kid to @CAPS school. I sat alone and waited for teacher to come. During I was waiting, I put @CAPS head down and slept a little bit with no smile on @CAPS face. Suddenly, teacher opened the door and spoke loudly, ""@CAPS sit down and be quiet!"" @CAPS teacher must be the most strict teacher I've never seen. While teacher was writing down something on the whiteboard, the students were trash-talking about the first sight of the teacher. It was terrible for yelling at the student when you saw for the first time. For example, I knew a kid who went to a private school and transferred to a public school. I had a same class with him and I was his partner. Since I didn't know him very well, I started to ask questions about him. At first, he answered back nicely to me and I thought, 'We could be close friends from @CAPS class.' @CAPS it was wrong. He started to talk loud to me when teacher was explaining something to us and it got me into trouble for talking with him. Other students hated him for being distracted during class and he often asked useless questions to the teacher really loudly. Also, he had weirdest perfume smell that he thought it was cool to wear. @CAPS thought he was annoying which caused to a small fight. @CAPS arguing with other friends, he stopped coming school and now we don't even know where he is at. Like @CAPS, it shows that the first sight is really important to have in relationships with other people. When I heard that the first sight is really important from other students who were sitting behind me, it changed @CAPS mind to an open mind such as having a smile on @CAPS face. I though, ' I shouldn't be like that kind of teacher's first sight. Maybe I should change @CAPS face looking with smiling and some confidence on it.' @CAPS that class, I started to put smile on @CAPS face and thought positively. I tried to be participate for the class and worked hard for making new friends in the new school. Therefore, the other student opened their mind as well and started to ask things about me. For example, it was like these questions; 'why did you come to @CAPS school?', 'what sports do you like most?', 'what game do you play?', and etc. From those aggressive questions, laughter can change @CAPS looking and make good relationships. How did I know? When I first entered to @CAPS classroom with concerning face on it, @CAPS just stared at me and looked like they didn't want to know about me. @CAPS putting laughter on @CAPS face, they started to feel comfortable than the first time. Changing me depressed face was @CAPS starting point in the new school. I started to make a lot of friends which it became a way for me to be a class leader. I felt really amazing and awesome that how ""the new guy"" can be the leader of @CAPS class. I felt proud of myself and thought of happiness that I actually started to have laughter on @CAPS face since the teacher didn't look good without a laughter.",17,17,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12704,21277,8,"You know how people say that school is the most fun place to be during the day? Well i would have to be agree to that because when I'm at school I would laugh all day long when i see my friend name @PERSON. We would have fun all day long just the three of us in the same classes but two classes but we still be laughing in the halls and in the class rooms some times at each other and people that we don't know. I always loved coming to school last year but this year is not that much fun because @PERSON moved into the @CAPS-es and I don't know where she lives now but after @PERSON left the good old days was fun with her it sucks that we are not going to the same schools with her or her still coming to school with us now it is just the two of us @LOCATION and my self we hardly have some fun in class without her but most of the days we do.   I remember when @PERSON first came to this school she look like the other girls in our class but once we got to know her we became best friends. the next day she though that we would not like her because is a new kid at the school and that stuff we got to know her all to well because we would hang out with etcher teacher back from the seventh grade we would hang out. The thing that i always love about @PERSON is that she would turn anyone whom is having a bad day and turn it into a really good day for you she would always do things like that but there are some days when she is felling down and blue and @PERSON and me would try to make her feel but she would just get mad at us because we wasn't there for her when she needed us. I felt so bad after that but we are friends and friends so post to be there no matter what. The next day she wouldn't remember what was going on yesterday because she wouldn't remember that much when she is really mad at someone. one time in one of my classes we was not doing much in that class because there was not that much people in there we were painting and me and @PERSON was painting bulletin board. the colors was white and brown we kinda of got it all over the place and each other i panted her hand haft brown and the other side white and she got some of it on the paper that we was using to let it dry up so we can paint again but that did not work out so good because we had to go yo our next class. The next day we was in that class we almost the same thing but we kinda of got it on the grand, sink, sops descender, and each other we draw a little something on each other i draw a heart that has her name in it her name was in pen and the heart was in paint. In our next class we was laughing the rest of the day we even got my sister @LOCATION to laugh with us even through it was not that funny because we ate a lot of candy and candy makes us laughter all the time. these days are the days that I'll remember all the time because @PERSON, @LOCATION, and I are always laughing all that time because we always find something to laugh about and talk about. Out of all the times that i laugh the most fun ones are with my friend @PERSON because we would have lots of fun when we are with her she is the glue that was holding us together. I think when all of us are together we are always laughing every scent of the day. No matter what we did or didn't do we would laugh all that time. This one we would say ""like"" all the time in one of our classes that we would have all that time during fifth because we was the only two girls in there with four boys and a guy teacher so @PERSON and me would do almost anything in that class because we would not do anything that would get us in troble.",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0

I opened a cliff bar, while @CAPS was getting a drink. That is when I heard her scream. Of course, I busted up laughing, even though I didn't know what had happened. @CAPS turned around, and that laughter, turned to hysterical screaming. The mouth thing on the fountain had been turned towards you when you drink, so @CAPS was drenched. I sarcastically said, ""@CAPS, you won't be hot for a while now will ya?"" We both laughed, and she chased me, trying to get me soaked. Sometimes, all you can do is laugh together. Later that day, when we finally reached the family reunion, they had a pool.

12706,21280,8,"                                    Laughter @CAPS @CAPS For the @ORGANIZATION is a very important thing in life , I personally could not live without laughter in my life I honestly could not do it. I would not be me if I didn't have laughter in my life . All relationships should have laughter involved in some way ,what would a relationship be without laughter! Laughter is a beautiful thing , when I am laughing I am enjoying life in in my own way and my worries instantly go away and some how I feel like I am ""carefree "" . Laughter makes us healthy both physically and mentally . Through out my life there have been many times where laughter has been involved in many relationships . But let me tell you about a time where laughter really stood out and was and still is a big part of my relationship with my dad.   I have always been very close to my dad , you might even say I am a daddy's little girl .Laughter has played a very important role in my relationship with my dad. It somehow always found its way into our relationship. The @CAPS times of laughter are what I valued and treasured so much that whenever I think about it I cant help but smile . I remember when I was little if I ever needed a @CAPS laugh my dad was the person to call . The laughter grew stronger through out the years , I cannot recall a time where my dad and I had a moment where laughter was not involved . We always used to watch these @CAPS shows together that we would almost always laugh so hard it was impossible to get through the show without making noise or miss something because we were both laughing so hard .We would laugh so hard we would wake up the whole family ,sometimes we didn't even know why we were laughing it would just happen . I can just hear those sweet sounds of laughter between my dad and I oh how I miss those @CAPS @NUM nights were what I looked forward to, I knew that I would soon be laughing along with my dad and tears of joy would be running down our faces . I looked forward to that sweet sound of laughter it was almost impossible to go through the entire show without laughing ,oh what @CAPS times those were . Since my dad moved to @LOCATION ,we haven't had those beautiful times of laughter that I miss so much, but I can always treasure them in my heart. Those moments of laughter were the best moments I have ever had with my dad,since I was little girl till now almost an adult . I don't know if my dad and I would be as close today if we hadn't had all that laughter throughout our lives. Whenever I am sad or miss my dad , I go back to those times we had filled with laughter, and listen to his laugh playing in my head. I never knew how important laughter would be to me. I am glad laughter played such an important part in my life. Laughter is such an important part of life/relationships because it brings joy and happiness. Laughter is the type of thing that no matter what , should always be a part of any relationship. I think laughter is healthy for our bodies, for example if you're sad ,depressed ,or just not having a @CAPS day a @CAPS laugh will change that and make you feel a lot better ,like it did for my dad and I. Laughter also makes relationships last longer , the reason why I am so close to my dad , best friend, mom, boy friend , sisters etc is because of laughter itself . If laughter was not involved in my relationships , I could not handle being sad all the time everyone needs a little laughter sometime in their life. My dad is the reason why I laugh so much , he showed me how laughter is such a powerful thing but yet so simple. I never thought laughter would be such an important part of my life until my dad showed me just how valuable it really is.  Where I would be today without laughter I truly have no idea. My dad taught me how laughter can change your attitude on things and how important it is to have laughter in your relationship. If laughter was not involved in any relationship , the world would be very boring no laughter or smiles,can you imagine having no laughter at all! I certainly cant imagine life without laughter. If my relationship with my dad had no laughter we would not be the same people we are today in fact , we would be completely different people and we would not be as close as we are today. What do you think about laughter? Has laughter ever played an important part in any of your relationships?  ",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

Sometimes we argue, other times we can get along like we are the best of friends. When we were going to the same school together, I would go out of @CAPS way to say hi to @CAPS brother. Almost every time I would get shut down and ignored, by @CAPS own brother. @PERSON is going to be a freshman next year and I will be a junior, so we will be attending high school together.

I brought up the fact that @PERSON never says hi to me or even waves at me and how I didn't really appreciate it.  Some how we got to talking about how he would be known as @LOCATION's brother because I am so awesome. The next thing I know @PERSON blurted out, ""yeah, @LOCATION, I'm going to embarrass you because I am so butt-ugly."" @CAPS parents and I looked at each other and instantly started laughing and couldn't stop! When we had semi regained our composure, we asked @PERSON why he would say something like that about himself. @PERSON said he didn't really know why he said that, he thought it would be funny. Yes, @PERSON, it was!! It was @CAPS turn to pray for dinner that night. As much and as hard as I tried to compose myself long enough to pray, I couldn't do it. Every time I thought I had pulled myself together again, I would start busting up yet again. After a while, @CAPS parents asked me what was wrong. I replied, ""I was going to ask @CAPS to make @PERSON more beautiful so he wouldn't embarrass me."" I started laughing so hard that I was crying. I couldn't see anything because the tears had blurred @CAPS vision. Now, after what I said, it took me twice as long to control @CAPS laughter. @CAPS parents calmed down before I did, so @CAPS mom had to pray because I couldn't contain myself. The whole time @CAPS mom was praying, I had to clamp @CAPS hand over @CAPS mouth to keep from laughing. @CAPS grip was so hard that it made @CAPS teeth hurt. That night I think @CAPS whole family got a few spoonfuls of medicine. Probably enough to last us another week or so. I can't wait until I get 'sick' again and need another serving of medicine!

Who does not like to laugh? I will be writing a true story in which laughter will be one important part. My story will be about myself, who is an exchange student and @CAPS in high school, and how I got to know my today's best friend.It all started in the morning of my first day in a @CAPS high school. I remember clearly how nervous and excited I was. I was not able to focus on my breakfast because my mind was full of thoughts and questions. How is the school going to look like? And what are the students going to think about me? I have never been in the @LOCATION before and I have never been an exchange student. Because of all the worries, which were running through my mind, I did not even notice that it was already time to leave the house. This moment which I have been envision for month, finally arrived. My host-mom said good-bye to me and wished me a great day. Now I was totally by myself. I walked in the high school and went to my first class: @CAPS. On the way to the classroom, people stared at me, but nobody said a word. Have you ever felt like you are alone even though hundreds of people are around you? This is exactly the way I felt in that moment. My first class went well, as well as my second class: @CAPS. During @CAPS, some guys asked me if we have cars in @LOCATION. Although this question seemed really stupid to me, I answered nicely with yes. My next period was drama. I had trouble finding the drama room, but luckily I met a girl on the way who showed me where I was supposed to go.Her name was @PERSON and she told me that she moved here last year from @LOCATION. From the first moment I saw her, she seemed really nice to me. On the way to the classroom, she asked me questions about the difference of @LOCATION and the @LOCATION. She also appeared quite interested to me. While our drama teacher was preparing a scene, we continued talking. I had the strange feeling that I have known her forever. The whole nervousness I had at the beginning of the day was gone. I told her that some guys asked me if we have cars in @LOCATION. She answered that they asked her the exact same question, but about @LOCATION. Suddenly, she started to laugh. It was a happy and friendly laugh and soon I started to laugh as well. It did not feel awkward for me, sitting next to a girl I just met and we were laughing so hard. I knew that this moment, this laughter was special. I felt so happy and belonged and it let me forget all the fear and doubt for a few seconds. What I did not know in this moment, though, was that she will become my best friend. This was my true story, in which laughter was an important part. It is not easy to be @CAPS in school, especially if you are an exchange student. My story showed that a laughter is able to change people's thoughts and to short the distance between two people. In my case, it made me feel more comfortable and confident, which was the start of a great relationship, as well as an awesome time in the @LOCATION. The end",20,19,38.0,38,0.0,0.0,0.0,38.0
12709,21285,8," High school years are tough for many teenagers if you don't have a friend that is always willing to put a smile on your face during the worst times. I had a great friend named @PERSON. She had that special power of making me laugh no matter what. We stopped being each others friends around the end of our sophmore year. It was both our faults for letting our friendship come to a closer. It wasn't like we made enemys with each other. But we didn't end our friendship so nice and peacefully.  The @DATE going into my junior year i had forgotten why we weren't friends anymore. If I didn't remember why we weren't friends anymore, then obviously it was a stupid thing to fight about. But things were said to one another. So it would be a lot harder to make-up. I really didn't want to be the one to apologise first. I did the worst thing to our friendship and just let it stay like that. It was the first day of my junior year. I hadn't seen one sign of @PERSON anywhere. It worried me because I thought she might of moved away and I didn't get the chance to say good-bye to her. Lunch had past and that is when I mostly saw everyone. And there was still no sign of her anywhere. As I walked to my last class of the day, I was seated in the front row. Once I was settled there walked in @LOCATION. I had a little smirk on my face knowing she was still she hadn't moved away. She turned to look at me with a serious look. For that one sceond I had forgotten we weren't friends. My face bacame serious as well. It was great knowing she was still living here, but horrible knowing we still hadn't made peace with each other. But I didn't want to be the one to apoligise first, beacause I knew she would think I was the one to blame. So leaving it like that was all I could think of. The semester went by really fast. Seeing her everyday during class made it harder for me to even be in there. I lost a really good friend from something I don't even remember. I've noticed she's made new friends and has moved on with our friendship. She still once in a while hung out with my group of friends. When we both joined cheerleading we saw each other more after school. But we still didn't talk. It really felt like she was acting as if I never was a part of her life. At first I hated her for treating me that way. But I also had to take responsiblitie for what I had done to her.  One night I felt so out of it. I really needed a friend that could just let me forget about my problems and bring a smile to my face. The only person that came to mind was @PERSON. I felt very alone at that time. So I decided to write her an e-mail. It would have been better to have aid it to her face but I know I would have chickened out if I did it face to face. So an e-mail was better than nothing. I told her I was wrong about a lot of the things that came out of my mouth. I told her how much I missed her friendship and how much I missed her presents around me. I woke up the next morning feeling very sick to my stomach. I didn't want to go to school but I did anyways.  During lunch time I sat at my usual place in the hall. @PERSON came out of no where and sat next to me. She smiled and said ""remember when you tripped in the @NUM grade?"" I could not stop laughing when she said that. Tears came down face face for how hard I was laughing. It felt like its been forever since I laughed that hard. We talked a lot about our summers and about what news have been happening in our lives. We laughed more than we talked. I really had my funny best friends back.

On days that I would be sad because of some stressful and unhappy things that were happening in my life at the moment. My friend @CAPS would come to my house to cheer me up. He would cheer me up by making me laugh, a lot. The main ways that he could make me laugh, when he would notice that I am sad were, tickling me randomly a lot, saying a funny joke or asking me a silly question and by making me play a video game or two, that I was very embarrassingly bad at. The first way he can get me to laugh is by tickling me. When he would come over we would just sit around and talk about random stuff that popped into our heads. He would notice me getting sad at some point and he would say that if I didn't cheer up he would tickle me so that I laughed to get cheered up. I wouldn't really cheer up so that he could make me laugh, to cheer me up. So, he would start to tickle me a lot. I am ticklish basically everywhere, so I would laugh hysterically and it was so much fun. After he would finally stop tickling me, I would still be laughing. If I were to get sad again, he would just keep on tickling me until he was sure that I was happy. I would get happy that day because of laughter.Another day that he was over just hanging out with me. I might not have been having that great of day. We would be watching a movie and eating pop corn or watching t.v., and he would notice that I wasn't really that happy. So, he would try and make me laugh to cheer me up. He would get me to laugh by saying some funny silly joke or asking me a weird random question. Little funny things like that will always make me laugh. Through out the day or while watching the movie. He would say something like it is so nice outside. When it really wasn't, he was just making me laugh. Or, something in the movie would happen and he would say how that would never be possible in real life. He would just get me to laugh to cheer me up. In addition to tickling me and saying something funny to make me laugh, he would also make me play a video game to get my mind off things. At his house one time he said that we should play some fun video games for something to do, because it would be rainy outside. At first he would show me how good he is at one of his favorite video games, likeAssassins @CAPS. Then he would say that I should try to play it. I was not very good at it but it was fun. I am not used to the controls of an @CAPS @CAPS so I wouldn't know how to do some things, and he would make fun of me for it because it was actually supposed to be easy. When I couldn't do something I would laugh about it and give the controller to him because I couldn't do it and he could. That would make me laugh because I couldn't do something simple like run up a wall in the game, so, I would have to give it to him to do and that was funny to us. Being bad a video games is funny to me and it make me laugh. In turn that would make me happy which is important.In conclusion, by my friend @CAPS tickling me a lot, saying something weird and random, that is silly and funny or, by getting me to play video games that I was bad at and had to have him do it for me, would make me laugh. By him making me laugh, a lot, it made me very happy. Laughing is very important part of my life and this story. It is important because if I didn't laugh as much as he makes me, I would not be as happy. If I am not happy, that isn't a good thing. Because, being happy is a very important part of any life and relationship. Most of the ways I can get happy are by laughing. So, this story shows that laughing is very important part of my life. You could also say that is important in my relationship with @CAPS. He make me laugh which makes me happy. That is very important to me.",16,20,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12711,21287,8,"Laughter is the shortest distance between two peopleFor the longest time I never thought that I could be happy. I felt as if every time I tried, someone was always there to say ""@CAPS no, she's about to be happy. Better take everything away from her."" That's @CAPS always happened; I was the one being dumped, cheated on, or losing a best friend. I would lie awake at night sometimes and wish that maybe someday someone out there would listen and care and understand. I didn't think that wish would come true, but somehow it did. @PERSON was the type of guy you could tell anything to. He would listen and care as if it was his problem also. That's @CAPS attracted me most to him. His sense of knowing when things weren't right and attempting to make them better. The thing I loved most about him was how he could make me happy when I felt so down. He didn't live close to me, he never came over and we barely knew each other but he made me smile better then anyone I've know for years. I guess I never believed laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It didn't take long for that to be proven wrong.Freshman year and I was lost. I just wanted to be popular, make friends and get a good boyfriend. My main focus that drove me through each class period was boys. It wasn't the best thing I could have focused on but hey, they got me through. I still remember sitting in my math class when a tall boy with brown-blond hair sat in the front row. @PERSON was his name, and I suddenly became attached. I did @CAPS most girls do when they see a cute guy. Made a fool of myself. I was so sure that I was never going to get a chance with him until I got his number. The story goes on from there, we dated and dumped. For a while we didn't talk. But that's @CAPS made us bond even more. We later became best friends, and that is how I became happy.My boyfriend, was not a good boyfriend at all. It took me a while to realize this because I was entranced on his ability to make me feel important. I assumed I wasn't important when I called @PERSON, crying the night he cheated on me. Usually when you ask a boy to help you with your problems, they don't know @CAPS to say. But when I talked to @PERSON he seemed as if he was going through the same thing. His perspective on the dilemma helped me get through it. I talked to him for the longest time that night, explaining how I felt. To my surprise, he actually cared and listened. After hours upon hours of talking, @PERSON and I finally realized that we have to be related in someway. Him and I have so much in common. We have both been through the same scenarios and we both help each other get past it. One time after a dance @PERSON called me saying, ""I cried, when @PERSON left tonight."" I helped him. Then later that month, he thought she was cheating on him. I helped him. I remember calling him one night and he woke up just to hear me tell him I quit the dance team. People tell me not to get too attached to him, but I cant help it. We don't even have to be in the same room and he makes me smile. All the things we have been through make me laugh. He makes me laugh. He isn't the class clown or the comedian, but its just something in the way he can be himself and not get embarrassed that's @CAPS makes him so fun to be around. We @MONTH fight and not get along sometimes but I know he will always be there when I need him.Sometimes I sit and think back to the beginning of the year. When I was timid, quiet and unhappy. I think of how @PERSON is the most caring guy but you wouldn't notice it unless you got to know him. I think, ""@CAPS if I never met @PERSON"" and I wonder if I would be the same person I am today. I now recognize that I have changed so much over these few months. Maybe its from @PERSON, or maybe its just myself. But I'm pretty sure laughter has something to do with it. It brought me and @PERSON together in the beginning and it keeps us together even now. From being total strangers and now best friends.

We can come back another time...or @CAPS not come back at all."" @CAPS mother laughed and continued to search for a parking spot. I slumped down in @CAPS seat, discouraged and lonely. @DATE was the first day of @CAPS sophomore year in @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION, and I had to spend it at a new @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION; @ORGANIZATION. Transferring to a new @ORGANIZATION would not @CAPS been so bad if I hadn't been forced to leave the @ORGANIZATION I loved, the @ORGANIZATION I had friends in, the @ORGANIZATION which met @CAPS selective needs and wants. I was dreading this day and only wished I could go home and sleep this vivid nightmare away.  @CAPS mom had to practically drag me from our minivan to the @ORGANIZATION doors, for both @CAPS body and mind were aching to run in the opposite direction. There was a massive crowd of students swarming around the room, which would later be known to me as ""the commons."" @CAPS mom introduced me to the woman in charge, @PERSON, then waved goodbye and headed back to the car. I felt nauseous, and @CAPS heart was pounding as I glanced around at @CAPS new peers. I did not see even one familiar or friendly face. Not being an outgoing person was a struggle for me, especially when I was faced with new surroundings, such as this @ORGANIZATION. The truth was, I didn't even want to make any friends. I @CAPS wanted to go back to @ORGANIZATION;@CAPS @ORGANIZATION.  As the day progressed, @CAPS mood only got worse. No one had even tried to be nice to me, and I wasn't really trying either. As the students were taking a field trip down to the @CAPS campus down the street, I ran into a girl who looked @CAPS as uncomfortable as I did. @CAPS had long, blond, straight hair, brown eyes, and a pierced nose. We started walking together, our steps in sync with each other, although no words were exchanged. We both @CAPS felt more comfortable standing next to each other, rather than standing alone. At the @CAPS campus, I decided to abandon @CAPS timid, protective shell, and I asked her where @CAPS was from. ""@LOCATION,"" @CAPS replied. ""@CAPS family moved here last @DATE, so I was home schooled until the end of the year,"" @CAPS informed me, her voice laced with nervousness. We continued to make small talk as our group took a tour through the building. I still had not learned her name though because I couldn't read the handwriting on her name tag, and I was too embarrassed to ask what it was. Fortunately @CAPS started talking about her name. ""@CAPS parents named me @PERSON because @CAPS mom is @CAPS, and I guess @CAPS really liked that name."" @CAPS shrugged and rolled her eyes. @CAPS told me I could call her by her nickname, @PERSON, because @CAPS didn't like people talking to her using her full name.  After our tour, all the groups of students headed back to the @ORGANIZATION, for we were going to @CAPS a pizza party for lunch. As @PERSON and I sat in the corner munching on our food, we studied the kids around us. ""@CAPS...This is going to be the worst year ever,"" I said gloomily. We stared pitifully at each other for a moment, sizing up the difficult times ahead of us. Then, simultaneously, we both cracked a smile. Next thing I knew, we were laughing hysterically, our bodies rocking back and forth with every breathe that managed to escape our lips.  Sometimes, when life throws me lemons, instead of making lemonade, I pucker up @CAPS lips at the thought of how sour they are, and I @CAPS @CAPS to @CAPS. Although laughing did not automatically make @CAPS new @ORGANIZATION a fun and welcoming place, it made it @CAPS a little more bearable.

12713,21289,8," I once learned something very valuable in school. I didn't learn it in a class room, or even form a book. I learned this lesson in a hallway near the copy room. One @MONTH be prompted to ask, what kind of lesson could you possibly learn in a hall? All I will tell you is this, it's not one I'll be forgetting any time soon.  In order to completely understand what exactly I was doing roaming the halls and learning lessons, you're going to need a little bit of background. I was in my third period class; which was leadership at the time. Leadership isn't really your conventional class from the perspective of an outsider. Kids running about the school like loose mice @MONTH give off an appearance of impropriety, but an appearance is all it was. We weren't doing anything bad, it's just that most of the time you would have to leave the class room in order to do what needed to be done that day. Leadership directly preceded myleast favorite class of the day, @CAPS @CAPS. I simply detested that class. I had been in @CAPS classes ever since I was in kindergarten at @ORGANIZATION. I was a sophomore at the time and that language had been bugging me for the past ten years. It wasn't that I was bad at it or anything because really, I wasn't. I just had a strong contempt for @CAPS class. The teacher always gave me a hard time, probably because I had a big mouth and I tended to talk a lot. She was that type of person who had @CAPS posture and was a stickler for the rules. The the type of person you could see wielding a yard stick as a deadly weapon.  In leadership that specific class period, the teacher was taking a particularly long time explaining what we were supposed to do that day. He sometimes did this, he was famous for being long winded. He could take the entire @NUM minute class period just talking about an assignment that would have taken ten minutes to do. That day however, we weren't doing an assignment. At least not what a normal person would consider to be your typical assignment. Another girl from the class, @CAPS; and myself were working on a special project. We had to retrieve something very important from my car. We waited for the teacher to finish talking and asked if we could go, he said yes. We walked out the double doors of the classroom and into the main hallway, we then proceeded on down toward the parking lot. As we were walking we passed by the office doors, the @CAPS hall, and the library. Just as we were about to walk by the copy room door, I saw @PERSON. @PERSON was in my @CAPS Two class the year before and I thought that I would say hi to him. I did, I then asked if he was taking @CAPS @CAPS that year. He replied with a no. I told him, ""@CAPS thing, because @CAPS @CAPS sucks!"" I didn't know it at the time, but I would be eating those words by the truck load in just a short while. Not five seconds after I had said that to @PERSON, @CAPS was tugging on my shirt sleeve trying to get me out of the building. I told her to calm down and that it was rude to interrupt people when they are talking.  After I had said bye to @PERSON, @CAPS hurried me out the door and she burst into laughter. I was taken-aback by her sudden outburst of laughter and questioned her as to what she was laughing about. It was right then that @LOCATION, my @CAPS teacher, poked her head out the door and said to me in her thick accent, ""@PERSON, I hear you don't like my class!"" I must have been as red as a tomato. I just stood there with the dumbest look on my face. The kind of look that jumps on your face when you wish you had a rewind button for your mouth. I looked over my right shoulder just in time to see @CAPS gasping for air because she was laughing so hard. I redirected my attention to @LOCATION, she was just standing there with an angry face covering up the laughter that was trying to break through. There I was, not ten steps away from my car and I, for once, had nothing to say. The lesson I learned that day was to never insult an alligator until you've crossed the river. Or at least make sure the alligator isn't in the next room. Especially if the alligator teaches your next class. ",23,26,0.0,49,0.0,0.0,0.0,49.0
12714,21290,8," Laughter is a Element of @CAPS  Laughter is a huge element of @CAPS, without laughter @CAPS wouldn't be what it is today. Laughing is actually a element of why I am in my relationship with my boyfriend as of right now. I also believe ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" Someone once said. Laughter also breaks the ice with people either when their mad, sad, or just meeting the person. Also laughter can bring two people very close together. Here is a true story about how laughter is a element of @CAPS. One day while I was with my best friend @PERSON, we met up with her cousin @CAPS friend's @PERSON and @PERSON. @PERSON and I started talking and hanging out a lot that night. I'm a very shy person but he kept making me laugh. This is no love story but he making me laugh broke the wall I had put up because I was shy and very uncomfortable. The more we laughed together the more closer i felt to him and comfortable I was around him. Eventually we started dating. Too this day we are still together and we have a very strong relationship because of laughter, if it wasn't for the laughter @PERSON and I would not be as close as we are now. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I believe that because laughter gives you that feeling of security, like the sense that it is okay to be your self around strangers. Laughing makes you feel warm and invited to have fun. Makes you feel like at this moment your bonding with this person. It doesn't make you feel uncomfortable when using laughter for the right reason, for example breaking the ice with someone or just meeting someone that can bring them closer. Breaking the ice with laughter. Meeting someone for the first time can be very uncomfortable for some people making conversation and laughing could do that trick to make them feel not so shy and set back to talking. When I first meet people I am very shy until someone makes me laugh then I am very comfortable. Sometimes making people laugh when they are sad or mad could also bring you very close with someone. But laughter could always push you away from someone. When I was upset about me and my ex fiance breaking up for the first time after year and a half no one for a day or two could make me happy. My best friend @PERSON brought me out to the state fair, being on the rides and laughing with her, brought her and I closer also I was not mad anymore. She broke that anger and hurt inside of me just by laughing. A huge element of @CAPS is laughter, there is no doubt about that. Depending on the persons perspective laughing @MONTH not be a element of @CAPS to them but to me it is. With out the feeling of security when laughing with @PERSON we wouldn't be as close as we are now. With out laughter @PERSON and I wouldn't feel as warm and comfortable as we are together. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Someone once said. @CAPS would be a whole lot different without this element of laughter. ",17,20,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12715,21291,8," My friend @ORGANIZATION received a random phone call in the @TIME. It was his friends from high school there were three of them. The weird thing about that is they haven't talked much since high school. Surprised @ORGANIZATION asked what was going on and how they were doing: assuming they were in jail or something in that matter. Instead the friends replied and told him how they was doing and then told @ORGANIZATION they wanted to go on a road trip. @ORGANIZATION thought to himself ""why the heck are you telling me about this"", and then said cool. what do you need from me? The friend replied saying he needed @ORGANIZATION to plan the trip because they did not have computers and they couldn't read maps. at the end of the phone call @ORGANIZATION finally said he would help and plan the trip out. Then asked the friend were he would want to go for this trip, The friend replied I don't know i wanna see a professional baseball game and were ever @ORGANIZATION land is i would love to go there. A week and a half went by later @ORGANIZATION called his friends back to tell them the plans. Proudly he said after his hard work of planning for them. its a ten day trip for you guys starting in @LOCATION then driving down to @LOCATION's @ORGANIZATION and on the way down and back hit up (watch) a game from all five of the professional baseball teams down in @LOCATION, then go to six flags another amusement park like @ORGANIZATION. The friends replied what do you mean you guys? You are coming with us. @ORGANIZATION was super surprised and told them :you guys haven't talked to me in about five years and then you randomly want to go on a road trip with me he said sounding kind of confused. The friends replied well we need your car and we don't know how to drive and again we don't know how to read maps. Thinking hard about the situation @ORGANIZATION finally caved in and told them yes but then gave conditions. He split up tasks for his friends so he wouldn't be stuck with all of the work.For example he gave one of the guys the task of finding hotels and places to stay, another was finding gas stations, and the other friend had to find all the restaurants they were going to eat at.  The trip had started and for @ORGANIZATION the vacation was much needed and unexpectedly fun and relaxing. At lest for now. Everything was going through and working according to plan they hit up and joyfully watched four of the five baseball games and had a great time, then @ORGANIZATION land went above and beyond expectation, and even six flags was exiting and brought @ORGANIZATION and his friends back to feeling like they were in the good old high school days.The only slight bit of worry for trouble was one of the friends became behind on his task of finding hotels and places to stay for everyone. the friend had the nights were they stayed at a relatives or friends lived mostly setup. but for the hotels they were kind of last minuet. Last few days before heading back plans were still going accordingly.They just had one more event. the giants baseball game, then stay with there old high school buddy who moved down to @LOCATION. making sure they would have a place to stay for sure @ORGANIZATION asked the friend in charge of finding places to stay. The friend replayed with a""no i haven't talked to him yet. i will call him later.""this made @ORGANIZATION a little uneasy, so he told his friend no call him now.the friend did.There other friend picked up to bring bad news he was back in @LOCATION. @ORGANIZATION thought to him self I knew this trip was to good to be true. On the @TIME of the baseball game things felt rushed. @ORGANIZATION and his friends had to leave really early because the traffic in @LOCATION is so random and bad. Mean while @ORGANIZATION for got to use the restroom and two hours into the trip to the giants game things started to take a bad turn. @ORGANIZATION had to go bad. But his friends kept him going saying the traffic is good we need to keep going. which @ORGANIZATION listened and kept going. Then traffic came to a stand still. @ORGANIZATION was going to go in his pants!so he pulled off and drove down the side of the high way surprised he didn't get pulled over he miraculously ended up at giants stadium then he saw a portable potty he pulled over and raced to it,it was locked. @ORGANIZATION looked around and saw another one. he takes off as fast as he could for it. And yes it was open finally @ORGANIZATION thought to him self ecstatically! he stepped inside but then looking at the urinal he realizes he didn't get there fast enough and embarrassingly he went in his pants.",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12716,21292,8," Laughter can change any situation. It can be used to break the awkward silence after a bad joke is told, to reminisce about a fond memory, or to clear ones head and create the feeling of calmness. In @DATE opinion laughter is a form of communication. I discovered this through the coarse of the @DATE through many different situations. Many of the experiences were with people who spoke different languages or young children who I was able to connect with through laughter.  One of @DATE experiences with laughter has been with the many different exchange students that @DATE family has hosted. We have gotten exchange students from @LOCATION, @LOCATION, and @LOCATION. Most of them have rather good broken @CAPS, but there were some words that proved difficult to describe and translate.  @DATE favorite exchange students was @PERSON, a student from @LOCATION. She lives in the northern part of the @LOCATION, in the @LOCATION country. In the @LOCATION country they speak @CAPS and @LOCATION and culture is slightly different form the rest of @LOCATION. What made @PERSON so enjoyable was her cheerful personality, her empathy, and her ability to make anyone in the room genuinely burst in to fits of laughter. I believe that this incredible ability of her's was one of the reasons that the summers I spend with her are some of @DATE happiest memories.  @PERSON could turn any activity into a lighthearted experience. I would do tasks with her like washing the dishes, a chore I didn't usually enjoy, and the entire time we would guffaw at the most outrageous things. Together we would laugh until tears were streaming from our eyes and we felt the need to go to the bathroom.  Once @PERSON, @DATE best friend @PERSON, and I spent an entire day laying in the grass at a park putting on ridiculous skits for each other, and telling comical stories, laughing until our bellies hurt. Between out bursts of laughter @PERSON would exclaim ""@CAPS you have got to stop this or I will surely explode, I have to use the restroom every ten minutes!"" @CAPS she would say this we would look at each other and be back to rolling on the ground laughing.  When I went to visit @PERSON in @LOCATION we had many similar situations of outrageous, uncontrollable laughter. One day we went to the @LOCATION parliament building with our families, @PERSON, her sister @CAPS, @DATE sister @PERSON, and I couldn't stop acting goofy and cracking up. We toured through the serious quiet building unable to be silent or stoic, laughing at each other uncontrollably, making funny faces and dancing around, unable to contain our joy.  I don't know @PERSON @CAPS well @CAPS @DATE friends back home, but I think I will always feel a deeper connection to her then most people because with her I feel the free ability to laugh at every and anything. I have heard many different facts about laughter; if you laugh before an exam you will do better on it, moments of laughter are more prominent in your memories, and a person that laughs daily is more likely to feel less stressed and have a happier @DATE, but the reason that I love to laugh is that it makes me feel really fantastic.",25,25,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0

12719,21295,8," It has been said that ""Laughter is the spark of the soul."" I agree with this statement wholeheartedly. Laughter can do wonders for the soul; it truly does ignite a spark. And once that spark has been ignited watch out, it will burn like a wild fire. As the fire burns it will go on a rampage throughout the the body. First its that uncontrollably smile that brings an ache to your cheeks, then the butterflies that marvelously flutters through your stomach, next comes the tingling sensation deep within your toes, and last but not least the tears of joy come streaming from your eyes. Had these feelings before? That'@CAPS the rampage I'm talking about; let the fire burn.  Laughter is an extraordinary thing--it can turn an awkward or embarrassing situation into a much more relaxed one. Unfortunately, in my story about laughter I wasn't the one laughing...About three weeks ago while my sister was at gymnastics, my mom, my best friend @CAPS, and I went to visit my grandparents and to see how the work on our new barn was progressing. After spending sometime at their house it was time to pick up my sister, @CAPS. My grandpa ever so kindly offered to go pick her up but then I mentioned that @CAPS and I could go do it. As we were driving to town in my grandpas @LOCATION, everything seemed fine; just another ordinary day. After we had arrived at the gymnastics center we headed inside and waited for @PERSON to finish. However, as we were walking out my sister said she was hungry and asked me to stop at @ORGANIZATION. I pulled up to the order board and ordered her food. The lady then asked me to drive around to the first window to pay. After doing as she asked, I received my change, put the truck in drive, and began pulling forward--when all of the sudden I heard a loud crunch! My heart dropped as I looked in my side mirror. I hadn't pulled out far enough and had hit the side of the building.  Now before I go on I just want you to know that I have been driving since I was about seven and am usually a very good driver. But hey, that first crash happens to all of us, right? Well back to my story, as I was driving back to my grandparents house it took everything I had not to cry. After we arrived back at their house @CAPS and I ran into the house and got a cup of hot water, soap, toothbrushes, and a @CAPS.O.@CAPS. pad. We scrubbed and scrubbed until all the red paint from the side of the the building was gone. The dent didn't look so bad once the paint was gone and the truck was back to white. I was absolutely terrified to tell my grandparents about the truck! After waiting about an hour I finally got up the courage to tell them what had happened. My grandpa put on his shoes and we went out to look at the damage. As I started crying because I felt so bad, my grandpa just started laughing and reminding me that it was just a truck and it can be fixed.The fact that he just laughed really made the situation a lot less stressful. Laughter brings people together and creates bonds that will last a lifetime.

We were so excited about it that that's all we could talk about. This would be the first camping trip we had been on without our parents. It would be the best four days of our lives. Sand, the beach, friends, quads, no parents; how could it possibly get any better than that?  We invited as many people as we could think of. The more people that were there, the more fun it would be. @ORGANIZATION and I did all the shopping the day before. We got lots of yummy stuff to make. After we got home from shopping we had to load all the bikes in the toy hauler. We each took two bikes, and we took @ORGANIZATION's boyfriends bikes over so he could just drive over after work. We were up almost all night packing, trying to figure out the perfect outfits to wear each day. It was going to be a nice weekend at the coast, we could already tell. It was the middle of @DATE, the sun was shining and it was beautiful outside. The next morning we got up and double checked everything to make sure we had the most important things like flags, helmets, clothes, and those sorts of things. Then it was off to get gas and finally head to the coast! Once we got on the road the music was blaring and the windows were down, just like always. The trip there seemed to take forever because we were so excited to get there. When we finally did get there, there was a really cute guy setting up his tent in one of our camp sights. I asked @ORGANIZATION who he was and @CAPS told me it was @CAPS (her boyfriend) best friend, @PERSON. We parked the toy hauler and got out to unload and he came over to help. The second I layed my eyes on him, I knew he had to be mine. In the next hour or so we got all unloaded and set up. By then many more people had shown up.We helped everyone else get all their things unpacked and set up so we could go on a ride. Our first trip out on the sand was absolutely perfect. It was warm enough to ride in t-shirts. We didn't stay out for long though. People started to get hungry so we went back to camp, made dinner and sat around the fire. There was probably twenty or so of us sitting around the fire, talking about everything from the stars in the sky, to the sand on the ground. Every time I would look up I noticed that @PERSON was looking at me. He would just smile, and look away like it was nothing at all. As usual, @ORGANIZATION started telling us about a funny incident that had happened to her in the @DATE ( @CAPS was such a klutz.)We all started laughing as @CAPS was showing us her bruises from falling down the stairs. @PERSON and i locked eyes.  Later that night @PERSON asked me if I wanted to go on a walk. We walked all the way on the sand trail out to the dunes, and all the way to the top of a giant dune called @CAPS @CAPS. When we got to the top we sat there, staring at the stars, talking. We realized we had lots of things in common. We liked to do all the same things, and we had the ability to make each other laugh.   Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. If you can make someone laugh, it means a lot. No one has ever been able to make me laugh the way that he does. I never knew that laughing could bring two people together the way that it did that one night at the dunes..",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12721,21297,8,"  It all started at the play ground @CAPS me my friend @PERSON and @PERSON were just sitting around and we saw these two girls walk up and it was these girls from school @PERSON and @CAPS. We didn't know who it was at first so we sat back all cool like tell i noticed it was them @CAPS they got closer. They ran up and said ""hey guys want to go on a adventure to the woods"" ""sure why not"" we all said ""we ain't got nothing better to do so we walked which seemed like @NUM miles @CAPS it was only @NUM feet from the play ground it felt like a long way either way i was lazy at the time.  @CAPS we got into the @CAPS it had a lot of bushes and trees that we thought we could make a fort out of bushes and chill and eat donuts from @ORGANIZATION there but what we didn't know was there was something living in that @CAPS that we were not aware of. Turns out we went into the wrong @CAPS and there was a lot of animals in the place we went into. So as i was sitting on the long by the creek i saw a brownish figure walk by deep into to the woods them closet person to me was @PERSON and i jumped up and grabbed her and from there i knew were going on adventure to go find whatever was living out there. @CAPS we started walking all i could see was trees and bushes tell i heard @PERSON say ""there is something over there by the big tree with vines so we approached the tree with caution not knowing what was going to happen. We stood behind a little fallen over log that was there for awhile.As we watched the big tree and the huge hollow hole that was in the side of it we heard a loud growling nose from inside the tree i got up from behind the tree and went over to check it out but before i could take a step @PERSON grabbed my jacket and told it look to dangerous ""alright"" i said with disappointment cause i really want to go see what was in that tree. We started walking back to get the others turns out they have been looking for us for over @NUM minutes ""sorry"" we both said"" but you guys have to check this out @CAPS so narly"" i said with animosity. ""@CAPS what is it"" @PERSON said ""don't know but it sounds big and scary and mean"" said @PERSON "" ""oh daaanngg"" @PERSON said ""i think were gonna die if we got back over there"" @CAPS complained. ""@CAPS gonna be just fine"" i said so we all looked at each other alright everyone said in a scared voice. ""@CAPS is gonna be alright trust me i know a spot were we can watch the tree without getting close to the animal or whatever is in there""I said   @CAPS we were walking down there to go see the animal @CAPS didn't want to go see the animal anymore so we argued for a little bit then we all came to a agreement that @PERSON and @CAPS stay up the hill a little ways and we will run back if anything is wrong. We got behind the tree and watched the tree me @PERSON and @PERSON didnt know what to see or wait for @CAPS something would come out of that tree.  I could not wait any longer it was begining to take forever then i got up and said ""lets go see what is in that tree"" ""im with you so lets @NUM said. We walking around the tree keeping our distance @CAPS we heard that growling noise again we backed off a little bit but kept going we got a little bit closer @CAPS i saw something some out of the tree. It was a huge mountain loin we ran as fast as we could up the hill. I was looking back trying to follow the sound of screaming from @LOCATION but @CAPS i looked up it was really @PERSON i could not help laughing @CAPS we got @PERSON and @CAPS i kept laughing all the way to @ORGANIZATION. As soon as we got into @ORGANIZATION we were all out of breath especially me cause i could not stop laughing about @PERSON and how i thought he was @PERSON cause he was screaming like a girl. ""@CAPS up"" he said ""that wasn't me it was @PERSON"" even though @PERSON was running beside me the hole time. We walked into a little more into @ORGANIZATION and there was a big box of donuts sitting right by the deli and we ran over there and got two box's which had a total of @NUM donuts in them then we got a big gallon of soda and chilled in @ORGANIZATION and ate the hole thing in @NUM minutes. I will always remember that day as one of the craziest days of my life. ",15,17,0.0,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.0
12722,21298,8,"  One stormy winter night my girlfriend and I wanted to go to dinner, so we did. When we got there the restaurant was almost full so we got a table fast. While waiting for food we started talking about our friends and having a good time. I then said something really mean about someone she knew and did not know it. She got really upset and stormed out of the place leaving me alone. I finally got up and went home after paying to bill for the food I did not eat.  The next mourning I got up and started cleaning up the house, mowing the yard and doing all my chores. She came over to my house and apologized for what she did, so I apologized for saying something mean about one of her friends. I told her that I will call her after my chores where done and go out for lunch. Finally I finished the chores, took a shower, and got dressed. I then called her and told her to meet me at the restaurant of her choice.   About an hour later she shows up finds me waiting for at the table farthest from the door. She then sat down and asked if I was going to be mean again. I said that I will be nice and considerate today and not be mean. I then proceeded to tell her about a funny memory. She laughed and tell told me one. This went on until we left. Up until she broke up with me for my friend, laughter was to one thing that held us together.",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12723,21299,8," Laughter is said that it is the medicine for happiness. Those who laugh frequently end up having an overall better life. They are in better moods throughout the @DATE and affect people around them with their upbeat mood. Many solid friendships involve laughing frequently. I am lucky to have friends that never cease to make me or each other laugh. Their was one time when we all laughed intently at my house late at @TIME.  My freshmen in high school was my second year total in public school because I was previously home schooled by my parents. I just established friendships with four other people earlier that year. They were my friends @PERSON, @PERSON, @PERSON, and @PERSON. None of us ever been to eachother's houses yet, so I suggested to be the first one to all have them over on a @DATE. We did not know yet exactly what we wanted to do at my house, but we knew with our creativity we could find anything to entertain us. As they came over one by one we watched football on the @CAPS until the entire gang was at the house. Once the last person, @PERSON, came to my house we all went outside to find something to do. All of us are football players so we decided to play some backyard football. Unfortunately all of us were linemen except for @PERSON. The problem was that we had what is called ""linemen hands"" which means that we could not catch a football due to having hard hands. This created quite a spectacle of a bunch of linemen trying to be wide receivers. We ended up not finishing the game because it was way to funny.  Later that @TIME we all decide to grab the immense amount of junk around my property ,and like most boys our age, started to fight with them. This battle continued for most the @TIME and people got hit in the funniest of ways. After we were all tired from the running around we decided to make scary movie with my mom's video camera. This is when the most laughter of the whole @TIME came. We all sat down to make out a plot for our movie and kept distorting it in different ways to come to some agreement on what to base it off of. We decided to make the movie seem like it was off of ""@CAPS-field"", a movie about aliens invading earth, but we replaced the aliens with a psychopath chasing us. As we began the movie all seemed like it was following the script perfectly. Unfortunately we found out that we could not act at all when the first serious scene came up. @PERSON was supposed to be on the ground with a gash down his side when we found him, but when we filmed that scene @PERSON, who was supposed to be unconscious, could not keep a straight face when we found him. Since he had a goofy smile when we picked him up and with the awkwardly said line from @PERSON ""The window is open, @PERSON is gone"" we all started to burst out laughing. After we calmed down we went to film the next scene where we wake @PERSON up and try to find out what happened. @PERSON said ""I'm hurt really bad! I think I need an ambulance"" and then @PERSON responded ""@CAPS that's not gonna happen!"". That line that @PERSON said was not in the script and was just way to funny to keep it in and in a result we all started bursting out laughing once again. We tried to redo the scene, but when I said ""@CAPS are you laughing"" we all burst right back into uncontrollable laughing. Later in the movie the last guys alive were @PERSON, @PERSON, and me. We were casing the psychopath outside in the pitch-black dark. Randomly @PERSON and @PERSON run in front of the camera when they were not supposed to. This caused us to laugh yet again because of the way the short fat one ran. After all the scenes were done and we finished the movie, we all went back into my living room, spooked from being outside in the dark for so long making a scary movie. My sister randomly comes home without us noticing. She stares through the locked front door with out making a sound in a very creepy way until we all notice her. We all jumped about ten feet in the air due to being extremely scared. After we settled down we all joined in the laughing once again as we looked back and saw how stupid we were.  In conclusion, the laughing that went on throughout @TIME made us closer as friends. Every time we get together at my house we look at that tape and remember the good times and laugh until we cry. The benefit of laughter in my life was being able to create a strong bond with now my best friends. My life is truly blessed that way. END ",20,21,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0
12724,21300,8," Bright blue waves of morning light streamed over the hill tops as the waking sun began to rise to its daily position. The crisp, chill air arose the slumbering birds. Soon, the dusk setting transformed into a vibrant morning where the birds chattered with their mellifluous tone of song. Gentle breezes swept through the trees causing the leaves to dance. The green grass appeared to flow like an ocean while the cracked gravestones remained stationary; just as anchored ships at sea. Any spectator @MONTH agree that this particular graveyard scene presents a prodigious feeling; however, when one is to catch a glimpse of the stoical man who stands before the silent tombstone, the spectator's heart fills with empathy and despair. Motionless, young @PERSON stood before the tombstone. The gentle, but quick breeze began to accelerate into a harsh wind. @PERSON's teary eyes and wet face began to dry. Although the windy weather was not uncommon for @PERSON, @LOCATION, a long lost memory interrupted @PERSON's thought for an unknown reason. For a split moment, his mind drifted back to sixteen years ago when @CAPS was still alive. His eyes closed as the wind began to calm. He could nearly hear her voice.  ""@CAPS, I would like you to meet someone,"" @CAPS yelled from upstairs. It was @DATE, and six-year-old @PERSON came zealously running up the stairs. Breathing rapidly, he arrived at the top of the creaky stair case and skipped to his parent's room. ""@CAPS @CAPS?"" he asked as he began to turn the cold, brass door knob. He opened the door just a crack and peered into the room. His blue eyes sparkled with curiosity. He observed how the mid-wife gracefully glided to his mother's bedside to prop her head up with another pillow. His attention then altered to his father who was sitting on the edge of the bed cradling a small bundle of pink blankets. ""@CAPS hello to your new baby sister,""said @PERSON's mother. Still clutching the brass knob, @PERSON pushed open the door with the palm of his left hand. The door moaned as @PERSON began to place the tip of his @CAPS light-up sneaker onto the roan colored carpet in his parent's bedroom. Carefully and cautiously, he advanced to the foot of his parent's bed where his father sat. He stood in front of his father with wide eyes. ""@CAPS was born less that an hour ago,"" said his father. @PERSON then looked to the heap of pink blankets. He nervously reached out his clammy hand and gently pinched the top layer of blankets to uncover the face of his little sister. All was silent except for the wind outside. Inch-by-inch, he slowly began to peal back the top blanket; but, before @PERSON could even finish this task, the new-born baby let out a startling exhale. @PERSON lurched back and slammed against the bedroom door. His father jumped because of @PERSON's reaction, but was careful no to wake the baby. @PERSON felt as if his heart was about to jump out of his chest. Wide-eyed and out of breath, he looked to his mother. To @PERSON's surprise, he found his mother quite amused. The corners of her moth began to curl up and a slight giggle leaked out. Soon enough, both his parents were immersed in a hypnotic laughter; their bodies shaking rhythmically. @PERSON began to relax and smiled at this mother. ""@CAPS @CAPS scare you a little?"" @CAPS asked. His father chimed in, I would think so!"" The three of them laughed for the next five minutes while the mid-wife simply smiled and the baby lay sound asleep in the strong arms of her father.  @PERSON could feel the overwhelming essence of reality rushing back to him; just as the wind flowed through his brown hair. He missed her. He cried for her. He wished @CAPS could of won the ferocious battle fought between the human body and cancer; but, @CAPS didn't. Now @CAPS was gone. He would never see his mother on @LOCATION again. Although this memory succeeded in bringing him sadness, it failed to push @PERSON into depression. Instead, he suddenly recalled an ancient saying: ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS then, @PERSON suddenly realized how unbelievably close he was to his precious mother. He possessed eight years of memories made with his mother and many of these memories involved laughter. @PERSON tilted his head to the sun as tears of joy rushed down his face. Now he understood the fact that love is never dependent on time. Granted, he only knew his mother for a small chapter of his life; however, the memories made and laughter shared still continues to engulf @PERSON with his mother's love.   In my mind, @PERSON is classified as a superior individual. As I am his only full sister, he never fails to educate me of his past memories with our mother. I love her and miss her, but know I will see her again someday; and when I do, we will be bound together with joy and laughter. ",23,21,0.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.0,44.0

12726,21302,8," We all understand the benefits of laughter. I believe that laughter is an important part of life that everybody should experience. The time that I remember most where I have laughed and enjoyed myself was when my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION in @LOCATION.It all started with @DATE. We were opening our presents when my @CAPS and @CAPS told me and my siblings that they had one last present for us but it was a surprise; in order to know what it was we had to find it. So they told us as a hint, that it was someplace that we sleep. As soon as they told us that I knew exactly where to look, our bedrooms. So we raced up the stairs to our bedrooms and looked around. To our delight, sitting on our nightstands where four packets full of info about @ORGANIZATION. We were so excited and happy. My little sister said that it was the best @DATE present ever. We ran down the stairs, hugged @CAPS and @CAPS, and told them that they are the best @CAPS and @CAPS ever. What made it even better was that we would miss school. Then we found out that the trip was scheduled for the month of @DATE. So we had to wait for four months. Those four months were the longest of my life. Four months later it was finally time to go. We had to wake up around @NUM a.m because our plane was scheduled to depart at @TIME. Before we left our house I asked my @CAPS if I could bring my @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS with me so that I was not bored on the plane. She told me that I could, only if I share it with my little brother. Once we had finally left home I started feeling like I had butterflies in my stomach. I guess it was because something fun and exciting was about to happen to me. When we got to the airport it was @NUM so we had about an hour and fifty-five minutes till the plane left. Luckily I had my @CAPS @CAPS. Since my brother was only six years old he easily gets bored, I let him play my @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS till we had to board. When it was finally time to board one of my sisters had to use the restroom. My @CAPS ended up taking her while my @CAPS stayed with us and boarded the plane .My other sister did not like that my @CAPS was not on the plane with us yet. So my @CAPS told me to keep my brother and sister in their seats while he went o find my @CAPS and sister. Five minutes later they all came back, and just in time too. The plane had just finished refueling and we were on the way to the runway. One of my favorite parts of being on a plane is when it's speeding down the runway at amazing speed. And when we finally reached the speed we needed to be at, we launched in to the air and my stomach felt like it was in the open air. My little brother is holding on to my hand so tight that his little knuckles turn white. It gave me the impression that he was scared so I told him to just think about it as a really fast car that goes over a bump. That seemed to help a lot because he started laughing when the plane left the ground. He said that it was fun and wanted to do it again. I reminded him that once we got to @ORGANIZATION we would go on all the rides that we want. Three hours later we arrived in @LOCATION, @LOCATION. Once we got off the plane we went to pick up our bags from the baggage claim. My @CAPS went to see when the next @CAPS @CAPS was scheduled to arrive. As he came back the @CAPS was just coming down the road. The @CAPS was blue with @CAPS characters. The driver showed us a lot of cool things and places. The @CAPS that we were staying in was called The @CAPS @CAPS. It had a huge pool shaped like a guitar. Once we were settled in we went in to @LOCATION. It was really fun because my sisters and I got all the @CAPS characters autographs and pictures. My favorite one was @CAPS because he reminds me of myself. We got to stay in the park for about three hours when we started getting hungry so we left and went back to the @CAPS. After dinner we went down to the pool to go swimming. It seemed to be funner than @ORGANIZATION because in the week we were there we spent more time laughing and swimming down by the pool than actually in @LOCATION. That is the best time that I had ever had in my life and I owe it all to my parents. I love them very much. Thank you.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12727,21304,8," My best friend and I have been friends since third grade. We've shared many laughs, memories, and tears, yet to this day we're still closer than ever. One of the key reasons we've been able to stay friends for so long is because we make each other laugh. We joke around and we make any boring time into a good one. This is the story of how our relationship came to be and some of the reasons why we are still best friends. It started in third grade. I was walking alone on the playground when she asked me to play with her, having nothing else to do, I agreed. We played for the whole recess, and it eventually became a regular thing for us to spend recess together. The first time she invited me to her house, I was kind of nervous. I was afraid it was going to be awkward, or that we wouldn't have a good time. When we got to her house after school, we went to her room, played video games for a little bit, and then we had a snack. We brought our crackers to her room, sat on the ground, and started to eat. Out of no where we just looked at each other, and we started laughing like crazy. They weren't little giggles either, we laughed so hard it brought tears to our eyes. From that day forward we hung out as often as we could. A couple of years went by, we hung out more often, and declared ourselves best friends. When fifth grade came around, we were glued to the hip. Her dad was our teacher, so he already knew how close we both were. We never really got to sit next to each other, but we still managed to talk a lot. One day at recess we were joking around and she said your butt is so big, you're going to break a chair. These days it doesn't seem that funny, but in fifth grade it was hilarious. When we got inside we played this math game, I got the question wrong so I plopped down in my chair, sure enough, it broke. Other kids that heard what she said laughed, but no one really quite laughed as much as we both did.  Fifth grade was also when boys started coming into the picture. During @DATE break she really liked this one guy, and when he said he didn't like her, she was completely broken. That night she came over to talk with me about it, but we never ended up talking about it at all. Instead, we watched funny movies and I would do things on purpose to make her laugh. Even though we were already really close, that night made us grow even closer. At the end of fifth grade we had a little graduation ceremony. Towards the end they put on a slide show of everyone in the fifth grade class. One of the pictures was of @PERSON and I with mud masks on, we were both embarrassed, but we also laughed because we had a lot of fun that night, and we wondered how the picture got on the slide show. After the ceremony @PERSON and I threw a party. We shared many laughs and still that made us grow even closer, even though we had made new friends that night, our bond was unbreakable. Middle school was a whole new experience. New friends, different classes, and more drama. I hate to say it, but we grew apart those three years. We had none of the same classes and we both met new people, but every time I went over to her house, or every time we hung out, we laughed till we were crying, and gasping for air. A lot of things happened, our different friends fought, some of them moved, but our ability to make each other laugh kept us together through thick and thin. Towards the end of our middle school lives, we grew closer again, and things were pretty much back to normal.  Today @PERSON and I are as close as we were in fifth grade if not closer. When we are together not only do we make ourselves laugh, but we make other people laugh as well. We are together almost every weekend, and we @MONTH not do much, but we always end up laughing like crazy. Doing cheer, we also spend even more time together. Other things in our relationship are important too, like trust, loyalty, and kindness, but laughter is what has kept us together through everything we have been through. Laughter is also the reason we have become friends in the first place and I am happy to call her my best friend. Without her, my life would be very boring, and I hope we stay friends for the rest of our lives. Laughing keeps people together and makes relationships grow stronger. This was an example of how it helped me and my best friend become friends and stay friends through everything life has thrown at us.",17,20,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0

We're @NUM years apart in age @CAPS from the way we act, @CAPS'd think we were twins. @CAPS @CAPS matter how close we are, we still are siblings, and we still fight. Usually they're just petty little fights that we get over in a matter of seconds, @CAPS this one was one @CAPS could not back down from. I beat him at @CAPS tennis. @CAPS was a warm afternoon, and me and @CAPS brother had just gotten back from school. We usually relax for a little before we do our homework by challenging each other at playing @CAPS.  ""@CAPS cheated."" @CAPS said firmly. ""@CAPS I didn't!"" I snapped back. I could tell that @CAPS was getting really upset about this, @CAPS I didn't care. I wasn't going to let him win this one. ""@CAPS yes @CAPS did. @CAPS always do! @CAPS's not fair."" ""@CAPS I didn't this time."" @CAPS was telling the truth. There are times when I cheat by distracting him during a game, @CAPS I won fair and square. ""@CAPS're just mad because @CAPS lost. Get over yourself and take @CAPS like a man."" That's all I had to say to make him throw down his controller and make him run upstairs crying. ""@CAPS! What did @CAPS do to your brother?"" @CAPS mom yelled. ""@CAPS beat him at a game and now @CAPS's mad."" I knew @CAPS would do that. @CAPS and report me to @CAPS mom hoping that she would save him and get me in trouble. ""@CAPS @CAPS's just a game. @CAPS can't win every time."" ""@CAPS's just not fair!"" @CAPS said before slamming the door of his room. Sweet, sweet victory. I love when I win. @CAPS makes me feel superior. @CAPS of course that little feeling of guilt of making your little brother cry came over me, so I went to @CAPS and apologize. ""@CAPS?"" I knocked on his door. ""I'm sorry for making @CAPS cry. @CAPS's just a game though. @CAPS win some and @CAPS lose some. Don't be mad."" I gave the most heart-felt apology I could think of at the moment. ""@CAPS away. I don't want to talk to @CAPS."" @CAPS away?! I walked all the way upstairs to tell him I was sorry for something that I didn't even need to say sorry for, and @CAPS tells me to @CAPS away? Oh @CAPS. @CAPS. @CAPS. @CAPS. After processing what had just happened all that could come out of @CAPS mouth was, ""@CAPS."". And I walked off.  The rest of the day went on. We passed each other many times without even acknowledging one another. I couldn't believe that @CAPS was this upset about @CAPS. @CAPS was probably one of the longest periods of times @CAPS didn't talk to me by choice. I started feeling really bad, even sad that @CAPS wasn't talking to me. I decided to try talking to him again. Only problem was, @CAPS was downstairs playing the @CAPS again and I was upstairs this time. I came out of @CAPS room and started to walking down the stairs. @CAPS could hear me coming, so @CAPS turned down the volume of the @CAPS.  ""@CAPS listen. Are @CAPS really not going to talk to me over a game I-"" @CAPS! All of a sudden, I was sliding down the stairs. ""@CAPS!"" @CAPS was laughing at me! I landed at the bottom of the staircase and started to laugh too. We were both laughing! That's all we needed to start up conversation again. Just a little laugh.",20,26,46.0,46,0.0,0.0,0.0,46.0

Some examples of people that dont really laugh anymore is probably a person that lost someone close to them or that just doesnt have anybody to tell jokes with in my opinion you have to have someone to share stuff with or that will tell you jokes when your in a really bad mood.I always used to remember my mom telling my little brother an i to quiet sown whaen we would talk in the family table during dinner one day. One day i went to school and i went into health class it was weird because the teacher was talking about how we should share stuff in the dinner table and have some laughing moments. So when i got home a told my mother all about what the teacher had taught us during health class. She said ok and we tried it .It really was a good experience we were all laughing telling jokes all the time and since then we tell jokes in the family table. It really does give you some energy sometimes but at the same time if you laugh way too much your stomach will eventually start hurting.Like i told you in the first paragraph theres many different ways you can laugh for example if you watch a comody show i very good idea would be @PERSON that show always mekes me crack up sometimes my mom thinks im crazy. Or ever family @CAPS thats such a great show to watch wene your really in a bad mood. Another way to make someone laugh is telling jokes theres the knock knock shows and then theres the guess what i am jokes . but one way your really going to make somebody really laugh is tikling that always works theres no way you cant ever make someone laugh. Eather have someone always do it for you because i know that you cant do it to yourself that would be really weird or have a @CAPS see who laughs first contest.It wont always help you with your problems all the way but it will make you feel good for a little bit it will really make you forget about the bad things for a while. I heard tha t if you laugh alot suposlly you live longer so i think it does help you with your problems.",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12730,21308,8,"During the @DATE I decided to join @ORGANIZATION, I raised a market pig and was determined to sell it at the @LOCATION. Raising a pig was time consuming and hard work. Without patience, great teachers, and having fun I wouldn't have been able to do it. That @DATE I had some great experiences and some of them, not so great. This was my first time being involved with @ORGANIZATION, also my first time raising a pig. I never thought that I would have so many awkward moments. One of my awkward, yet funny moments happened when I was shoveling pig poop with my friend @ORGANIZATION. This was also @ORGANIZATION's first time being involved with @ORGANIZATION and raising a pig. @ORGANIZATION and I were just trying to hurry and get our work finished so that we could go back to our homes and shower. Turns out I was in to much of a hurry. My boots sank into the mud and poop which made me lose my balance, I tried using the shovel to catch my self but it was too late. I was covered in pig poop and mud from head to toe, I had fallen in it. @ORGANIZATION and I looked at each other for what seemed to be two minutes, but was only about six seconds, then we busted out in laughter. After our laughing was under control she helped me get up and we went to go find our agriculture teacher @PERSON.  When @PERSON saw my once blue pants now brown, he couldn't help but laugh at me. He got his camera out and took some picture of me that are very embarrassing but make myself and others smile. After all the joking, laughing, and pictures were finished @PERSON gave some old clothes to wear for my ride home. I had to roll the window down because the car got pretty smelly. When I arrived home, I headed straight for the shower. This is an experience I will never forget. If I didn't have friends around me I don't think I would have thought of the experience as something positive and funny. Because @PERSON and @ORGANIZATION were there to help me and laugh with me, I got some pretty fun memories out of that @DATE raising a pig. Without the laughter it might of been a little negative, I might have been mad, or embarrassed, or sad.

12731,21309,8," Some people say that laughter is the best medicine. I strongly agree with these people, because I believe that any funny situation in which there is laughter can put anyone into a better mood. Just taking the time to laugh at something or yourself is something that every person should do. Having agood time with friends and family and laughing with them is truly something to be greatful for. I have had several situations filled with laughter. @CAPS I am greatful for. My two best friends, @PERSON@NUM, and I, well lets just say there is hardly a time when we are together that there is not laughter involved. So many times we've laughed at ourselves and each other I've lost count. It's so amazing to have these two great friends to laugh along with. There are so many times that we have laughed at eachother I don't even know where to begin. One time we were all at @ORGANIZATION's house and we were playing hide and seek in her back yard. It was my turn to be the seeker. I came out of the house after counting to @NUM. As I searched the yard I found everyoneeventually, except @PERSON. As I wondered the yard looking for her the others started helping me look for her.We could hear her laughter coming from somewhere, but we couldn't tell where. She started talking to us saying things like ""@CAPS here!"" or ""@CAPS way!"". After getting frustrated and giving up, she finally revealed herself...on the roof of her house! We all laughed so hard, not even knowing how she got up there in the firstplace.  Another time we had gone to pizza for my @NUM birthday party. We went into the arcade room with the moneywe had ready to play some games. We told ourselves to avoid the claw machine, because we knew we would not want to stop and waste all of our money. But of course @ORGANIZATION had to try it just once. Next thing we, knewwe were using all of our money trying to win at @CAPS game. We each eventually won something, screaming, cheering, and laughing hysterically like kindergartners. We had also played @CAPS race car game at least ten timesand we were running out of games to play. So to relieve our boredom we started playing the race car game driving with our feet instead of our hands. It was a very fun time.  I couldn't possibly tell all of these stories. That would take hours, days, maybe even weeks. But I can tell youthat laughter is definitely a huge part of our day to day lives. I consider myself a very lucky person to have suchgreat friends that laughter is such a common thing for us. Not a lot of people are fortunate enough to have thisopportunity. A little laughter can go a long way. So the next time you see someone who looks like they need a friend or like they could just use a good laugh, talk to them, attempt to be their friend, make them laugh. The resultwill be its own reward. Trust me.",20,18,0.0,38,0.0,0.0,0.0,38.0
12732,21310,8," I believe that laughter and joy are key elements that bring families and friends together. Being able to be in the company of those who make you laugh, is a greatly valued thing. Sometimes just sitting around and telling old stories, or playing board games can leave you with a sore gut because you have been laughing so hard. Many people these days have become so caught up in their lives and sometimes forget to take a moment and just laugh. I feel sorry for these people because they are missing out on the joy and enlightenment they could be sharing with the people around them. Family vacations are always chaotic, at least in my family, but they always turn out to be a memorable experience one way or another. Every winter our family gets together and goes to @ORGANIZATION to stay in our cabin there. A long weekend full of good food, trips to the mountain, snowball fights and family games, is a great environment to spark some laughter. Every year we bring big family games such as @LOCATION, @CAPS and @LOCATION. My family members and I tend to be very competitive people and the volume of the room in which the game is being played, tends to escalate almost through the roof. The whole house is filled with laughter and funny arguments over things like ""how in the world is that a picture of a sock!"" or ""That's not fair, you know the actual definition!"" I enjoy these times because they are memories that you can hold onto forever. Laughter is a part of happiness, and happiness needs to be a part of life. Spending time with those who make you laugh, are those that are worthy of your time. Wiser people than myself say that ""life is short."" I'm starting to realize that this statement is true. If life is short, then that time should be spent in the best way it can be; moments filled with laughter. ",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12733,21312,8," My boyfriend and I planned to go to the @NUM @CAPS @CAPS fair that they put in @LOCATION, OR. He asked my mom if she would let me go with him to the fair @LOCATION @LOCATION and surprisingly my mom said ""yeah you can go"" i was really exited cause that would be our first @NUM @CAPS @CAPS together. We were thinking of how it would be and we laughed because we were saying ""what if we were on a ride and we fell out,"" but knowing it wouldn't really happen. The day before @NUM @CAPS @CAPS i got all my things ready for that day. i was really exited and nervous cause I've never been on rides like that so i probably didn't go to sleep till @NUM in the @TIME.  @NUM @CAPS @CAPS was on a @DATE, I didn't wanna go to school so my mom let me go to the fair instead of school. I woke up laughing and with a smile on my face because of all the things that were going through my head. I got ready, my boyfriend @PERSON his brother and his sister came to pick me and my friend up around @TIME. We drove to the @CAPS station, parked and got our bus fare. After we got on the @CAPS, we took a seat and we were taking pictures and making jokes. Since we got in the @CAPS it their was nothing but laughter. I'm pretty sure the rest of the passengers thought we were crazy. It took about @NUM minutes to get to were the fair was at, when we got off the @CAPS. We ran to the gates to get our tickets. But it wasn't @NUM so they weren't opened so we had to wait @NUM minutes till they opened the gates. Once we got in this lady was selling a card that had the tokens in it, so we bought it and got on a spider ride which at first didn't look as scary but it moved really fast so i was sliding everywhere. @PERSON and his brother were laughing at me and my friend @ORGANIZATION cause we were yelling but after a couple of seconds i stopped yelling and i ended up laughing for no reason i just laughed and laughed until i finally stopped and we got off. After that ride i wasn't really in the mood of yelling or looking dumb in front of the other people that were at the fair so we didn't get on any for a while until we saw the @ORGANIZATION wheel we got on it. It was fun but it moved a lot so it reminded me of what @PERSON and I were talking about ""that how funny would it be if we fell out."" so i held the pole that was in the middle and @PERSON and them started to laugh so i let go and started laughing to cause the were making weird faces at me. When the ride was over we got off and went to go get something to eat from a tent that they had at the fair that was selling food, drinks and a lot of other things. We all bought a big bean and cheese burrito, @ORGANIZATION, churros and an elephant ear. It was so good we wanted to buy more but we didn't have enough money. So we bought another elephant ear and I was the only one that actually ate all of it. So they started laughing because they we saying ""if you could eat two big elephant ears you could probably eat an entire elephant"" I laughed with then then said ""I bet I could, I'm just playing but these elephant ears are really good so I would eat twenty elephant ears"" they laughed and laughed so i just laughed with them as well. After I got done eating, we walked around the fair looking at the other tents they had. Their was a tent that spray painted your name or whatever you wanted on the shirt or sweater. But the bad thing was that we didn't have enough money for the sweater or for the rides so we just choose to go on all the rides and if we had left over money we would go back to buy a sweater. Then we pasted by a photo booth were they took a picture of you dressed up as if you were a pilgrim. I thought it was funny so i started laughing and my friends started to laugh as well because they didn't know what i was laughing about until i told them. Then they started laughing even more. We got on the last four rides and it was about @TIME we had to leave so we left waited for the @CAPS. As we were waiting for the @CAPS two security guys come on their two horses and I thought its weird seeing horses in the city, we started to laugh.

12734,21315,8,"Laughter: A @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS of the variety of emotions expressed by humans, there are emotions that represent different qualities. While furrowed brows @MONTH be associated with displeasure, anger, or even confusion, laughter is an action connotative to mainly one emotion - happiness. Although emotions are relative aspects of human nature, actions such as laughter exist to transcribe an emotion like happiness into physiological expressions that humans are able to understand. Due to this unique quality as an action, laughter is often a key element in developing relationships. Over the years, I have found that laughter is crucial because of three various reasons - laughter does not separate, it is an ability that all members of the human race have in common, and additionally, it brings down personal barriers. In many aspects, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people""; instances of laughter are @CAPS anecdotes. Unlike sentiments such as jealousy, fury, or sorrow, happiness is an emotion that tends not to separate. While jealousy, fury, and sorrow can cause such discontentment between people to the point of physically and emotionally driving them apart from each other, happiness does no such thing. Happiness is conducive to laughter, and because of this, laughter congregates people together, rather than dispelling them apart.  In addition to its compelling nature, laughter is also a @CAPS action. In a general view, laughter gives humans another point at which they are equal; the ability to laugh is one quality humans share. Even infants, in their states of vulnerable dependency, are able to emit laughter. Laughter is also able to establish starting points for new relationships, because sharing a laugh is akin to establishing commonalities between people. Whether the commonality be a sense of humor, similar experiences, or a surprise, sharing a laugh automatically institutes a link between two or more people. Additionally, while laughter can begin new relationships, it can also solidify them. Often, as laughter is shared through common experiences, having common experiences to laugh about symbolizes a relationship between people in itself. Since laughter is mainly about relationships and interactions between people, it is also about building trust. Establishing connections between one person and another, regardless of how weak the connection might be, requires some form of trust. Laughter is often able to bring down emotional barriers because it requires a sense of kinship and camaraderie. Through laughter, we as humans are able to bring down notions of suspicion or anxiety. As stated before, laughter establishes commonalities and therefore is an activity that exudes a sense of trust and reliability. This razing of emotional barriers is another way in which laughter is able to bring people closer together.  Laughter is a @CAPS action that ""personifies"" how similar members of the human race are. It is astounding how man is able to discern qualities such as reliability and trustworthiness simply through the complex, yet basic, act of sharing a laugh. Through laughter, people are subconsciously able to make emotional connections with their fellow human entities and in doing so, are able to take interaction to an emotional level. Laughter is the true story behind human relationships worldwide. Not only is laughter the @CAPS language, laughter's intimate nature renders it the shortest distance between two people.",20,15,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0

12736,21319,8," The snow shimmered in the sunlight like sequins. @CAPS and I rushed to her bedroom window to get a better look. A blanket of white covered the ground. Quickly we strapped ourselves into air-restricting snowsuits. She opened the wooden front door and the chilly air stung my nose. @CAPS we hurried out into any @NUM graders paradise. @CAPS and I had both been through some rough times in the past few months. I shielded myself from the fact that recently my muscular brown horse was put to death by a giant bolt of light and a loud thunder clap. @CAPS had just learned her parents were getting a divorce. Being best friends, we had been through a trail of tears that year, but all was forgotten when our legs hit the cold wet snow. We raced to her garage in panic to find sleds. As we ran through the house to the back door we were stopped by @CAPS's short tan mom. She refused to let us go outside until we ate breakfast. We chomped down a bowl of the always tasty @CAPS @CAPS and gulped down a tall glass of juice. @CAPS we flew out the back door with our sleds. There the giant hill waited for us. It slopped downward in a perfect @NUM degree angle with only a few turns. The wood piles and thorny blackberry bushes that lined our sledding course taunted us. As my eyes wandered down the path of snow I heard @CAPS yell, ""@CAPS!"" @CAPS I saw her whipping her way down the slope. I grabbed my red racer sled and took off after her. I approached my first turn. It hooked around left like the start of a figure eight. With ease I glided around the corner and saw a snapshot of the woodpile that sat on my right. I looked up to see the old pond at the bottom of the hill. The sun shone through slivers of the trees surrounding it like moonlight dancing on ice.  Confidently I approached my second turn. I spun around the corner sharply. I stared up ahead to see @CAPS's bright blue sled reaching the finish line. That was when my eyes caught a glimpse of her neighbors bay horse and all my happiness floated away. As I got lost in my thoughts about @LOCATION, I also lost focus. My shoulders hit the snow as if it were concrete. My legs tangled into knots and I could feel my head pounding. The sled had abandoned me. I tumbled down the hill like an avalanche. Eventually, the kind hands of a blackberry bush reached out to stop me. The thorns stabbed my neck. Carefully, I plucked each thorn from my neck and retreated to the bottom of the hill by foot.  By the time I reached my final destination, @CAPS couldn't breath. With her head buried in the snow, her abs were bouncing up and down with the rhythm of her laugh. She looked up at me, her bright green eyes and flushed pink cheeks told me how silly I had looked tumbling down the hill. She started to laugh one last time when a giant snot bubble burst out of her nostril. She started to crack up and I fell to the ground in a burst of laughter. I couldn't look at her anymore. Every time I glanced in her direction it became even more funny. I nudged my head into the snow just as she had done earlier. Finally when we had ourselves under control we looked up at each other. Our mascara was smeared around our eyes and down our cheeks. We resembled either clowns with a horrible makeup job or strange looking raccoons. Our laughs started to grow again, but quickly died down. Together we stood up. We spotted my bright red sled down by the frozen pond. ""@CAPS like a nice hike,"" I said. @CAPS we both started on our journey through the forest to retrieve it.  When I came shooting down the hill like a meteor, and she shot that snot bubble out of her nose like a rocket ship, I forgot everything. It was the first time in months that both of us felt at ease with our hardships. Laughter is the biggest connection we have with each other. When I laughed, my mind shut out the whole world. On snow days we now laugh to remember that cold @DATE day, but on that @DATE day we were laughing to forget.  ",23,23,0.0,46,0.0,0.0,0.0,46.0
12737,21321,8," My friends and I have a relationship that can not be matched. We do everything together and we always have each others back. A key element in our relationship is laughter. If we did not laugh with and at each other, we would most likely be at each others throats. We do many things that turn out in raging laughter, but there was one particular event that occurred that did not seem humorous at first, but as the event came to an end it quickly became humorous.  The story starts at @TIME as i arrived at the school to depart on a grueling five hour bus ride to @CAPS @CAPS for a wrestling tournament the following day. I slept for a solid @TIME hours before being awoken by my coach screaming at someone for spilling soda on the bus. We were almost in @CAPS @CAPS so i just turned on my @CAPS and listened to music the rest of the way. When we finally arrived at our @CAPS, we were instructed to go work off some extra weight before we could eat dinner.   After we had finished working out, we set off to get some dinner that way long overdue at this point. I was with my best friends, @CAPS and @CAPS, both with appetites as big as mine. We past many fast food restaurants, but we did not want any old burger, we wanted the masterpiece that is called a @ORGANIZATION. We had heard rumor that there was a @ORGANIZATION @CAPS establishment somewhere in @CAPS @CAPS, so we set out on our journey to @ORGANIZATION.We walked a good two miles along a highway, and took a few random alleys that we thought were shortcuts. I started to feel like we should go back and search more around the @CAPS, but against my better judgment we trudged forward towards where we thought the marvelous @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION was.   We soon found ourselves in an unknown part of town. We walked as quickly as possible to avoid the awkward stares from the people outside of their houses and the people roaming the streets. We tried to crack jokes to lighten the mood and to help ease the pain of realizing that we were tragically lost in @CAPS @CAPS. Stupidly, we all forgot our cell phones back at our @CAPS so we had no way to call for help. We started walking back the way we thought we had come, but all we saw were more old, weathered houses and buildings that were completely unfamiliar. We were all scared, but we masked our fears in hopes of not starting a state of panic.  We were all guessing that is was about nine-thirty, and we had to be back before ten to go to bed. This sent us into a panic more that anything. Our minds filled with images of our coach screaming at us with all his might, then making us run an agonizing five miles. We started frantically running down streets and alleys in hopes of seeing a familiar scene. After not seeing anything, and running for about ten minutes, we regrouped and continued walking. The fear that was once masked, was now clearly visible in all of our faces.   We came upon a digital billboard that displayed the time, and temperature. We only had ten minutes to make it back to our @CAPS or our fate was sealed. We began running again praying that we would arrive back on time. As we ran, we came upon the side of a big @CAPS. We did not know the name of the @CAPS we were staying at, so we decided to ask the person inside if they knew where it could be. The lady at the front counter informed us that were were now at the @CAPS @NUM, but she had just started her shift and did not know where we could be. As we thanked her and walked out the door, we were greeted with a strong slap to the head. we turned in shock to see our coach, red at a beat, pointing at his watch. We had almost made it, only @TIME minutes late.   after being screamed at for a solid twenty minutes, he sent us up to our room to sleep for the long day ahead of us. I was about to crawl in bed when i glanced out the bedroom window and saw what my heart so deeply longed for; the marvelous @ORGANIZATION. My friends and I immediately broke into hysterical laughter. We had gotten lost searching for the treasure that is @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION, and it turned out the treasure was in our own back yard. We hardly got any sleep that night due to all of the ironic laughter and the thoughts of what had just taken place. I never got to sink my teeth into one of those tasty, succulent @ORGANIZATION, but we did have a very funny and ironic experience that still makes me laugh to this very moment.",20,18,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12738,21322,8," Folded In @DATE it was right around @DATE, two of my friends and I were out riding quads laughing and having a great old time. They were teaching me how to do a wheelie on a quad. Soon after they started teaching me i figured out that what I had to do was hit all of my weight on the back end of the quad and f lore the gas so I could pop the front end up and I was just doing it fairly well from there on out. Well, when we were about ready to to go back up to the house one of my friends thought it would be super cool if we got a picture of one of us up on the front of the quad while the person driving pops a wheelie. To do this one of us sat on the front of the quad, one of us sat on the back of the quad and, one of us was driving. first thing we do when were all situated in the quad is that the driver pulls back a f lore's the quad (the driver doesn't need to slam down on the back of the quad because there is the extra weight from the person on the back)Which in turn pops the front end up. Then the person on the back jumps off and snaps a picture on their phone and then the person driving is supposed to brake and set the quad down. Lucky me I was the one that decided to sit on the front of the quad while my friend does a wheelie. While he was popping the wheelie either he pulled back to far and hard or he flored it for too long. So I was sitting on the front and it stayed up in the air for about five seconds and then the scary thing happened. The quad started leaning back so my friend jumped off and tried to hold it so I had some time to jump off but, I panicked and froze to the bar i was holding on to. Then the whole quad came down on me because my friend couldn't hold me up any longer. It slammed me into the ground, all @NUM lbs. of it, it caused my shins to hit me in the face( I have a hard time bending my head to my knees let alone my shins)and it super hyper-extended my back so much that I was lucky I didn't break it. When it hit me into the ground it felt like my legs sprung the quad off of myself but, it was really just my friend pushing it off. After the pushed the quad off of me I was laying there for like @NUM minutes laughing in pain for some reason that I can't remember.  After I was done screaming, yelling, and laughing in pain I got up and they drove me back up to the house. When we got back up there they handed me an ice pack and told me to go sit on the couch, I couldn't bend my back so I could sit down so I had to turn my back to the couch and basically fall onto the couch. While I was sitting there my back started to hurt excruciatingly bad so i thought if I lay flat on the floor it wouldn't hurt as bad and just like I thought it did. So I slept on the floor until morning because that was the only way I could get comfortable. The next day I woke up in really bad pain, it took me like two minutes to get off the floor it hurt so bad. shortly after I woke up I called my parents and had them come and pick me up from the house, I just barely got into the truck and my dad and I drove back to my house and i told my parents the whole story and my mom freaked out and thought I hurt myself extremely bad so she took me to the doctors office and he looked me over and told me I would just have to wait for my back to heal it's self and then i went home.

12739,21323,8," Most people believe that laughter is an essential need for your heath, not only physically, but socially as well. In a socially tense environment it is hard to achieve what is expected of you, but if someone will introduce laughter into the environment, it quickly changes into one that becomes more simplistic, and you are able to get done what is expected of you. With this mindset I proceeded into the conference room for the first time since @PERSON had left. @PERSON was the adviser for the @ORGANIZATION, or what we call @ORGANIZATION. @PERSON was the reason that a student from each school in @LOCATION had any say in what the @ORGANIZATION did or received school wise. She helped us voice our opinions and that made her a hero in the eyes of many high school students! Soon, @PERSON's time as adviser had expired and she announced her departure from her position. After a few weeks had gone by she had found a new adviser to take her place, @PERSON. I'm a person who is excepting of change, but the other members are not. This particular change was much to hefty for them; they just wanted things to go back to normal. When I sat down in my usual chair, the room seemed much less homely and I soon felt a sick feeling building up inside. I did not know who this woman was or what she was going to do; all I knew was that she was not @PERSON, and she did not make the @ORGANIZATION members very happy.  @PERSON glided into the room with a welcoming spirit about her. She stood at the head of the room and smiled. The rest of the members sunk a little further into their chairs, as if they were protesting her arrival. I thought to myself, she doesn't stand a chance, as I sat a little taller and began to listen to what she had to say. She spoke in a cheerful tone and seemed to giggle after every sentence. Although her posture provoked confidence, her giggle struck nervousness. There was only one way we, as a @ORGANIZATION, were going to get done what was needed. We had to see @PERSON as a friend not a foe. Immediately I decided to lighten the dank feeling in the room by starting a name game. This is a fun activity to learn a little more about people and to help @PERSON to remember our names. @PERSON seemed much more relaxed after the game so we continued with the meeting. With every second getting more serious I proposed that the meeting be done for the week and we spend the rest of the time talking and laughing about what had gone on that week. This made everyone smile. Time went on and with every passing moment the stress in the room became lighter and lighter, until the whole room was filled with laughter. It was as if @PERSON had never left! Soon the gathering came to a close and we all went home. On my way out @PERSON stopped me and told of her nervousness before the meeting because she wasn't sure how well everything was going to go. She was thankful that I jumped right in and helped brighten the spirits of the members. This eventually lead to the acceptance of the change and the effectiveness of @ORGANIZATION. By the next meeting the members were all anxious to go back and learn a little more about @PERSON, and were able to more fully concentrate on the matters at hand. Laughter helped the members of the @ORGANIZATION accept what they could not control and ultimately lead to our success today. Laughter is primarily the key to all success in the social society we live in today; with laughter anything is possible! Although the laughter was only for that one meeting, it allowed the members to be more welcoming to the idea of @PERSON, and made for a life long friendship between our adviser, and the members of our @ORGANIZATION. My relationship with @PERSON would not be as strong as it is today, if I did not share the opportunity to laugh at @PERSON's first @ORGANIZATION meeting.",23,20,0.0,43,0.0,0.0,0.0,43.0

This one laughing experience, it was the @DATE of my eighth grade year, so I was @NUM or @NUM. My family and family friends went on a camping trip. So the day before we were suppose to leave, my mother, brother and myself went up to set up camp. We when got to the campground, we immediately started putting everything together and organizing. It was a lot of fun but it was getting dark fast so we moved faster until it was completely finished. On our way out we noticed that we forgot something in the truck so my mom stopped the truck and looked at me and asked, @CAPS @CAPS want to drive right now?"". Of course I didn't think twice. I jumped out of the truck and ran to other side. All sorts of excitement was going through my body. When I got to the other side I hopped right onto the driver seat, with the biggest smile on my face. My mom was giving me all the steps on before starting the truck. Examples; seat belt, steering wheel, mirrors and adjusting the seat. The family vehicle was a stick shift so I was all sorts of nervous. I had no idea on how to shift and when to exactly. I used to watch my mom and step dad when they shifted and when, I would make humming noises but that obviously didn't help me any. The first thing I had to @CAPS was to start the truck because mom turned it off before she got out. I had to put the clutch in all the way and make sure it was in neutral. So I started that thing up, thinking to myself on how cool I probably look right now, the average @NUM year old ego. The going part was the worst! I probably killed the truck about @NUM times before the tires actually went at a constant speed that they should be going at. My mom said, ""The fifteenth time is a charm"". She probably thought she was being funny but trust me it was not a funny moment. I gave a nervous laugh right back at her, which probably didn't make me feel any better. So I started the truck once again and go to moving. I wasn't going very fast, more like the speed of a turtle but that was alright with me because I had no idea what was going on. The truck was going too slow to go anywhere, so I pushed in the gas a little bit harder. Coming around the bin, going about roughly @NUM miles per hour, still at a slow pace as before. The camp ground was only about @NUM to @NUM miles away. Which seemed like it was taking forever!  We were coming up to the campground. I could tell because we had a sign that said @PERSON with a arrow pointing left. So I took that left and saw all of our stuff. There was a river on the back side of where of our camp was and trees were circling all around us. So it was an enclosed area, except for one side. Where @CAPS could see to the other side of the river and there were other people camping on the other side. Which was kind of nice because they had kids my age. My mom pointed and told me to go over by the tent and park. For an inexperience driver I got anxious and put my foot onto the gas instead of the break so that @NUM m.p.h went up to about @NUM in the matter of seconds. We were going so fast that I couldn't really react to what was going on. All I could hear was my brother in the back seat yelling like when a little girl finds a spider. My mom grabbed onto the steering wheel as fast as she could because we were heading right towards the river and was about to make a quick visit to the people across the way. Instead of going that direction we went into a pick-nick table and pushed that right into another one and landed right onto a third table. We were at least @NUM feet off the ground onto the pile of broken tables. I had a adrenaline rush and I'm pretty sure the passengers did too.  We all got out of the truck and literally stopped and starred at the situation for a good @NUM minutes before we started busting up laughing. We all looked over across the river and saw their entire family just starring and laughing at us. My mom looked at them for a few seconds and then looked at us and said, ""@CAPS all can come over later for a fire!""""",18,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12741,21325,8," The night was a cool, @DATE night, not too cold but definetly not the muggy temperatures @DATE brought you. This was the type of @NUM degree weather that would allow you to wear jeans and a t-shirt and still be comfortable. The air hugged my skin as I walked up the path that led to my friends front door. Overhead I knew the stars hung in the sky but they were paid no attention by me. Inside the house I knew both of my bestfriends were awaiting my arrival. I also knew that there was a potential of them being angry with me. For what, I did not know. I did know that when I left school that day there was a feeling in my gut that told me something wasn't right. Walking home, as I increased the distance between them and me, there was a churning in my stomach that prodded me to look back. When I did, they were both staring at me with looks I couldn't (or didn't want to) place on their faces.  All of that made my heart give occasional, hard, thumps on my chest from the nervousness. Yet, I pretended that everything was okay. ""For all I know"", I told myself, ""it might as well be, and I'm overreacting."" I knocked on the white-painted wooden door and stared at the maroon side-paneling, waiting for an answer. My friend @LOCATION answered the door. From somewhere inside I could hear my other friend @PERSON laughing. I knew that I had missed out on something, the laughter explained that to me as I stepped inside. There was a hollow feeling in my chest. I wanted to know what I had missed out on. I hated not knowing. A mix of emotions jumped around inside my body, causing my head to be a jumbled mess that I couldn't make sense of.  I gently pushed open @LOCATION's bedroom door with my fingertips. Like always, the turquoise walls and the sound of radio station music jumped out to greet me. @PERSON was laughing and dancing to the music, but when she saw me, she stopped and stared. The moment seemed to stretch and expand in time. I felt my guard go up. If she was mad, fine. I didn't do anything wrong and I would maintain my innocence. The moment was stretching and stretching to the point I thought it might break, then @CAPS hugged me, completely catching me off gaurd, but filling me with a sense of right, because I'd known I hadn't done anything wrong. Everything seemed normal for what felt like a second and then @PERSON explained the gut feeling I had when I was walking home from school that day. I was being accused of not putting in any work into a reading project. The accusation appalled me and deflated my pride. Instead, a mild anger boiled up and I simply walked out the door and into the cool night. I heard my friends calling my name and following me down the street but I kept walking. I told myself this was out of anger, but @DATE I know it was for the sake of making a scene.  The footsteps I listened for behind me suddenly came at a faster pace. I glanced over my shoulder and saw @PERSON running at me. Against my will, I let out a high-pitched scream and started running, digging my feet into the concrete sidewalk. I felt determination flow through my veins. I would walk all the way home in the dark to make my point. @PERSON caught up to me and tried to pull me back to the house but I resisted with all my might. I knew I couldn't get out of her grip, out of sheer stubborness, I planted my butt on the curb and refused to budge. I realized I had only passed two houses. My friends exchanged glances and picked me up by my arms and legs and started carrying me towards the direction of the house. I grasped for the anger that was slipping from my hands. I wanted to stay mad but I couldn't. I started laughing and any tension I still felt swarming around me lifted up and flew away. A grin decorated my face from one ear to the other and my good sense came back to me gracefully. They set me down in the middle of the road. I looked up and admired the stars, that I had missed before, winking at me from above. The last ribbons of laughter still danced around in the air and whispered to me that everything was going to be okay.",25,20,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12742,21327,8,"  I was in @NUM grade; when it was almost the last day of school so since middle school years have been the lamest years of my life. I thought of my brothers pranks he had done while he was in middle school and one of them that was the funnest was the fire alarm prank. He told me the story to me all the time and that he did it a lot of times and also got away with it. I know I should at least try it since this was my last year in middle school and I should just go for it. well @NUM days before school was out I had a lighter with me and I had went into the girls bathroom, I noticed there was a alarm on the top of the roof so I stood on top sink and turned on the lighter, waved it around the white round fire alarm and then once I knew it, it went off. My friend was with me at the time I was thinking about it and told her before i did what i was going to do at the time and so she knew what i was about to do. But anyways back to what had happened... We all went outside, me and my friend were laughing so hard that everyone was looking at us with weird faces but then we told our closest friends what I had done and they all cracked up, even some lower grade kids herd about it but that's because they were by us and at the end it didn't get pretty. It was last period and I was in computer class when my vice principal came and got me from class then took me into her room and she asked me if I was the person who turned off the fire alarm and I was like no then asked me again and I still said no. Finally she told me that when I was doing whatever I was doing to make it go off; did I notice if there were people in the stalls at that time? I said no and she told me that there were two people in there and one of them had told on me. So it ended up with me getting in big trouble with being on probation, going to the fire department to apologize for what I had did and how much time it takes for them to do there job on fires at school, then had community service the whole @DATE, and almost didn't get to walk in my promotion with the @DATE class which got me down. I do regret doing what I had done since I think of it all now, it was something childish and stupid. For some reason it was my funniest moment of my life and I'll always have that as one of my @NUM top favorite memories and moments of any school year. True Story.",16,17,0.0,33,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.0
12743,21329,8,"My story about laughter is going to be a true story about me. This story is about my trip to the doctors. I love to play sports always have, always will. Iv been playing football for about @NUM years now and iv never been hurt, except one pracitce. It was in @NUM grade. My football team always does one hitting drill once a week. The drill is called truck and trailer. Its where you have @NUM people. Two people on offence and two peole on defense. The two people on offence are trying to score and the two people on defence are trying to stop them. Of course I get stuck with running the ball and not to mention the worst person on the whole team blocking for me. This kid couldn't do anything on the football field other then keep the bench warm. The two biggest and best hitters were on defence trying to kill me. I knew that this was going to be bad. All I could do was run fast, so i do. My coach (my dad) hikes the ball and I take off. Soon enough they catch up with me and take me off my feet. One went high and the other went low. I hit the ground and stayed down. I hear my teammates start screaming. I thought it was because i got ''cracked"". I thought wrong. I sit up and my knee kinda hurts. I look at it and it looks like rubber. My leg was pointing the opposite way that it's supposed to go. Iv only seen a brake like that on tv and youtube. My dad doesnt hesitate too call @NUM. The ambulance came to the field @NUM minutes later. They came down to the field and put my on a strecher. My team wasnt the only team that used that field. About @NUM other teams practiced at the same time. All eyes were on me. And on my leg. The other teams didnt know what happened except that they had a big ice back on my private area. All my friends thought I hurt my man parts. It was embarrasing and funny at the same time. When they all found out it was my leg they still woud make fun of me. I had horrible nicknames for a long time. It wasnt fun for me and especially not funny. But all my friends thought it was hilasious.",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12744,21330,8," Being on a team doesn't always mean that everyone is the best of friends; most of the time the case is that you really don't get along with the people on your team. That was the case for the @ORGANIZATION (@CAPS @CAPS of @LOCATION) @CAPS that I'm a member of. Everything changed after our trip to @LOCATION, @LOCATION for @ORGANIZATION. It was late, twelve members of the @ORGANIZATION @CAPS were shuffling into the @LOCATION to check-in. Everyone was in their group of friends talking and anxiously waiting to leave @ORGANIZATION for our eight day trip. Each group of people didn't always get along with the people in the other groups (even though we were a team) other people got along with everyone they just had their own close friends that they stuck with. Emotions were at a wide variety that night between the tension of conflict between people, nervousness, and excitement. When our plane had finally landed in @LOCATION everyone was completely drained of energy, but once again everyone split up into their own groups and we moved through the @LOCATION. @CAPS we walked through the @LOCATION to the luggage claim I began to wonder, "" @CAPS is it that we are all together and a team, but we separate ourselves to different groups amongst our team and everyone notices, but it doesn't change?"" @CAPS I pondered the thought we headed out to the rental vehicles and loaded everything up and started the day. After the long day of flying and touring places around downtown @LOCATION we finally were at the hotel checking in. @CAPS we checked in everyone separated vastly with their groups of friends who they rooming with to check-in to their rooms. Later that evening a few us that were really close friends went outside to hang out by the campfires they had at the hotel we were staying at. @CAPS we sat there talking and laughing, having a great time there was a moment when we just sitting there quietly, and I proceeded to ask them about what I been thinking about back at the @LOCATION. The response I got back from everyone was blank stares and a change of subject. The next morning came early, we went off to breakfast then left for the day to go do some touring. The first place we went to out of three place we were to be touring that day was the @ORGANIZATION. At the @ORGANIZATION our @CAPS faced our first team building/bonding activity. The task we were to accomplish with one another was difficult at first for everyone, but we all slowly began having a fun time laughing and working to accomplish what we needed. After we had finished the activity everyone began to slowly mingle with people outside their normal group. Later that same day we had a second team building/bonding activity. After we finished that activity there was a sense of less tension between everyone, even less than from after the morning activity. The following day we had two more team building/bonding activities. Each time we had an activity everyone began to connect more and more and each time came more laughter. We also began to spend more @CAPS a whole @CAPS and got have an even better time of fun and laughter filled adventures. By the time we were all heading to the @LOCATION to fly back to @LOCATION everyone was hanging out and there was no conflict. @CAPS the plane took off the realization of everything had came to me of @CAPS before there was so much conflict and everyone being split up into separate groups. I realized that we had always been on a ""business like"" relationship with one another we never gave the chance to laugh, have a good time, and connect and allow us to get to know each other. Once we took the time to allow all of those things we learned who everyone was and made friendships.",17,20,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12745,21331,8," They say that ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" and I agree completely. You can't be in an relationship or have a friendship with someone and not share laughter with them. It makes things last between one another and makes both partners happy. If there's no laughter between the two, that connection will be more difficult to have.  I have a bestfriend and her names @CAPS.

12746,21332,8,"Laughing @CAPS you remember when you would laugh so hard you couldn't breathe? Or when you started crying because you were laughing? When ever I start laughing I am always with my best friend, @PERSON. We sometimes even when things aren't funny. We giggle at everything. Memories, the future, or even just looking at each other we laugh. You name it, we've laughed at it.  @PERSON and I have almost always laughed together. From when we first met in seventh grade, and now when I am a freshman, we still don't ever stop. She was in my sixth period class and we sat by each other. After the first couple of minutes we talked we both knew something good was going to come from this. So of course, from that moment on we had to be best friends. I couldn't ask for a friend better then her. She is the best.  All of our free time was spent with one another. Even some time when we were busy we were still together. @PERSON and I were together basically every day and every night. We would camp out in my backyard, or ride bikes around the town. I would go swimming with her family. She would go to @LOCATION with ours. Both of both of our families would go and @CAPS things together. We did all sorts of things together. No matter what we always laughed.  Growing up can be pretty tough sometimes for anybody. @PERSON and I were no exception to this. After a bad day, you would know you could find us on the phone talking to each other. We could talk for hours and hours about the littlest things. I think we have talked for three hours before just about what we were going to wear the next day. Never hanging up until one of us getting told to get off the phone. I think I can speak for the both of us when I say, we hung up with a completely different outlook on life. Even on the worst of our days, we were still laughing. I don't think I would ever be able to grow up with out her. @PERSON is such a big part of my life. I would be nothing without her.  @PERSON and I @CAPS not go to the same school anymore, but that still doesn't prevent us from laughing. If you have ever had a friend as close to you as @PERSON is to me, you know how great it feels to be close to somebody. Just think about the feeling of never ending laughter. I strongly believe with all of my being, it is one of the best feelings in the world. @PERSON and I never stop, why should I let anybody else. With out laughter, we wouldn't be as close as we are today. With out laughter the world wouldn't be how it is today. So find a friend and start laughing.

12747,21333,8," Isnt it funny how just a laugh can change a senery, a mood like someones face expression, and make a person laugh out of nowhere just because it is outrageous, or the laugh they hear sounded funny. I personaly have been through all of these stages of what I like to call, the contagious circle of laughs. In the past I have been cheered up by laughing, and hearing others laugh. At times even I have cheered others by makeing them laugh, or laughing at @CAPS own humourless jokes. It feel good to laugh, and at the end of @CAPS long lasting giggles I feel refreshed from useing all that energy just to make a noise. @CAPS friends pick me out to be the clown in our group. They all think im this hilarious joke popper ( I pop out all these funny jokes ) I personaly dont think im that funny, but for some reason just by makeing them laugh I laugh too. There is this one joke I made up all by myself to cheer up @CAPS friend @LOCATION. It made everyone fall on the floor laughing. It is about walking through the store, and seeing the different nationalitys of mothers with there baby's. How each mother treats there baby's differently. At the end I tell how the african american mother yells at her baby to shut up. I use a cuss word but thats inappropriate for this writeing piece. You get the idea. Anyway @CAPS friends still to this day ask me to tell them that joke, and they always laugh just as loud as the first time I told them. There is always one person in your life that your totaly obbsesed about there laugh, only because you love the way it sounds. I personaly fell in love with @CAPS boyfreinds laugh, and that was why he looked so darn cute to me. The very first time we met he was picking on his cousin @CAPS in a park up in @LOCATION. I was with @CAPS friend @PERSON in the trailer park where her dad lived at the time. Malikye ( @CAPS boyfriend ) had this laugh that made me want to scream ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS!"", it was so funny. I wanted to run over to him and tickle him to death so he couldnt ever stop laughing. Most of the people that know him hate his laugh, and think it is obnoxious. He even hates his own laugh. I dont know why but I was addicted to it. It is funny how even hearing someones laugh can give you feelings for them. A laugh not only shows you sound, but shows you personality, and charecter. Laughing is a big importance in life. It shows so much about a person, and helps so many people. I love laughing. People should be full of laughter, because without it the world would be a dull and unhappy place. I dont know anyone who would want that.

The first time I went to take the test I went with my best friend @PERSON. @PERSON had already taken the test once and failed so she was trying again. We got to the @ORGANIZATION at @NUM a.m sharp. I was anxiously sitting there waiting to take my test and that's when they called my number. The women at the @ORGANIZATION was very nice to me she said ""all I need is your birth certificate, your social security, and proof of enrollment"" I handed the envelope to her that I had containing all of these. She okay'd me to go and take my test I sat at computer number six. I was not nervous at all I thought how could I not pass this.When the test began there was so many questions of things I didn't know like motorcycles,left turns, and things about animals that were on the road. I finished the test with @PERCENT I only needed to get @PERCENT to pass, I was bummed out that I had failed. @PERSON however had passed her test I was happy for her and I congratulated her but I was still in a way jealous of her. My @CAPS and @PERSON told me ""it's okay you will get it for sure next time!"" @CAPS they were wrong. I was supposed to be one of the first people out of my group of friends who was going to get there permit. I had no idea that all of my other friends would get it before I did. It seemed like every week one of my friends would get their permit and just pass me up. I was extremely discouraged and sad about this because in a way I felt like a failure but I was determined to get my permit no matter how many times it took me.  I went back @DATE after taking my permit test for the first time to take my test again I failed, I had failed for the second time. I went back again five more times I failed my permit test five times. My @CAPS and I were driving back one morning after I had failed I was very sad because I was going to have to wait a whole month again before I could take it. That is when my @CAPS just started cracking up laughing hysterically at me. I was very confused at why she would act this way. She told me ""sometimes you just have to relax in situations and learn it is okay to not always get things right the first time life is about sticking to things and having fun if you can't laugh at mistakes that are made then what is the fun in that?"" I realized she was completely right and that's when I stopped beating myself up over not getting my permit. I laughed hysterically the rest of the car ride home. I didn't mind that I didn't pass because I knew I was going to get it if I just relaxed and studied.  The next month I went back to take the test again. I went through all the steps in the @ORGANIZATION again I waited for them to call my number, I gave the women my information, and I sat down at the computer. I got @PERCENT this time! I was so stoked and so happy that I had passed I was mostly just surprised my @CAPS's advice had worked.  @DATE that day I was driving home from the store with my @CAPS. I was not the best driver I think because it was only my first day, and she was yelling at me to slow down and hit the brakes as I pulled into the driveway. I had mistaken the gas for the break and I ran into the garage door. Surprisingly she had started laughing and this made me laugh. Instead of yelling at me and reaming me for this mistake we were able to laugh about it and I think that is what made a world of difference, because if she would have yelled at me I would have been discouraged to try driving again. Now I have had my permit for four months not only am I a better driver but I have learned to relax a little bit more I have learned to laugh a lot more and not take so many great simple things in the world for granite. I also think that it made me closer to my @CAPS in a way so I guess it is true what they say ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""",18,20,36.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0

We tried to get out, but right when we did, @PERSON picked us up @CAPS threw us in! She was laughing the whole time! While we were screaming yelling for each other. @CAPS for help!   When we got out of the bathtub she threw us back up on the bed @CAPS finally untied our bandannas @CAPS ropes! After she turned the light back on we looked at our wrists @CAPS ankles @CAPS there was red marks all over them. @LOCATION said ""@CAPS!

Our boat is big so we just put all our stuff in it, like sleeping bags, coolers of food, and all the @CAPS gear we would need for salmon. we also brought a camp stove for our food we make on the boat. There was also another guy named @PERSON but we call him big @PERSON hes very funny guy that provided a lot of laughter on the boat.When we get there we had to stop at a bait shop to get some prawns and spinner blades, that's what we use to catch the salmon.

There would be some days usually @DATE like @NUM boats on each side of us and it got hectic and some times funny because some of the guys out there don't even know how to operate a boat.  When we got there after we geared our poles up we put them out in the water, my pole went down and hooked a nice bright @CAPS and fought him for about fifth teen minutes and my @CAPS netted it and it was a keeper fish. After all that my @CAPS said that was a small fish. Right around dark we reeled are poles in and put them away neatly in the boat. Right when it got dark it was time for bed and it was quite on the river there was no one on the river besides so we didn't have to worry about other people rocking our boat while we were sleeping. The next morning was cold and windy but luckily we brought our top to cover us from getting wind burn, because last time we went we got wind burnt so bad it hurt for about a week. finally my buddies pole goes down and hes all excited about hooking a fish, about ten minutes go by and he realizes he hooked on a log that floated by, me and my @CAPS knew he hooked on it but we didn't want to say any thing because it would be funny him getting all excited. My @CAPS's pole goes down and it was fish on, so i throw the anchor out we float down get it in the net another fish too take home and we had two in the boat but my buddy is the only one that needs to get a fish so we all have one to take home.  After all day of being on the boat it was about time to head off home and get ready for the begging of the week. Right about two o clock, I look over my pole tip slams to the water another fish on hand it to my buddy he's fighting it, he was having trouble reeling though because the drag was tight but then i fix it he gets in the boat, his first salmon ever he was happy. perfect timing, because about fifteenth minutes later we leave to go home. the @CAPS was fun we got some fish, we had some funny moments, and most of all I got my buddy his first salmon.

12752,21340,8," There have been many times in my life in which laughter was the key ingredient. My family is always laughing. We could be laughing at a movie, or a joke someone just made. We even laugh when the jokes are aimed at us. The same thing can be said about me and my friends. My friends and I laugh at almost anything. I believe that laughter has been one of the most important pieces of my life, without it life would be almost meaningless. I can remember one @DATE when my friends and I decided to go camping at a lake for a week. We all packed up our tents, sleeping bags and other camping necessities. When we got to the lake it wasn't very crowded so we had no difficulty picking a camping spot. Once we finished unpacking our gear and setting up our tents we decided to go swimming. One of my friends shouted, ""I'll race you down to the lake!"" @CAPS took about five steps before @CAPS stepped in a small hole the perfect size for his foot to fit in and @CAPS fell flat on his face. Everyone started busting up laughing, it was like we couldn't stop. When my friend who had fallen finally got up @CAPS was laughing too. We spent the rest of the @DATE swimming and making fun of his fall, the best part about it was @CAPS joked around too.  That night we stayed up eating junk food hot dogs and smores till we almost burst then one by one we all passed out. over the next couple days we did pretty much the same things. We swam in the lake, took hikes in the woods, fished for a little while, and made fun of each other laughing almost the entire time. On the @DATE that we were there we all decided to wake up early and take one @DATE hike to the top of the nearest mountain. The trip to the top went smoothly and no one fell or got hurt. The only eventful thing that happened on the way up was that one of my friends dropped his water bottle and had to chase it halfway down the mountain. To us this was funny but not nearly as funny as what happened next. Before going down we all took a ""potty break"" as one of my friends called it, the only problem with this was that one of my friends decided to pee in what @CAPS thought was an empty hole. As it turned out the whole was not empty but home to hundreds of underground wasps. Unfortunately for us @CAPS didn't realize this until it was too late. Wasps began pouring out of there home searching for whoever was disturbing them, which happened to be us. My screamed in horror, ""@CAPS crap its a bees nest!"" The next thing I knew we were running as fast as we could down the mountain with seemingly thousands of wasps following us. The lucky ones had finished relieving themselves and ran away with ease, the unlucky ones were not quite finished and had yet to pull up their pants. Running with your pants around your ankles is not an easy thing to do just in case your wondering and two of my friends found this out the hard way. As they tried to run away they tripped over themselves and started to roll all @CAPS while they were being stung by the wasps.  We all made it down the mountain with very few injuries and not too many bee stings. I remember the first thing we did when we got back was laugh till we cried. Once we were out of danger this instance seemed like the funniest thing that had ever happened. My friends and I still bring up stories about our crazy camping trip and the run in with the cranky underground wasps to this @DATE. I still think its one of the funniest things that will ever happen in my life and I am looking forward to the next crazy event. I believe that laughter has been one of the most important pieces of my life, without it life would be almost meaningless.",20,17,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12753,21342,8," My alarm went on at @TIME. It was another normal @DATE for all of my friends, but a big day for me. It was time to get up, eat breakfast, brush my teeth, put the last couple things in my suitcase, and head to the airport. For the @CAPS time I was going to fly on a plane across the ocean, and it was the last day with my family in @LOCATION for a whole year. The next time I'll wake up will be in a totally different place, country, and family, where I have never been before. It will be a new start for me and my life won't be the same anymore. I will be an exchange student on a high school in the @LOCATION. After changing planes @NUM times and @NUM hours of traveling, I was finally at the airport in @LOCATION, where my host parents were waiting for me with a big sign which said my name on it. I was very happy and excited that I finally arrived, but primarily I was really tired. We took off and headed ""home"". My new home was a little green house on a small ranch in the high desert of @LOCATION, @NUM minutes out of town, and without public transportations. Due to the hot temperatures and the dry air I was very tired the @CAPS weeks. Adjusting myself took me about a month. Before school started, I visited my new high school and met the school principle. I also got my schedule and signed up for the soccer team, which had their @CAPS meeting the following @DATE. It was good to see kids that will be on my school and in my classes.  Finally my @CAPS day of high school was coming up. It was exciting for me, but I couldn't hide that I was very nervous. After a one hour drive to the school I got off the school bus and walked into the building. It felt like thousands of people were in the hallway looking at me. I walked faster. I was hoping my @CAPS day would start out good. Finally, I reached my locker, and pulled out the little peace of paper with my locker combination on it out and tried to open it. Even though, I did it @NUM times my locker won't open.  ""@CAPS spin it @NUM times right, go to the @CAPS number, go left, pass the second number once..."", I was whispering to myself. The bell already rang, and thankfully a friend that I knew from soccer stopped by and asked me if I needed help. We both started laughing and I was so glad she helped me out or I would have been late to class on my @CAPS day. For the next couple times I needed her help again, until I figured out how to open my locker three days later.  Being open-minded, being friendly and smile are three things that are very important in life. Besides that another very important one for me is also to laugh about mistakes I make. More than anything else, coming to a new culture, land and meeting new people gave me a lot of experience for my life. Especially learning how to laugh about mistakes or situations to not get frustrated. Getting frustrated would have made my time harder and not as enjoyable. Laughing makes it easier for me to learn from mistakes I made and to move on. My mom once told me to be courageous to make mistakes, and I don't regret any mistake I made.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12754,21343,8," He laughed, I hadn't heard his laugh all day. It was just after @DATE and @PERSON and I had just fixed our off and on relationship. He had picked @CAPS up from my house so we could hangout at his. He had seemed upset since he had picked @CAPS up which was completely out of the norm for him. He was always smiling or laughing and had some funny story to tell @CAPS, but not today. Today he was quite, we had been together for about two hours already and he'd said all of about a sentence to @CAPS and I had only gotten one of those lame half smiles that really meant ""I'm not in the mood so just stop"".  We were watchingDespicable @CAPS for about the third time when the yelling started, he was standing against the wall next to his bed when his dad just started shouting, his voice was followed by a higher softer voice yelling back, it was @PERSON's step mom. The were arguing about cheating or drinking or staying out to late, I really don't remember, I couldn't hear to well and I was paying attention to @PERSON to watch for his reaction. He stood where he was for a couple minutes just staring straight in front of him, he looked like he was going to cry. Then he slumped to the ground, pulled his knees up, crossed his arms over them and put his head on his arms, for a second I thought he was crying. My big tough guy who didn't ever deal with anyone's crap looked as hurt and helpless as he could get, he looked more helpless then I felt. I mean what could I do, I had no idea whether he would want to be left alone or if he'd want someone to hug him and make him feel better so I sat where I was, on his bed, leaning against the wall just looking at him hoping he do something to help @CAPS decide what would help him feel better. In the living room his parents were still screaming and yelling at one another when another voice joined in, it was his step mom's friend, @PERSON. She was trying to stop them from fighting, trying to help but @PERSON's dad, @PERSON, wasn't one to interrupt, when he was mad you simply stayed out of his way. @PERSON had made a mistake. Suddenly there was a crash, @PERSON jumped, and the sound of cupboards being slammed and glass being broken, the only statement I could make out was ""that was your grandma's, your mom is gonna be pissed!"" from @PERSON's step mom. @PERSON got up, walked over to his door, and locked it. He stood there for a second with his forehead against the door then he turned and walked over to @CAPS, he laid @CAPS down and cuddled with @CAPS.   There was more shouting now, something about food, cars, and getting all of someones crap out of the house. There was the sound of food being thrown, then a door slamming and tires screeching. Finally they were done. @PERSON was leaving too, you could tell by the sound of a big diesel truck driving off. Now we were alone, @PERSON finally looked at @CAPS, I could tell he was sad, he still looked like he wanted to cry. I could tell he hated the fighting and that's when I realized that's what had been wrong with him all day, they had been fighting like this all week, they were getting divorced. It wasn't the first divorce he had been through either, that was his dads third wife that had just walked out the door.   ""@CAPS, that's hell and really scary. Promise @CAPS WE will @CAPS fight like that?"" I said. I had @CAPS heard anyone fight like that and frankly it scared @CAPS, I would @CAPS want that kind of thing going on in my house.  ""I promise.""he smiled.  I kissed him on the nose and went to get up but he pulled @CAPS back down and kissed my nosed, I looked at him and smiled "" @CAPS, I really really gotta pee."" That was all it took, he laughed, I hadn't heard his laugh all day.",25,22,0.0,47,0.0,0.0,0.0,47.0
12755,21344,8,"  Dog @CAPS Of @DATE  @CAPS made me laugh every time I saw her droopy ears and pointy little nose. @CAPS was my best friend, my dog. @CAPS brought me happiness every moment I was with her. Barking at the squirrels in the backyard to keeping me warm at night. All the crazy stuff that amazing dog did, brought a smile to my face. The laughter and joy to my heart.  Every @DATE when we went camping with the @PERSON family, we had to bring her with us. We had to bring her her own sleeping bag and camping chair to sit in. After a long day of swimming and walking around the lake,@CAPS would hop up in her chair and go to sleep by the warm fire. When we walked with the other families dog @PERSON, @CAPS would carry her own leash like in her mouth like I would've been holding it. Every little thing @CAPS did differently than the average dog made us laugh. @CAPS was ""@CAPS,"" as we called her. @CAPS also loved to ""log."" @CAPS pulled around giant logs or sticks in the water and chewed on them until there was nothing left but back. All of the grandparents loved her too. Grandpa had special cookies just for her because @CAPS didn't like just any cookie. The time @CAPS went over to his house on his birthday wearing her own party hat, jumping on his lap to give him a birthday kiss. He laughed so hard his eyes started to water. Every time we went somewhere the other grandma would beg to ""@CAPS-sit,"" @CAPS. Che loved her so much. When @CAPS was there @CAPS didn't get a kennel or a dog bed, @CAPS got the couch. @CAPS would take @CAPS into town to buy her a cheeseburger and go to the park.  I taught her to do tricks like the @LOCATION where @CAPS bounced on her hind legs in circles, and I also taught her @CAPS to speak. I would say ""@CAPS's on top a house?"" ""@CAPS. (@CAPS),"" ""who was the greatest @CAPS player ever?"" ""@CAPS (@CAPS @CAPS),"" and ""@CAPS does sandpaper feel?"" ""@CAPS."" That made everyone laugh. We would spend hours doing nothing but tricks and playing in the back yard.  Our family took her on @CAPS we called ""@CAPS @CAPS,"" to the river to go swim and fish with us. @CAPS had fun running and splashing with us in the water. We also took her to the coast to play on the beach.We took her everywhere with us, and @CAPS loved it. @CAPS was also the only dog at the park that knew @CAPS to slide. Everyone was so amazed at @CAPS @CAPS could do. They had never seen anything like her before.  @CAPS made many people laugh and smile when they saw her. @CAPS was my best friend and the smartest dog I knew. From going to the park to slide, camping and swimming to just being a lazy dog, @CAPS made me laugh. @CAPS's gone now, but her memory still remains. @CAPS will never be forgotten.

12756,21345,8,"Laughters importance in human life   In life there are many things that make a person happy but none come close to the joy of laughter. @CAPS and friends always come together and share a good laugh, it's why we get together, to have a great time with the ones we love and enjoy being around. My @CAPS every year gets together on thanksgiving and it is always one of my favorite times becuase when my @CAPS shows up he really knows how to make you laugh until you drop to the floor crying becuase you are laughing so hard. He has that sense of knowing how people work and he knows that a smile and a laugh could turn someones bad day into a fantastic day. @CAPS is the greatest thing someone could ask for and when every one is together it only makes the time sweeter, now add a laugh, a few smiles and you have yourself a great time! My @CAPS has so many jokes and corny lines that he can use to to try and make somebody laugh but its not just what he says that makes it so funny, it is the timeing in which he does it. I wish to learn from him and use his people skills to return the favor and help people have a better day just by sharing a good laugh and put a bit smile on there face becuase not only does it make them feel good but it also can make yourself feel better knowing that you just helped somebody else have a better day just by telling a small joke or saying something funny that got there attention enough, and you never know taht person could one day turn back and remember what you did for them and tell somebody else and then it's a domino affect. He/she will tell somebody about what happened it and they will make somebody else's day better just by a small and simple laugh.  Most friendships and relationships start with laughter because one of you had the confidence to break the ice with one another, sometimes thats all it takes to start a friendship that will last a lifetime. So every one can share a good laugh, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from everybody is subject to a ""hoot and a holler"" every now and then. When I met now my best friend who is like a brother to me, it all started with a joke that brought a smile to both of our faces and an unforgetable laugh. From that day to now we are the best of friends that life could have handed us, so all it takes is for you to want to really go out and just be yourself and make somebody laugh.  Laughter is the greatest thing in life that people need to do every day to keep their spirits high and lively no matter the circumstances that your in. The military has to go to war and live in an hostile inviroment but they still find time to sit down as a unit and share a drink and luagh about something. It is in our blood to enjoy life so don't try to avoid people or the luaghter that wants to come out. When your having a terrible day the best thing to do is go to a buddies house and just hang out becuase the people that truely care about you will find a way to enliven your spirit and make you laugh which will bring a smile to your face and whole new start to the day, it's like a refreshment for your body. When i am having a bad day all i have to do is think about something that me and a friend did that was funny and it will bring either a smile across my face or laugh coming out and sometimes both. Laughter is the key to life becuase it can turn anything negative into a positive. When you go to a party with @CAPS or friends do you sit in the back and think about nothing, no you get up and have a great time with your friends and always end sharing a good laugh with somebody.  I believe with all my heart that laughter is not just the key to life but the key to the inside a person, it shows who they are becuase nobody can hide or shake the want to laugh at something funny, it's just not possible for somebody to do. Laughter comes from the heart and the soul inside a person and those two things alone are very powerful and when they want to sing and rejoice which comes out as laughter you can't deny the need. When two or more people are gathered the ability to create an enviroment where anyone can be themselves and enjoy the laugh not just fake it it what every person looks for so when someone said this, it is so true ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"".",15,17,0.0,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.0

I had moved to @LOCATION, after @NUM weeks went by @CAPS parents started going to church, while we was at church I meet some other kid who was about @CAPS age. I didn't know but I saw in his hand. @CAPS hasa deck of card. I noticed it right away that @CAPS liked to play yu-gi-oh which is a card game, which is very fun to play when I was @NUM..., I wanted to ask him if @CAPS wanted to play the card game yu-gi-oh but I was too nervous to ask him, after church ended and @CAPS parents and I went home the day passed by. The next morning I had to get ready for @CAPS first day in school in @LOCATION, it was kinda hard since I am going to be in that new school with no friends but once I got their I notice something right away i saw that same kid from yesterday I was kinda surprise since @CAPS'd go to the same church as me. After @CAPS teacher told me to sit down I took a seat, @CAPS teacher begin roll call saying each students in are class name, each students replied and said ""here!"" when it came to that other kids turn his name was @PERSON,once class started it went by kinda fast when you are busy doing class work so once lunch started I went to have lunch and surprisingly a lot of students in @CAPS class are nice to me they asked if I wanted to be their friends. I was happy since they asked but that one kid @PERSON didn't ask. So I thought @CAPS was mad at me later on after school before I gotten on the bus to go home I saw that @PERSON kid again so I ran to him and asked if @CAPS liked playing yu-gi-oh? @CAPS ""replied yea what bout you?"" I ""told em yea we should play yu-gi-oh sometimes"" @CAPS said we could play this @DATE at church. I told em @CAPS. later on that day I told @CAPS older brother @CAPS, I made some friends at are school, and this @DATE I'm going to play yu-gi-oh card with one of them named @PERSON who goes to are church, @CAPS brother @CAPS told me oh... @PERSON goes to are school? I said yea and @CAPS said I played yu-gi-oh card game with him last time at church. I was shock since @CAPS older brother knew @CAPS was and i didn't that time. I asked him why @CAPS didn't tell me @CAPS knew someone that play yu-gi-oh card, @CAPS said "" cause you didn't ask"" I was like... Oh.....

12758,21347,8," It was @DATE. The day was beautiful and full of happy faces. A perfect day to be at the fair. I was sitting on a bench next to @PERSON this guy I really liked, but I doubted @CAPS liked me of course. I had caught him staring at me a couple of times and I just thought I had something on my face that really cached his attention, like a piece of food since we had just at a couple minutes before or something. I looked at him and asked ""@CAPS?""""@CAPS"" @CAPS said with a huge smile on his face.""@CAPS tell me @CAPS @CAPS funny"" I demanded throwing a smile back at him.""@CAPS is funny, but.."" @CAPS paused for a moment.""@CAPS can i ask @CAPS out?"" @PERSON asked. I felt my face turn red, my body temperature raised and my leg began to move without control. ""@CAPS cant know I have strong feelings for him"" I thought to my self. ""@CAPS just play it off like @CAPS hes joking..because @CAPS is joking right?""""@CAPS @PERSON? are @CAPS okay?"" @CAPS asked as @CAPS put his hand on my lap.""@CAPS I'm fine, its just.."" I paused for a long time.""@CAPS @CAPS say @CAPS I @CAPS understand"" @CAPS said as his head slowly faced the ground. I didn't know @CAPS to say, I felt stuck. I wanted to say @CAPS much but the words wouldn't come out.""@CAPS don't mess with me like that, I know your joking @PERSON"" I laughed nervously. @PERSON looked at me with a confused face like @CAPS @CAPS was saying ""Was I not clear enough"" or ""@CAPS I just walk away?"".  His smile turned into a serious expression and the glow of his eyes had disappeared. I felt something on my throat, words were stuck and they needed to come out!.""@CAPS can ask me out any time and my answer @CAPS always be @CAPS"" I said feeling relived.""@CAPS does that make @CAPS my girlfriend @PERSON?""""I don't know @PERSON..@CAPS have not asked me out yet"" I said with a grin on my face. We looked at each other for a second and busted out laughing, like @CAPS it was the funniest thing in the world. I didn't fully understand why we were laughing and @CAPS probably didn't either, but that didn't stop us. I started feeling a cramp in my stomach from all the force I was putting on my it which maid me to stop laughing. @PERSON took my hand and we walked towards the roller coaster ride. In my head I imagined him kneeling down on one knee and asking me to be his girlfriend, and at that moment the noises in the background would disappear, and the camera would only be focused on us. Although that probably only happens in the end of a romantic movie were everyone lives ""happily ever after"". I looked over at @PERSON realizing I wasn't in a movie, I was in this place called reality. @CAPS was looking at me like @CAPS I had something on my face again, but it didn't really bother me any more. We got on the roller coaster and a few other rides, which totally made me feel like I needed to throw up. I was standing in the ticket line wen for some reason I felt this joy inside of me, like @CAPS I was the happiest person on this world. @CAPS bothered me that day not even wen something was supposed to bother me, I just ignored it because I felt like @CAPS it really didn't matter. I had the biggest smile on my face like @CAPS I had just got bot-ox and couldn't make any other expression except for that one. The sun hid behind the clouds, and the day darkened right before my eyes. I had felt like the day hadn't been long enough because of all the fun I had been having. I was starting to believe that time really does fly, even though i knew better than that. The time to go home had come and the people heading out of the fair had exhausted looks that didn't even let them smile because they were @CAPS worn out. @PERSON and I walked towards the car. As we walked @CAPS seemed kind of worried. ""@CAPS wrong @PERSON"" I asked noticing his not @CAPS happy expression. ""I haven't officially asked @CAPS out"" @PERSON said. ""@CAPS ask me I'm ready"" I repliedJorge hurried in front of me and stopped me from walking. ""@CAPS @CAPS be my girlfriend @PERSON..Again?"" @CAPS grindButterflies ran down and up my stomach, and my feet weakened. ""uhhhh..I mean @CAPS of course @CAPS be your girlfriend"" I stuttered. I guess the expression on my face was hilarious or something because @CAPS began to giggle. @CAPS i decided to laugh too even though I didn't know @CAPS was funny but oh well.

12759,21348,8,"  In all of our lives there is that one person that is so special you would never do anything to hurt them. Whether that person be a close friend, a significant other, or a family member. The people that are involved in our lives significantly are there to help us through the rough patches, bring us up when we are down, and be there for us. Friends are one of the most important people we have in life. Friends are someone we can talk to and they understand, someone we share everything with including clothes, food, etc. They are the ones that get us through each day with a smile. High school is filled with drama, it's the same old story just, a different day. I have the best group of friends, we are very close and spend a lot of time with each other at school and outside of school. They are there for me when I need them the most. Recently this guy, @PERSON and I have been trying to work on our relationship but he had been lying to me and cheating on me but everyone of my friends that I talk to abut the situation say the same thing, ""he is going to hurt you"" and ""he's not worth your tears."" I have class with him every other day. It's not like I get to choose when I want and don't want to see him, some days are just better than others. The bell rang, right after lunch, and I wasn't in any hurry to get to the band room. The band room is very big, smells like old cheese and is like a trampoline for sound to bounce off of and explode in your face. I don't enjoy that class at all. I walked in the room nonchalantly and set all my books on my chair and began walking to my cubby. I grabbed my instrument walked back to set it on my chair and went to talk with some of my friends. It hadn't been a bad day so far, it was just a regular day at school. Entering the band room I had a feeling that @DATE was different. He walked through the band door with a huge smile on his face but I couldn't help but look away and frown. Mixed emotions are the worst, he does one thing and you love him and he does another thing that drives you insane and makes you want to hurt him. He sits right behind me in band and I am constantly turning around to talk to him but we never seem to get in trouble except for @DATE, we were supposedly talking to much. I don't believe we were talking to much, because @DATE was where I wanted nothing to do with him. He was upset with me and I was upset with him, so we were even. Twenty-five minutes passed by, each minute dragging on longer and all I was thinking about was him and what I had heard he was doing. It's never a good feeling when you know something is wrong. I confronted him about what people were telling me. His response was ""don't believe what you hear, believe what you see."" I didn't know what was going on, but tears started pouring out of my eyes, running down my face like a crystal clear waterfall. I asked my teacher if i could take a minute out in the hall, and she agreed, so I sat in the hall, with tears running down my face. One of my friends walked out the door and sat with me to comfort me. We started talking and I told her everything that was going on. She gave me a hug, and start making jokes about him. I couldn't help but laugh. I even smiled and made my own remarks that got her to laugh as well. After a few jokes, and a bunch of hugs, the tears went away and I was smiling. Neither of us wanted to go back in class but we didn't really have any other options. We weren't very close friends, but our talk during class, made us grow stronger. Even when everything is going wrong, you should count on your friends to tell you the truth, and give their advice, because they are always right so don't second guess them. They know how to make you feel better and it always seems to work. Laughter is much more than an emotion. It gives you strength when you are weak. It builds you up when you are down. Laughter brings relationships closer, and sometimes all we need is to smile. Laughter also helps create memories, the nights you stay up talking and laughing until two in the morning are the ones you will remember forever. Laughter is an important aspect to everyone, we all need a day to just relax and take a step back to laugh.",20,19,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

My dad claims laughter is the reason for his six pack, it works your muscles. @CAPS is very important in a relationship. If @CAPS don't have any kind of sense of humor, consider yours self inhumane. When it comes to my family, I am always @CAPS. @CAPS is always positive and happiness follows is in life. If I have a problem I think of something that would make me laugh, a laugh is always nice..  Relationships can be created by having things in common, see my dad and I don't always get along. When we laugh everything else is silent, it sets the mood. If @CAPS didn't laugh around my dad he would ask ""@CAPS @CAPS got a sore sense of humor?"" @CAPS again if your not @CAPS with me at something funny, @CAPS must be an outsider. @CAPS is positive and positive energy is good. I laugh a lot, I laugh out loud. @CAPS would not have the relations @CAPS have @DATE if it wasn't for @CAPS. Some people say laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I agree with that statement. If it wasn't for laughter I think that I would be very negative, I would be disciplined more and to think I would be more distant with my dad. As I grow older I see me maturing, I laugh a lot less... My dad also see's the change, we have grown further apart witch is normal with every teenager growing up. My dad is very funny, and even know I'm glad to be growing up I wouldn't trade the world for the humorous relations I have with my dad. Laughter is all around, I see people walking down the street @CAPS on their cell phone. I hear of the phrase ""@CAPS all the way to the bank,"" I would be @CAPS if I was rich too. Being rich is a positive thing, but if @CAPS are not @CAPS and happy in life then money doesn't mean a thing. I could be poor and @CAPS, and still be happy. If @CAPS are not happy in life then everything @CAPS have or worked for means nothing. Laughter brings people togethe,r @CAPS is no doubt. I've met many people by just simply ""@CAPS."" @CAPS will be surprised what @CAPS can get by just putting a smile on your face, or if @CAPS find something funny, ""@CAPS."" I have a very humorous dad, I would not change it. I believe everything happens for a reason, and I believe that everyone deserves a good laugh and to be happy. I think they deserve it, it's unfortunate not everyone is happy in life, so why don't @CAPS personally go out of your way and make someone laugh? @CAPS don't know their situation, it is nearly possible a laugh can take @CAPS many places. @CAPS never know what a laugh will bring @CAPS until @CAPS find out? Laughter is a strong element in relations, and can base a personality profile of someone and who they are.",18,18,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12761,21351,8,"Have you ever seen the phrase @CAPS,@CAPS,Laughter? Have you ever asked yourself what it means? I believe it can mean many different things for many different people. There are some people that can take it negativly andthen there's some that take it positivley i believe that those @NUM words in that phrase are everything you need to have a perfect life. A perfect life isn't about having the best car the most expensive clothes or the nicest physical appearence. Im going to tell you why laughter is very important in any kind of relationship. Im @NUM years old now but i was @NUM when i met the person who makes me laugh no matter the situation. He is a male tall, brown skin. He is @NUM years old now. but he was @NUM when i met him.It all started at school thats where we met. He always made me laugh i remember once i was very upset because i was having some issues at home and being with him was something i needed to actually forget what was going on he is a very honest person and thats what was good about him he would make any situation into a joke. even emberassing things that either happend to me or him he would turn them around to the piont where i wouldn't feel emberassed anymore. I @CAPS it how i can be myself with him. He was the uphill on a rocky roll-a-coaster. @NUM years have gone by and i am now married with that best friend that i had and we have two beautiful twin daughets together and i @CAPS my life to the fullest because he makes me happy. Instead of arguing its laughter and life is just better that way not only it makes me laugh but thats what makes him a good person and other people feel good around him. Laughter not only is good in a male and female relationship but it is also good in a female and female relationship. I have a best friend. not only is she my best friend because she's honest, and kind but because she's funny she makes me laugh we can laugh at the simplist things ever most people @MONTH think we are crazy, we aren't that just the sound of a happy life. I believe a life without laughter is like a straight road boring and long. life with laughter is like a curvey road you just dont know what to expect. My mother and I have a pretty solid relationship we do alot of things together but what i enjoy most is the laughs we have sometimes when something occurs at that momment it might be downhill but a year from that day you look back and its funny its always better to enojy laughing with somebody that you can consider dear to you. Laughing at the memmories is what i enjoy most with anyone because that memory you will always carry with you and sooner or later you are going to laugh at the fact that it happend, when and where. So when ever something happens to you that you @MONTH consider emberassing look back at it a year from that day im sure you will get a laugh or atleast a smile out of it.

I spent most my time playing with my brothers, @PERSON, @CAPS, and @CAPS. We did everything together, from caching frogs to eating bugs. We had just moved to a new house, and my dad had a lot of stuff to do to make it a safe and fun environment. His first thing he had to do, was to build a pull @CAPS, which is a building on top of a garage. He started by poring cement on to the freshly bulldozed land. He made square holes in the cement to put the poles in, so it would hold the @CAPS up. Then he started to make the main building on top of the garage he made. I was so exited to see my dad building this @CAPS with his bare hands. Once he made the whole inside safe i was let in. I walked in and was amazed by how beautiful it was, and how perfectly built it was. But there was still stuff to do. My dad and my oldest brother @PERSON were putting the shingles on, so the rain and other crap could not get in. The next day I woke up to them hooting and hollering, like a bunch of chickens when they lay their first egg. They just finished the pull @CAPS. I sprung to my feet like a cat that just got shot by an air-soft gun, and ran down stairs to meet them. When they came in, it looked like they fell in a pond. They were soaked in sweat. Right away my brothers and I ran as fast as we could to the brand new @CAPS @CAPS. When we entered the @CAPS, we felt a weird sensation, like if something just got cold and wet on our feet. Then we know what we had just done, we had just ran on the freshly painted floor. We all looked at each other and started trying to find away back with making the least mess. We walked backwards in our previous foot prints. When we finally reached the stairs, we had to find a way to cover our mess we had just made, or else we would be in a lot of trouble. So we all came up with a plan, it was to paint over our foot prints with the left over paint. So right away we started to paint over our mess we had made, with the left over paint we found from the project. Soon we were all done, and it was a great relief that we would not get cot.  Later that day my dad and older brother went to the @CAPS to see if the paint had dried. to their surprise they sow a bunch of little foot prints on the stairs leading to the freshly painted floor. As they went up the stairs they kept seen more and more foot prints. Ones they reached the top they looked at the wet floor and they only sow wet paint, no foot prints. As all this is happening my brothers and i were watching from our window, we could see everything. Soon we sow them coming back so we went down to meet them. As they walked in i could see a puzzled look on there face, it was a look of confusion. They entered the door and looked right at me, it was like if i just stole a hundred dollars and just got cot. My dad politely said ""can i see your feet?"" ""@CAPS"" i replied with a scared face. I showed him my feet and then he said ""did you perhaps go in the @CAPS @CAPS, then try to fix your mess by painting over it?"" I looked at him with a dumb face and said ""@CAPS"". He just had a great big smile and said, ""go wash your feet"". Later that day the floor dried and we all went up there and ate dinner.",17,20,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0

12765,21356,8," In all of the times people paid a lot of attention to laughter. We can't imagine our lives without @CAPS. We @CAPS every day, make jokes,smile. For me laughter always was one of the best things in the world! @CAPS helped me so many times in the most difficult situations. I want to tell you one story of my life when laughter played a huge role.@CAPS all started @DATE in @DATE. I was living in @LOCATION at that time and was trying to get a scholarship to go to the @LOCATION for one @DATE as an exchange student. To do this I had to pass a lot of tests, to write millions of essays, go through all the paper work... One of the things that i had to do was to talk to the group of other participants and two @CAPS for about one hour. So, people who chose the kids to go abroad will look at how we can communicate with others. Can you imagine speaking foreign language with group of people who you have never seen before? No. Especially when all of you know that only one from the whole group will go to @LOCATION. You know that everyone will try to be the best, the leader, and hardly ever will let others to say something. But I still hoped everything would be fine.I remember that day as if @CAPS was yesterday. Everything in details. @CAPS was @DATE @TIME, when I came into the white big building of @ORGANIZATION where the competition was going to be.I came in the class and two @CAPS introduces us to each other. And at that exact moment, when I saw other three people, at that exact second I realized that I actually had to worry! I saw their faces. They thought the same. We had nothing in common. At all. They all looked different. One girl was all in black. No kidding. black big shoes looked alike to old army ones that my grandfather has, black skirt was longer then the girl, black ties, dark t-shirt, three or four sizes bigger then the girl; you can not even imagine how dark her short straight hair were. She looked like if she was a part of the darkest night of the @DATE. Another girl was a complete ""barbie girl"". You know, typical @CAPS- two good for everyone. She was tall, thin, long blond hair and pink clothes. All pink. Bright-pink jeans, light-pink top and high heels. I remember her saying the girl in black something like "" @CAPS, I am the best one here"". Nothing else about her, just @CAPS. Also there was one boy. He was a wonderful example of rap person. All his look from shoes to attitude were just screaming about how much he likes rap. No, loves rap. Big blue jeans, cool in rep companies @ORGANIZATION shoes, white tee-shirt with a face of popular in @LOCATION rap musician, a hoodoo and a big hat. Also, he had a backpack and i was able to hear music from his I-pod. Well, me, I was in new green pants, grey top, black cardigan, nice grey purse and black flats.. I looked like a girl who loves style, I guess. I can not tell you what they thought about me. I just don not know. But I'm pretty sure that I was a person who just reads magazines all the time and watching @CAPS fashion shows. So, we all looked super different from each other and seemed as we were interested just in our own thing. And in nothing else.I didn't understand how we were able to be in the same group. But we were. The first ten minutes were awkward. We did not know what to talk about since we all were so different. Two @CAPS who were making notes on how how our conversation is going decided to help us.They gave us a random word, something like "" jungadzhumba"" and told us to think about what @CAPS is and to perform @CAPS. That seemed to be an interesting thing to me but not for others. The girl-in-black said that @CAPS is stupid. And then, the next second the thing that changed everything happened. The boy said a joke about @CAPS. Yes, just a joke, and i do not even remember what @CAPS was, the only thing is that @CAPS was really funny. We started to @CAPS. And the laughter helped us. We were talking so long, more than one hour, but @CAPS seemed for us so fast! We were talking about everything in the world! So many topics, we were talking in that room, and then after in the restaurant, and in the subway on the way home... @CAPS was wonderful time! That day is very important for me now, because at that day I realized that laughter is a key for everything. I've heard @CAPS before, but the real understanding was at that @DATE. Now my favorite phrase is: ""@CAPS, if you don't know what to do, just @CAPS!"" @CAPS will help you.",17,20,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12766,21357,8,"Laughter is an amazing feeling. @CAPS feel good, @CAPS feel wonderful, happy, secure, and loved. It is what brings the best out of people, in my opinion. People laugh to show a sense of humor, and to show love. I am more of a depressed person, and my therepst always told me,  ""@CAPS don't want wrinkles, so smile, and laugh it out.""I predict that laughing is what makes people who they really are. When @CAPS are mad, or even sad. What do @CAPS want to do? I don't think @CAPS would want to be grouchy all day? I would think @CAPS would want your friends or family make @CAPS laugh, so @CAPS can get over what your upset about, move on and be happy. In life, nothing is more important than love, and laughter. There is no love with no laughter. No laughter without love. We need one another to keep our days going. Especially for those who have been through a lot in life. Like me. I have family problems, I'm a sophomore, yet I am still standing tall with a bright smile on my face. I know, that everything will be @CAPS fine, @CAPS I @CAPS laugh it out. It makes me feel safe, makes me feel like, I am needed in this world. I ve have been through so much, that others look up to me. Wwhen it comes to that, I know exactly @CAPS what to do. Make them laugh. Nothing stands out more beautiful than a human laughing. A lot of people has always wondered how I could be so strong, because of all the horrible situations I have been through since middle school. Aand I tell them, ""@CAPS laugh it out. It makes @CAPS feel way better in the end."" I mean, @CAPS @MONTH feel silly when your done laughing, but also feel great. That @CAPS can @CAPS laugh, and move on. Because it is life. Notihng is perfect, things will get messed up, people come and go. There will be tears, and there will be laughter. When it comes to an end, let it go. Laugh, and @CAPS be happy that he/she was once yours. Memories last forever, cherish every moment @CAPS have, laugh and live life as it is, because it is too short to waste time, and frown. Laughter is the beauty of a person's voice. Some are high, and some are low. Some are loud, some are very quiet, and giggly.I have a loud mouth. Also a loud laugh. I am very tiny, yet the volume that comes out of me when I laugh makes @CAPS so surprised. I entertain people with my laugh, depending on my mood, my laugh will change tone. Sometimes @CAPS can say my laugh is annoying, but I'm not afraid to laugh. I'm not, so don't be afraid, speak out, and like text messages that @CAPS sends to eachother, laugh out loud. Everything will be okay. It takes a lot of strength to make me stop laughing. Because I am a ""blonde."" @CAPS says. No matter what, I'll always be laughing. In fourth grade my teacher once said,  ""@CAPS @CAPS laugh a lot. @CAPS will live life longer.""I still remember it from then on, I still, and will believe in that quote. Laughter is what makes me who I am today, and it has made me become a better, and stronger person. The most common thing that people do is laugh. @CAPS can walk down the hall, in the mall, next door, outside, at a park, where ever else. There will always be people lauhging, and sharing jokes all over the world. I'm glad people can speak through laughter.",20,21,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0
12767,21358,8,"Laughter is a @CAPS @CAPS do things like music, tears and laughter have in common? @CAPS're all universal languages- @CAPS surpass any @CAPS barriers to get the point across without words. @CAPS was definitely the case the time my @CAPS's best friend @PERSON came to visit from @LOCATION.  I was eight at the time. I'd lived in @LOCATION all my life, and hearing other languages wasn't something that happened on a regular basis. When my @CAPS announced that her college roommate @PERSON was coming for a few days along with her family, I felt some apprehension at the idea of trying to talk to them. However, my @CAPS was encouraging. ""@CAPS will be a learning experience!"" was her enthusiastic war cry any time I whined. ""@CAPS'll learn some @CAPS, and @CAPS'll learn some @CAPS.""  @CAPS was a cold, stormy @ORGANIZATION day when @CAPS arrived. As @CAPS pulled their blue minivan into our driveway, I @CAPS felt shy. After all, I only had faint memories of my ""@CAPS"" @PERSON's visit years ago, and I'd never met the rest of her family. However, my sense of worry was soon replaced by @CAPS @PERSON's rich voice: ""@CAPS! @CAPS've gotten so tall!"" @CAPS I was enfolded in her warm embrace, and I smelled the familiar smell of my @CAPS: chocolate, detergent, and something spicy as if she'd just been cooking. Soon @ORGANIZATION had moved on to greeting my younger sister and I was left awkwardly standing next to @ORGANIZATION's three children. I realized that I didn't know @CAPS to say- or even how to say anything to them. While @PERSON was bilingual, yet she didn't speak @CAPS around her children. There was a total @CAPS barrier. The awkwardness passed momentarily when the adults intervened. @PERSON bustled into our silent mass and began introducing us. Her oldest was tall, dark haired @PERSON, who was the ancient and worldly age of twelve. Closest to my age was nine year old @CAPS, who had a quick smile and a mischievous glint in her eye. The youngest, @PERSON, was petite even for her tender age of four. I smiled and nodded as each was introduced, and smiled and nodded some more as @PERSON introduced me and my sister @CAPS to them. As @CAPS chattered back at her in @CAPS, I marveled at how clever @CAPS seemed for speaking another @CAPS. How, I wondered, did my @CAPS sound to them?  My @CAPS soon ushered us into the house. She had begun making dinner, and @PERSON joined her in our small kitchen to ""catch up on life."" For a while, we kids stayed close to our parents, like birds hesitating to leave the nest. Soon, however, @CAPS became apparent that seven people was too many to fit in one kitchen. ""@CAPS don't @CAPS go show them your rooms?"" my @CAPS suggested. ""@CAPS still haven't met @CAPS!"" @CAPS seemed like a good idea, since @CAPS, our cat, was friendly to anyone and everyone. @CAPS and I led the way to to find him while the @CAPS talked in hushed @CAPS voices behind us.  As we got to the living room, @PERSON @CAPS let out a squeal. She ran across the floor to @CAPS, who had been napping in the sun. I was worried that she would startle him, but the overweight tabby simply got up sleepily and yawned. And then, to our amazement, @CAPS did something he'd never done before. He jumped up and placed his hind legs on @PERSON's chest. He was a large cat, and she was small, so @CAPS turned out so that he was looking her in the eye. For a moment, @CAPS looked at each other, surprised, and then she fell down into a sitting position. Worried she might cry, I started to go over to help, but then something entirely different escaped out of her mouth: the contagious laugh of a four year old. For a moment, there was a surprised silence from the rest of us as she howled at the hilarity of @CAPS, but soon we couldn't help but join in. And in that moment, I realized that we didn't even have to learn each other's languages- the laughter that we'd shared had broken the ice and the @CAPS barrier.  I still remember that visit fondly today, because @CAPS's the first time that I realized how alike other cultures are to our own. True, we had a hard time relating at the beginning. But by the end, we had become friends, all because of a cat, a four year old, and the one @CAPS we did have in common- laughter.",23,23,0.0,46,0.0,0.0,0.0,46.0

Later on we went on our ways to look at a different store, I was at one store while my brother was at another. As I was about to make a purchase I felt a tap on my shoulder and I looked and saw a guy that was working at the last store we were at with two cops with him. I was curious why he was talking to me.  He said to me ""hey where is the hat you stole from my store?"" ""I didn't steal a hat bro"" I answered back. ""@CAPS you did, we got it on tape that you had the hat."" said the guy. "" @CAPS dude I did not take a hat"" I replied. ""@CAPS.k. then what about your brother, where is he?"" questioned the guy. I told him where he was and he went there with one of the cops while the other stayed with me while I was making a purchase. At this point I was pretty upset that my brother and I were accused of stealing a hat. The cops started to ask me questions that were personal. I told I wanted to talk to my dad and tell him what is happening. My dad was pretty upset that my brother and I were accused of stealing. My dad was asking me questions of what happened, I told him the truth of what happened. As the cop, my dad and I were walking back to watch the film of the whole incident. We saw my brother walking back with the other cop.  ""I'm good to go, the video shows me putting the hat back on the rack"" said my brother. I was still upset that the guy who worked at the store did not watch the whole film only bits and pieces of it. The guy apologized to my dad and I. I was still mad, because the guy did watch the whole film, and I didn't want the people who saw me with the cop to think I was a troubled kid. As my brother and I look back at this experience we laugh about it and make jokes. There is @CAPS reason to be mad about we didn't steal the hat and we knew it. Laughter makes us forget about it. I think without our laughter about it this, could have been different. Laughter makes experiences more fun there is always something to laugh about. It feels like you are take a bunch of weight of your shoulder makes you relived. I could have called the manager about how I felt, and what the guy did with the video, but I just forget about it and crack a few jokes to make myself laugh about it.",18,17,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0

I got out of bed, as I usually do. I ate my breakfast, went to the bathroom, and brushed my teeth. I left the house feeling a bit tired but great. As I walked to my bus stop, I watched people go by, saying @CAPS every now and then. When I got to my bus stop, @CAPS one was there. I thought that maybe the bus had already come and picked the kids up.  I waited and waited. Almost fifteen minutes went by. I was starting to get worried. If I had missed the bus, I couldn't go to @ORGANIZATION. My parents worked until the @TIME and there was @CAPS one to drive me there. I then decided to walk to the next stop. @CAPS one was there either. By that time, I was sure that the bus had come earlier and left me behind. I started to walk back to my house. When I got there, I opened the door and went to check the @ORGANIZATION calender hanging on the wall. There was nothing written on @DATE. @CAPS was a normal @ORGANIZATION day.  @CAPS could I have missed the bus? I never miss the bus! I started to ask myself of other possibilities. Maybe there were weather problems and the schools got closed. That wasn't possible because the weather was great. Maybe something happened to the bus, like an accident and @CAPS couldn't come, but that wasn't @CAPS either because then the kids would have been at their bus stops. The more I thought about @CAPS, the less @CAPS made sense to me. What was going on that day? I got frustrated. I set my backpack down so that I could look for my daily planner. I opened @CAPS up and searched for the @ORGANIZATION's phone number. Then, I took the phone and called the @ORGANIZATION. ""@CAPS've reached @ORGANIZATION,"" a woman on the phone said. "" @CAPS @MONTH I help @CAPS?"" ""@CAPS, I'm a student there and I was wondering if something was wrong because I didn't see the bus today?"" I said. There was a moment of silence. The woman didn't answer me. This was making me angry. ""@CAPS, are @CAPS still there?"" I asked, with anger showing through my voice. Nothing. Then, the woman started laughing. @CAPS laughed for almost a minute. This had made me mad. What had I said that would make her laugh like that? ""Was @CAPS something that I said?"" I asked. ""@CAPS, @CAPS, I'm so sorry,"" @CAPS said, trying to keep herself from laughing. "" @CAPS, @CAPS's just that, do @CAPS know what day is today?"" ""@CAPS's @DATE, isn't @CAPS?"" @CAPS laughed again. ""@CAPS, today isn't @DATE, @CAPS's @DATE."" I was shocked to hear that. I had spent all of my time trying to figure out what had happened. The only possibility that I hadn't thought of was that @CAPS was @DATE. I felt like an idiot. I set down the phone and started to laugh.

I love to laugh, whether it is about something, at something, about someone, at someone, a funny event, a funny face, or just a funny joke. I heard once that the more you laugh the longer you live; if that is true I'm gonna live forever. I'm going to tell you a story about laughter because it is a big part of my life.  I laugh the most when I am with my family and friends. They are all very funny people that are cracking jokes any chance they get. There hasn't been one family gathering or friend hangout where I didn't laugh. A very funny moment in my life that I will never forget is the time my sister and I were starting to get to know our new step-mom, @CAPS.We were all playing this game where one person throws a football into a group of people, and whoever catches it gets the amount of points the thrower calls out. We were all getting points left and right; however, @CAPS wasn't doing so hot. She came up with a plan that she said would make her win. Actually, it just ended with all of us on the floor crying from laughing so hard. I had thrown the ball and called out ""@NUM points!"" @CAPS turned around. My eyes opened wide. Shayna screamed in laughter as @CAPS had pulled down her pants to moon us. The foot ball hits the grass, as do all of us.We laughed until our stomachs ached and our eyes watered. I really think that moment brought all of us closer together. I believe laughter brings everyone closer together.  My boyfriend and I are very close because we laugh all the time; it is a very big part of our relationship. Just think for a minute. All the emotions that we humans have and deal with on a regular basis, which one is truly universal? We can love, cry, feel hate and disrespect. Most of us have sympathy and empathy, but the one true feeling we humans share with and between another person is a smile along with laughter. If you can give a person a reason to laugh, then you have connected and made a mile into an inch. It's even bigger than that. The internet has provided us in ways to reachout through laughter. Not just in miles, but in counties. You-tube is a social network of laughter. I have put many funny videos on you-tube and watched many that made me laugh. One day I made this video of my friends and I playing @CAPS. It was so funny I thought I would put it on you-tube. I shared it with my mom who laughed very hard. She shared it with family who shared it with co workers who shared it with there family and friends.They all laughed.Laughter is all around. Laughter can start in one place like @PERSON and reach out all the way to @LOCATION.  Laughter also isn't always a good thing. People can go from laughing at a funny joke to laughing and making fun of a kid on the play ground. Laughter doesn't always feel good, if you're the one being laughed at. I don't like to think of laughed that way. I like to remember all the times I laughed and shared that special moment with a loved one.  Laughter is in my everyday schedule. I would have to write a book in order to tell you all the times that laughter was one element in my life because it happens every day. I enjoy laughter. I hope you do,too.",20,25,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12771,21365,8," People say ""laughter can cure anything"", @CAPS you know what I totally believe it to. There has been multiple times when I was sad or angry that someone made me laugh, and I have made almost everyone I know laugh when they were down our frustrated. Now, many people have made me laugh throughout my whole sixteen years that i have been alive. To be completely honest, I only really remember one moment in my life that really laughter was all I needed to pull me back to reality. My best friend @PERSON really knew what i need to help me out. her humor made my life real again, and because of it I was able to except life. It was @DATE, when I got really upset because I knew that the guy I loved since seventh grade wouldn't date me again. His reason for this was because he didn't want to ruin our great and close friendship. Just because he said that didn't mean I would just give up. I tried @CAPS to win him back, but it just seemed like nothing was working. At this point I knew I needed to talk to my best friend, so I text-ed @PERSON. I told her @CAPS I was doing, and how none of it was working. If you knew @PERSON, you would know that @CAPS sees a bright side to anything @PERSON told me at that time, ""@PERSON, you can have any guy ion the world, and yet, you can't seem to realize it. I don't know about you, but you must be really @CAPS sick!"" @CAPS said that once or twice because @CAPS knew it was true. I still just couldn't except what @CAPS was telling me. that never stopped me from smiling or laughing though. I'll admit those words really dried my tears up. and helped me move forward. Now it is @DATE time, school is out, and it's time for me to step my game up. I was still trying to win @PERSON, the @CAPS of my life back. Once again I tried @CAPS! I even asked @PERSON to ask @PERSON if he still had feelings for me. He never gave her an answer. When I asked @PERSON for more advice, @CAPS responded like usual. ""@PERSON, @PERSON is just one guy, there are plenty of guys out there for you. You just need to look and stop trying for just one guy"". This got me thinking. @CAPS @CAPS is totally right, I just need to find a guy that makes me feel the same way @PERSON makes me feel. Don't get me wrong though, even though @PERSON was trying to be serious, I couldn't help but smile a little, and giggle. As I was giggling, I though t to myself. I still @CAPS @PERSON like crazy. It's the beginning of @DATE, and I am just relaxing at my house like usual, when I get a text from @PERSON saying he might be moving to @LOCATION. I just started bawling like a baby who is hungry. I quickly text ed @PERSON to tell her, but @CAPS already knew. I had one more plan to win @PERSON back, and I told @PERSON all about it. My plan is to ask @PERSON if he wants to hike @CAPS. Pisqah with me before he moves. When we hiked all the way to the top I am going to tell him how I truly still feel about him, then I am going to kiss him.m @CAPS @PERSON read this, her first response was, "" @CAPS shoot girly, aren't you just a spitball of @CAPS and romance!"" I almost peed my pants when I read that. It was hysterical! My plan never happened because @PERSON ended up not moving thankfully. Quintin and I still haven't got back together, but I am fine with that. His and I's friendship has grown tremendously. I'll admit though that I can't help but flirt with him a lot. Luckily though, I had my best friend @PERSON to talk to. @CAPS is the reason my tears and moans turned to tears of happiness and laughter. @PERSON's humor brought me to except-ants. laughter kept me in perspective of @CAPS. I owe all my thanks to @PERSON, who kept me from going insane or crazy about @CAPS. Laughter helped mend my heart, and change my whole life dramatically. ",19,18,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0

A trail of paint followed me as I tried to hop from one clear spot on the floor to the next, but there weren't many clear spots. All that I could think of, was if I was going to make @CAPS to high school, or not. Trying my hardest not to get anymore paint on the ground, I opened the door carefully, and called out. ""@CAPS...Hey mom?"" I yelled half-halfheartedly, as I glanced back at the ""painted"" room.  ""@CAPS?"" she hollered back up the stairs.My mouth wouldn't open, I was afraid to answer. I've messed up millions of times, but none have been this bad.  ""@CAPS, you see... I've had a paint withdraw from the paint pan."" I replied softly, hoping she would not hear me.  ""A paint withdraw?"" she asked in a confused tone, as she walked up the stairs to see what has happened. I closed my eyes in fear as she turned the corner.My mind raced as I tried to prepare myself for a rant about how I have to be more careful, and punishment. Neither came. She started to crack up.  I was @CAPS confused at the sight of my mom sitting on the floor, almost peeing her pants. I then realized that I was probably a sight to see. I was covered in paint from head to toe. I started to giggle as I took in the situation, only something like this would happen to me. Minutes later we finial got a hold of ourselves and mom went to go get some paper towels to clean up my mess.  She came back upstairs carrying a role of paper towels and a plastic garbage bags.""@CAPS thing I put the plastic covering over everything, before I let you paint."" she stated, smiling at me. ""@CAPS would have been way worse, if I spilled the paint all over the carpet."" I replied, returning her smile. I started to gather up the plastic covering, revealing the unsoiled carpet. The garbage-can was as full as a stuffed @LOCATION on @CAPS. After we gathered up the last of the plastic covering, I slammed the garbage-cans lid as I put the last bit of plastic covering in. My mom came in carrying @CAPS, and a handful of paper-towels.  ""@CAPS what made the paint pan have sudden withdraw of paint, @CAPS?, @CAPS you trip on the plastic covering, or drop the paintbrush in the pan?"" she questioned me, as she gave me a confused facial expression.  I didn't know what to say. "" I...@CAPS, @CAPS, I was on my way to paint the edges against the ceiling, when I took my first step on the ladder and slipped. Landing in the paint pan and receiving the paintbrush in my face"" I didn't mention the fact that I tripped on my shoelace. My mom always got on me, for leaving my shoes untied. My mom started to laugh uncontrollably again. She started to turn beat-red. I could not believe her reaction. The situation was @CAPS funny, I started to laugh again as-@CAPS. Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined anyone forgiving me in such a big way.  Once we finally stopped laughing, my mom and I finished cleaning the mess. My mom and I remember this day as a time we got to bond. I now realize that my mom will understand, and forgive me for my mistakes, no matter how big they are. ",20,21,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0

It had worked several @CAPS but the reality was that some how adults could outsmart ""my sickness"". As a kid I was a perfect actor but apparently my acting skills were fading. All the staff new me by then and by now it was harder for me to make my ways out. I remember being in forth grade when I made an appearance at the office but not really by choice and in my innocence I never knew what could happen next. My cousin @PERSON and I were in the same classes, we used to look alike when we were kids and teachers would often confuse who we were because we looked like twins. One day my cousin was struggling with a couple math problems and @PERSON, our math teacher decided to stay a few minutes after school to help her. However we also use to ride the same bus and I decided to wait for her in order to catch the bus together. Those few minutes became more and once @PERSON was out we had already missed the bus. That's when we made our appearance in the office and there she was the chunky old lady that new me by heart. I would always remember her sitting in a chair in front of the computer and filling out some papers.This time she knew it wasn't one of those ""wanna go home"" days. ""We missed the bus"" we said, she then asked us why, we both gave our explanations. In the meantime she called @PERSON to make sure we were telling the truth. When @PERSON showed up, the office lady explained what we had said, but the problem was that she confused our explanations thinking we both missed the bus for the same reason making me look like a liar. When @PERSON heard this she said that I wasn't telling the truth and when I tried to explain to her that the lady had been mistaken there was no use even my cousin tried to defend me but the office lady said she was sure of what I had said. Being a kid and all I felt ashamed even though I knew I was telling the truth. Mrs. @PERSON decided to give me a demerit but deep inside I knew I said the truth and that's what matters.   As a kid it seems like the end of the world in these situations. Feeling anger because I wasn't able to do anything about it but now that I look back it brings a smile to my face because in my poor judgment I could just think of the teacher as being mean but now I see that it was just a big misunderstanding. Now around @NUM years have passed and this memory is still with me but I only get the best of it. When I hang out with my cousin @PERSON the base of our conversations are these funny moments of our childhood that only bring laughter, just remembering the foolish things we did when we were young. Sharing these moments bring us closer not only as a family but as friends and there is no better thing than enjoying moments of long lasting laughter with the people we love.""",19,20,0.0,39,0.0,0.0,0.0,39.0

In a happy relationship comes laughter,the first thing I do wen I meet someone I always smiling and telling jokes because if I tell jokes and they are laughing they know that I am a happy person. If you meet any person weather it is a grown up to a friend to a person you want to go out with they will always enjoy laughter. Lets just say me and my girlfriend when I first saw her she was sitting in a desk in my history class crying and I asked if she is okay and she told me her story after she told me her story I told her how it feel and then I told her a joke and she laughed.After she got done laughing she ask me for my phone number and then that night we started dating. I asked her what she likes about me and she said the way I make her laugh.  I always love to make my family and friends laugh because if they smile it makes me smile. I use laughter as a way to make people feel better about themselves and my self. If the world can learn to laugh and be happy it would be a better place because I rather laugh and be happy then be mad or sad about something. when I was growing up I was by myself all the time so i had to learn how to keep myself happy so I would think about funny stuff I have seen or said in the past and try to make a story about it and it worked.When I got older i started doing stand up comedy.

I am lost, and I am losing myself the more I pounce into life. Isolate myself from the world, sleep in a bed of tear soaked tissues, and stare at my face in the mirror that I despise so much.

12776,21373,8," In the ninth grade I was required to give a speech about a book. The speech was to be persuasive, like a television or radio advertisement. I am awful at giving speeches. Before speeches my hands get clammy and cold, I experience ""hot flashes,"" and occasionally get nauseous. During speeches my eyes frantically glance around the room, my breathing pattern changes to quick short breathes. Almost in sync with my glances. At the end of my speeches I begin shaking and am nearly in a state of shock. I do not speak, I do not laugh, and I feel like hiding. Luckily, @CAPS speech was different. My @CAPS class had all girls and one boy. Not to say I am sexist, but having the majority of the room being female did help. Girls have a way of acceptance, or at least creating a facade of acceptance, and that does make me feel relaxed and calmer.  So when the time came for me to stand up in front of the room nearly everyone in the class had a slight smile of ambition and readiness to listen to what I had to say. Everyone was making eye contact with me. Compared to the average classroom setting of ""speech giving time,"" (when people are doodling or mouthing words to each other) the classroom was zoned in on me. Today @CAPS felt like everyone was ready to hear me no matter what I really had to say, and how professional @CAPS came out. I felt superior, as if I had the power to alter their lives, almost so superior that I could spit propaganda at them and they would eat @CAPS up (@CAPS't that what advertisment is? Telling a group of people the good things about a product or idea, and hiding the bad things?). The group looked so innocent. Today I was ready to give my speech, just because of that spark of acceptance, and a smile. I began. My speech was told with puppets with a cardboard box around @CAPS to serve the purpose of a television. @CAPS also made me feel better because all the audience saw was my puppets and all they heard was the voices of the ""actors."" @CAPS the first few lines of the speech my group of classroom peers laughed, @CAPS was not what they had expected. I am a shy, quiet girl who barely has the courage to raise her hand in class. I wear things like semi-large coats to set a barrier between myself and the world. A lot of times when I give speeches people laugh, but usually a negative laugh. The kind of laugh that the teacher has to hush everyone. @CAPS's also the kind of laugh that makes me cut my speech shorter, that just makes the speech a introduction and an ending, bodiless. So for me to break out of my shell was a big step in what most think of as the correct direction. The sound of @CAPS laughter coaxed me to continue forward with my speech.  At the end of my speech everyone clapped. They always clap. @CAPS is required to clap. @CAPS clap was different, @CAPS was clapping for the success of the speaker, a clap that said ""@CAPS speech had a clear purpose, and made the audience want to keep listening."" @CAPS was not a pity clap. Then I smiled. My smile represented that I knew I had succeeded. That I had gotten a group of people together and focused on hearing what I had to say, and that they had comprehended @CAPS, and maybe that they would now want to read the book. @CAPS was one of the first speeches I had ever met all of the requirements on. The length of the speech was good, not long enough to make the audience fall asleep and not quick enough for them to forget the true purpose of the speech. I enunciated all of my words so everyone could understand what I was saying, @CAPS was a definite improvement, and also a factor of why they laughed. They could hear my witty jokes and comments. Lastly, my puppets also had a introduction, body, and conclusion to their babble. Usually I get so nervous I forget to say the body of the speech. Laughter can be mean, cruel and disrespectful. My speech story is an example of how laughter can effect people positively. The laughter of the audience was cheery, happy, encouraging, and accepting.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

The other boys at school would laugh at @ORGANIZATION for being so much smaller than themselves. He was never the fastest, strongest, or coolest but he was the smartest. He knew how to twist and turn any phrase to make himself feel superior to others. @ORGANIZATION was in truth lonely, he had never laughed or felt the cool touch of a lover. He wished dearly that he could be more outgoing to the point where a girl would fall in love with him. There was in fact a girl he had his eye on for months, her name was @PERSON. She was the most beautiful girl he had have laid eyes on. He had followed her all over town, and rode his bicycle past her almost everyday when she was with her friend @CAPS. @ORGANIZATION hated @CAPS for he had gotten to be with @PERSON everyday, and got to hold her and talk to her. @ORGANIZATION had envied @CAPS for around four months before he had messaged her on a website called ""myyeabook"" a place to meet new people and make friends. @ORGANIZATION had sent her a friend request and asked for her digits. Hoping she would find him attractive and let him text her. @PERSON accepted his request and sent him a message saying ""@CAPS I see your from the town next to mine, we should hang out sometime it would be cool."" @ORGANIZATION had almost lost it when he had read this, he went and got a hair cut, and new clothes just so that she would think he was attractive and cool. @PERSON had went to the park with her friend @PERSON and waited for this fellow named @ORGANIZATION. She and @PERSON had played on the swings, and spun each other on the spinning wheel. @ORGANIZATION had been riding his bike and set it down a hundred yards away from where they were. He walked over said ""@CAPS."" to @PERSON and proceeded to walk over to @LOCATION. He told her he thought she was beautiful and had an amazing smile. @PERSON blushed and asked him if he wanted to swing for a while. @PERSON took off home, seeing that @PERSON was going to be okay with this guy, and little did they know, they were made for each other. @ORGANIZATION let his guard down and told her some jokes, he laid out his life story almost with her, he was so comfortable around her and he didn't know why. @PERSON felt the same way, she laughed at his jokes, and told him her life story. In this one short meeting they had connected on a level that was far from their ages. @ORGANIZATION found out that @PERSON was smart, and loved to be outdoors, she was practically the female version of himself. After a month of conversation and hanging out off and on, @ORGANIZATION sent @PERSON a text message saying ""@CAPS you down to be my partner in life?"" @PERSON was stunned and excited that @ORGANIZATION wanted her to be his girlfriend. @PERSON simply replied ""@CAPS you down to be mine?"" @ORGANIZATION replied back to her ""I love you."" @PERSON was the happiest girl in the world that night of @DATE, @NUM @DATE. The two went everywhere together and did everything together, everyone knew that they were perfect for each other. @PERSON began to fall in love with @ORGANIZATION and after four months of being together told him finally. @ORGANIZATION was so elated that he went out and bought her a ring, and she graciously accepted it. @PERSON and @ORGANIZATION moved in together and started a family. A little laughter can go a long way, in anything you do, a job, a family, or even in the hopes of finding your perfect someone. @PERSON and @ORGANIZATION found that their love had come from that day many months ago in that park, laughing about even the smallest of things such as a corny joke, or an adventure of another can lead the way to a lifetime of true love.

My @CAPS reassured me as I reluctantly walked onto the bus. As I scanned the seats it became apparent to me that I needed to try to make new friends or live out my fourth grade career a loner. The bus ride was a quiet one, I did not talk to anyone nor did they talk to me. The school day started like any other. First the teacher assigned everyone their seats in groups of two, I sat by a boy named @PERSON. At first I thought my school life would remain a solo one, I wasn't sure what my seating partners problem was but no words were being exchanged. The rest of the day went by rather fast, before I knew it it was over. I had made it though my first day of school. The bus ride home was not much different than the ride to school, as I got off the bus at my house my mother was there to ask how my day went. After telling her all about it she said that I should try to just be myself and eventually I would make friends. It was @DATE, I got up that morning with a sense of new found motivation. I got ready for the day and waited at my bus stop, I kept waiting for almost a half hour before I went to my mom. After phoning the school we discovered that my bus had been in a minor accident so I had to be driven to school that day. My mom was surprised but told me to get into the car and she would take me to school, just as we were pulling out of our driveway I notice @PERSON, my seating partner, was waiting at his bus stop oblivious to what had happened. Screeching to a halt my mom rolled down her window to ask him if he wanted a ride. At first he seemed unsure but he took us up on the offer. The car ride was spent in silence, listening to the radio. We made it to school and me and @PERSON start walking to class. I don't know what got into me but I felt like running down the sidewalk to our classroom. Sprinting down the sidewalk while @PERSON is watching, I almost made it to class until one of the teachers decided to open their door. At full speed I ran head first into the door and fell backwards onto the sidewalk. After rubbing a major bump on my head I turn around to see @PERSON laughing hysterically. I got somewhat mad at first until I thought about it, and it was probably funny to the onlookers. Scraping my self off the cement I walk over to @PERSON, We laugh about the incident and head to class. That day we spent the entire class talking, even getting into trouble a time of two. Ever since that day @PERSON has been a good friend of mine, its been eight years since we met and there is no end in sight.

All @DATE long we would sit, play, swim, and laugh down at the @CAPS. We would have are @CAPS day party, and calibrate the @CAPS of @DATE down at the @CAPS. There is one day I can remember so well that its like it was yesterday. The last day of school had just ended, my friends and I got on the bus as fast as we could. When the bus stopped at the @CAPS we all started running and striping down to are swim trunks. I was the first one in, as a result I was the first one to relies the water was as cold as the river, it felt like a thousand little nettles stabbing me over and over again. My friends described me as a bouncy ball because I got out as fast as I got in. As soon as my friends saw my blue lips the all started laughing so hard that some of them fell in to the freezing water themselves. After that we walked you to @CAPS house and asked him to turn on the generator, after about an hour the lake was warm enough to swim in. After a we all had swam around for a bit we decided to go of the rope swing. After a while we started doing back flips, when we stopped are backs and chests were as red as the apples in the orchard, and are throats hurt from laughter. As well as being sore from hitting the water over and over again, we were also hungry so we fired up the grill and started making burgers. When the first and second batches resembled a mound of coal, we decided to order pizza. We spent the time by air soft, when the pizza arrived the lake had thousands of air soft @CAPS's floating in it. As we ate we sat on the small dock and stuck are legs in and collected what ever @CAPS's came near. Soon after eating we started playing hide and seek in the orchard. After ten or so rounds we were all scraped up by running throw the trees, so of course we pored soda on are cuts, to this day I still wonder why we did that because it really hurt. Once we were done being stupid we laughed at are self's, then we laughed at each other. It wasn't long before we played swimming base ball, the bases were the corners of the docks and the pitcher was on the floating plat form. we used floating balls and swam from base to base. Eventually the sun started to set and we made a fire by the side of the @CAPS and roasted marshmallows over it. When are @CAPS came to get us we were in the middle of a belly-flop contest. Before we left we promised that we would never forget that day, and that we would be friends forever and laughter would always be the glue. That night I stayed up all night thinking of all the fun and all the laughs we had that day, it was definitely the start of one of the best and one of the most memorable summers of my life.",16,18,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12780,21379,8,"  It was @CAPS @ORGANIZATION of @DATE, the sun was shining and the birds were chirping. It was a great @ORGANIZATION to be outside doing something unique to enjoy the nice weather. There was a parade in @LOCATION, the parade that I was in. I loved being the center of attention, I loved to be seen; and whats a better way for that to happen then being in a parade? I was with my best friend @PERSON and her family. There float was for @ORGANIZATION. Which is the @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION that they had owned at the time.   We had a lot of children on the float, probably about twenty. With only @PERSON, @PERSON's mom, and the manager of the @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION to help watch the kids. The children were dressed up in animal costumes. The older kids were passing out candy while the toddlers were on the float.   @PERSON and I were laughing the whole time, I had almost forgotten that there were hundreds of people watching us. We were carrying the two twin baby's. I cant remember their names. We switched off a few times but for the most part I was holding the boy while she was holding the girl. They were well behaved baby's, they didn't cry often unless we had laughed to hard. Or yelled at the crowd too loudly.  We passed a bunch of people that we knew. I had seen my cousins, and a few aunts and uncles. I could only wave at them because the parade was moving oddly fast. After a while @PERSON and I had started to get tired from holding the baby's and walking around. So we stood at the front of the float and leaned against the wooden rail. The rail was only nailed in so it wasn't very sturdy. We figured that it would be fine though.   The parade continued we started to become even more tired and hot from the sun. We felt like we could have fallen asleep right there in front of everyone. We leaned more and more against the rail from exhaustion. We were still laughing and having a good time, but we became more and more relaxed and ended up with all of our weight pushing against the rail.   Next thing we knew the rail had broken and we fell. There was a bunch of people watching and we were still holding the baby's. At the time I was holding the girl and @PERSON was holding the boy. The boy had just fallen to sleep. The baby's were fine but the boy started to cry, he wasn't hurt he was just shocked. It was the most embarrassing moment that we had ever had.  The crowd started to laugh at us and our faces got beat red. Baileys mom came over to us to make sure we were all okay. She handed the baby's off to the @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION manager who was there. Then @PERSON's mom helped us up. Then we all burst into laughter. Not only was it the most embarrassing moment of our lives, but it was the funniest moment as well. Our butts were sore so we walked funny for the rest of the parade. One time @PERSON even stood up on the float and she went to lean against the rail again until she had realized that it wasn't there anymore.  At the end of the parade @PERSON's family stood there waiting for us. Uncle marks kids, @PERSON and @PERSON, came up and laughed at us and made fun. Papa @PERSON had asked if we were okay. When he asked that @PERSON and I looked at each other and burst into laughter again. Papa just looked puzzled and then joined in our laughter. He was glad that we had just laughed the embarrassment off. Then we went home after that.  That @ORGANIZATION was a good @ORGANIZATION for us. We went home and talked about what had happened. We both realized that if we wouldn't have laughed at our selves then we would have probably ended up crying of embarrassment. We realized that when something bad happens its best to look at the bright side, make a joke out of it, or just laugh at yourself. @PERSON and I have made a fool of our selves many times ever sense, and laughing at our selves had made us much closer.   Every relationship whether its intimate, family, or just friendship needs laughter; or else the tough things in life will bring you down. Laughing is what keeps you bold, and strong. If something embarrassing happens and you don't laugh about it that embarrassing moment can stick with you forever, and it will effect you in the long run. If you were to never laugh in a relationship, then it wouldn't be a relationship at all. That's why laughing is very important in everybody's lives.",18,17,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12781,21380,8," When I was fourteen years old I think my family and I started riding four wheelers out in the sand. My parents friends are the one who got us started riding. The first time I went out there I had a @NUM @ORGANIZATION four wheeler and i couldn't stop laughing because it was so small and everybody had big four wheelers and dirt bikes, but riding out there with that thing was fun and my family would laugh every time my brother rode it up a hill because he would just ride the crap out of that thing. After that ride we sold my four wheeler and got a @NUM @ORGANIZATION. Its the first time going to the dunes with my new four wheeler and I can't wait. We get to the dunes unload everything get our riding gear on and our helmets with our goggles on. It was thirty minutes of riding and my brother was jumping his four wheeler when some people showed up and was video taping him, which made him show off a little bit. So he was jumping in front of those people going further and further every time. My family couldn't stop smiling and laughing because he was showing up everybody there who was trying to out jump him. So when he got don't jumping the guys who were video taping him came up to us and they told us that he is really good and that we should follow them to another jump.So my brother trying to be cool whipped his bike around and wrecked it was funny my dad and I were laughing so hard our eyes were tearing up but lucky for him my dad and I were the only ones to see his little crash. So we went to go see if hes okay and he said yea so we took off. My brother and I were right behind them and our parents were no where in sight. I turned my head to look and see if they were behind us and when I look ahead of me all I see is a roost of sand in my face, which made me turn my handle bars so I hit a grass mound and the bike flew up in the air rolled off a little little hill and landed on my leg, my brother didn't knew he did that to me so I was stranded until my parents came. I don't know why but i couldn't stop laughing because believe it or not that wreck was actually kinda fun and funny because no matter what I did I couldn't seem to get that four wheeler off my leg.  About ten minutes passed by with my four wheeler on my leg and I finally heard a loud noise it was my dad and he came to save me so I told him what happened and he couldn't stop laughing at me. He told me he would get my brother back. So when we were on our way back to the truck my brother was behind my dad and my dad roosted him with sand so bad it made his goggles fall off! My parents and I couldn't stop laughing and we ended up pulling over so we could stop laughing at my brother. After that my brother doesn't roost me anymore.  It's been a year since we have started riding and still my brother has not yet roosted me. He still tends to show off. This one time my moms friends came out and my brother was trying to be cool and ride really fast from coming out of the dunes and he slid on the concrete and he wrecked in front of us and maybe like seven people, it was hilarious everybody was laughing besides my mom. He looked at his arm and he had road rash all down his arm. Well I guess that's what he gets for trying to show off. It's like every time he tries to show off he wrecks, so why does he keep doing it? I don't know why but maybe he should stop sometime so he doesn't wreck every time we go out there. Just kidding it doesn't bother me when he wrecks because they are usually funny. I thinks that's why we have so much fun out there because of him.",17,20,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12782,21382,8," Have you ever had a friend who when your with them you seem to be able to do nothing but laugh? I have, his name is @PERSON. Together, him and I do nothing but spend countless hours making jokes, smiling, and enjoying ourselves. In any relationship, or friendship, laughter is an important quality. In the next few paragraphs I will explain why laughter is so important, and how it made his and our friendship so strong and compatible. To begin with, @PERSON is my closest friend. We both are very fun and outgoing people. We tend to put tense situations at ease by our sense of humors. This is important because without laughter you don't enjoy things as much. Someone once told me ""for every minute you laugh, it adds a year to your life."" That is important because nobody wants to live a short miserable life. Together we make the @CAPS of the worst situations and move on from them. Laughing is something that no one can live without. It is one of those things can make the biggest change in someones life, whether that be in a good way, or even in a bad way. Laughter in our relationship is like glue. When things between us ever got rough, or just things in general got hard, we made it a point to make a joke out of it and try to forget what was wrong. One of the ways our sense of humor came in handy was when we found out he was getting deployed. If you have never been through that before, let me tell you, it's hard. I remember everything about that day, I was outside fixing our fence when i got a call from @CAPS. When I answered his voice was timid and shaken, I had never heard him sound like that before. He then told me that he was going to come over and that he had something he needed to tell me. At first i wasn't too concerned because he has a tendency to joke around and almost never be serious, this time I was wrong. Within twenty minutes I could hear the roar of his red diesel pulling in our driveway. When he got to the door, instead of just walking in like normal, he knocked. To my surprise, as he peeked his head in, his face was as red as a cherry, eyes swollen and watering, and his voice quivering with sadness. I knew then that this was serious. After a miserable three hours of sobbing and hugs he explained to me that he would be leaving in four days to @LOCATION. Taking all that in at once was hard. I knew he was in the army but I guess I just never thought that day would come. Finally we began talking more and more about it the exact details. We then started to @ORGANIZATION things that he could find there that would remind him of home. This turned into a day of jokes. Our first mission was to find a @CAPS @ORGANIZATION, fail. Our second mission, @CAPS-@CAPS, another fail. And finally our third mission, was to find anything that reminded him of me. We came to the conclusion our @CAPS idea would be @CAPS @CAPS. In return we got in his truck ad drove to @CAPS @CAPS and purchased two high-tech @CAPS cams, and went home to set them up. That in itself was a memory I will never forget.  When the day finally came to an end we realized that yes it would be hard for us, but we would not let that break us down. We then spent the next four days doing things he convinced himself ""he @MONTH never get to do again."" We spent hours playing @CAPS-box, hours playing football in the yard, and even hours playing in a park swinging and sliding. The reality of it is, without laughter and fun, we would have most likely not have been able to deal with it. To this day we still plan a specific time, and ""@CAPS it up"" together.  In conclusion, although things get tough and overbearing, there is always an escape. That escape for me and my @CAPS friend is laughter. When worse comes to worst, turn your favorite cartoon on, call the person who can always make you laugh, spend hours doing pointless, yet fun things, enjoy what you have at your fingertips, and laugh, you @MONTH never know when those things can up and walk away.",22,20,0.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0
12783,21383,8,"Many things are said to bring people together. These things can vary from favorite foods to fashion taste or even disliking the same people, but nothing can bring two people as close as a good laugh can. Laughing will always lighten the mood, bring out a winning smile and from time to time, a tear to the eye. Laughing makes the bad days manageable and the great days fantastic. In my perspective, the world wouldn't go around without a good laugh every now and then. By 'good laugh', I @CAPS't mean the kind that makes you happy for a moment, I mean the kind that brings tears to your eyes and creates a shaking feeling in your stomach. The kind of laugh that you remember. I've had many of those moments, but one that I cherish most just happened to occur during a school day. A couple weeks ago I was having a pretty nice day, sure its @CAPS so the weather dampened my spirits a little, but I was doing alright. I had my normal classes, got my average homework load, and then it came time for @CAPS. @CAPS is basically study hall at my school. I sit at a round table in there with a few of my friends and we talk about nearly everything. Everyday, I sit by @PERSON. @PERSON and I occasionally sit and talk with everyone else, but we tend to disingage ourselfs from the others and lock ourselves in our own private world of inside jokes, smart ass laughs and people watching. So that day during @CAPS, I can't quite recall what we were talking about at our table, we all just couldn't keep ourselfs from laughing. Most of the laughing was just giggles, and some of it was straight up, hardcore red faced laughing. After we all settled down from the most recent up roar of chuckling, @PERSON started talking. She somehow spit out the words, ""@CAPS it you guys! You're making my eyes hurt!"" amoungst the giggles still blossoming out of her mouth. After she said that, I became puzzled.I just stared at her and stuttered, ""...what?"". I was sure she made a mistake and said eyes instead of stomach, but after she replied with ""@CAPS't your eyes hurt when you laugh really hard?!"" I lost control. I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe and I felt like I was going to pee! See, the funny part is, @PERSON is @CAPS. So the idea of her eyes hurting from laughing really hard is just uncontrollably funny. After @PERSON and I caught our breath, we asked other @CAPS around the room if their eyes hurt when they laugh and guess what? They @CAPS! This only made us laugh harder. This occasion instantly became another inside joke we treasure.That inside joke is by far one of the funniest ones, and it being funny, just makes it funnier! Everytime she laughs I ask, ""@CAPS your eyes hurt?"" and we just burst into more laughter. The idea of the joke alone brings a smile to my face, that being the reason why laughing is such a big part in our world. It brings happiness, joy and love. Well, actually it brings just about every possitive emotion. I @MONTH not be a doctor yet, but I know I'm right when I say; everyone should get their daily dose of laughter. Laughter can cure just about anything. ",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12784,21384,8," It was the @DATE and my friend @PERSON was going to come home with @CAPS. We talked about our plans for the week all @DATE at @DATE. Some of our ideas that we had thought up included going to a movie, hanging out at my house and doing our nails while telling stories, or going on an adventure around my neighborhood. At lunch that @DATE we decided on trying to do all of the ideas because we had @DATE days to hang out. After lunch we went to our next two classes and the classes seemed to go by really slow. Finally the @DATE bell of the @DATE rang and @PERSON and I ran to our locker to meet up and get all of our stuff to go home.  We went outside the front doors of the @DATE and waited on the front steps for my mom. We waited for twenty minutes @DATE we remembered that my mom told @CAPS that we would have to walk home after @DATE because she had to work late. @PERSON and I looked over at each other and started laughing, because we had totally forgotten about having to walk home. Finally we stopped laughing and got up to walk home. On our way home we had my i-pod out and the volume turned to max so we could listen to music and dance around. We finally made it home and dropped all of our stuff off and got something to drink.  On our way to my moms work, we stopped at the local gas station to get something to eat . We left the gas station and continued to my moms work. On the way to the bank where my mom works we came across a dog chasing a squirrel. The dog was running so fast that the fur on its face was pushed back and it looked like it was going to rip off. The squirrel ran up a tree that was nearby, but the dog didn't realize that he couldn't climb the trunk and ended up running head first into the tree. @PERSON and I started laughing at the dog because it stumbled around for a few minutes and then decided to sit down and just bark at he tree. We left the dog and squirrel and continued to the bank. We arrived at the bank twenty minutes later and talked to my mom. She gave us money to go buy a coffee and then she told us to go back home. On our way home we stopped at @ORGANIZATION and got coffee.   On our way back to my house from @ORGANIZATION we watched the people drive by and laughed at all the people singing in their cars while stopped at the light. We arrived back at my house and decided to put a movie in. We watched @CAPS @CAPS and ate popcorn. Any time the little yellow people came into the movie we laughed because we both thought they were cute. After the movie my parents got home, and we had pizza and @CAPS. Pepper for dinner. After dinner we played the wii and then fell asleep. The next @DATE when we woke up my dad made us pancakes and eggs for breakfast. After breakfast we got ready to go and my mom took us to the mall. At the mall my mom told @PERSON and I to meet her back at food court around two. We left my mom and headed to the first store. While we were walking to one of the store we saw a guy with a mowhak and a green beard. We looked at each other and started laughing because his beard looked like a @CAPS tree tipped over. At @NUM-o'clock we left to go back to food court to meet up with my mom. She bought us @ORGANIZATION and told us that if we left now we could go see a movie. We decided to stay for one more hour and then we left to go home. On our way home we danced around in the backseat and sang to all of the songs that we knew.  When we arrived home we played the wii until my dad got there. After my dad got home we ate dinner and then played the wii again. This time when we played the wii we got my parents to play too. Whenever it was my moms turn we would laugh because of how she would set herself up to bowl. After we finished playing the wii @PERSON and I went into my room and talked about all of the guys that we liked. We laughed at some of our choices because of the reasons that we liked them. We talked for about two hours and then fell asleep. The next @DATE we woke up and had eggs and toast for breakfast. After breakfast @PERSON got dressed to go home. After she left we talked over text about all the fun we had, and how we couldn't wait for tomorrow.",19,20,38.0,38,0.0,0.0,0.0,38.0
12785,21385,8," All of the memories that I've shared with my friends over the years are marked by the expression of an emotion. Usually they include an abundance of laughter and happiness, just enjoying life and being teenagers. But on the other hand, sometimes these memories are tinged with sadness: day-to-day frustrations, vital playoff games that we've lost by small margins, or the passing of important people in our lives. I think that these highs and lows are remembered most in our minds because they are accompanied by things that are auditory (laughing and crying) and our brains recognize them as being more important than a typical day. As children we're very impressionable, so if something makes us extremely happy or unusually sad, it's going to have an effect on us and be remembered.  I think it's known by everyone that teenagers aren't necessarily the most logical thinkers. Some people speculate that it is genetically programmed into our unborn brains that when we reach our teen years we will make a few silly decisions and possibly get into a small amount of trouble. I'll speak for my generation when I say that our actions aren't always completely thought out and sometimes we simply don't have a reason to explain the strange things that we do. For instance, my friend @PERSON has a peculiar and almost obsessive need to keep her car clean at all times. She washes it on multiple occasions throughout the month, and is convinced that driving slower helps to keep the dirt and debris from her mile-long gravel drive away from the candy-apple red paint on her @ORGANIZATION. This wouldn't bother me, except that every day after school I go to her house along with our other friends, @CAPS and @PERSON, to kill time before practice. The group is always anxious to get away from school because we're tired, hungry, and just want to get to her house and relax, but @PERSON never gives in to our persistent begging and is perfectly content to drive at turtle speed. One day, @PERSON became fed up and said that she could probably run faster than @PERSON was driving. @PERSON decided to take her up on the offer, stopped her car, and @PERSON proceeded to get out and jog down the driveway alongside the car. Soon she was a good distance ahead of us, dancing and skipping toward our destination. However, she soon changed her mind and since the car was going slow enough, she climbed on the hood and we continued driving, slowly. We were about two hundred feet from @LOCATION's house, just one small bend before we'd be there, when @PERSON realized that if her grandparents, who live right next door, saw us, then she'd be in trouble. She didn't care to enlighten the rest of us with the details of her mental observation and suddenly stopped in the middle of the driveway. @PERSON slid off the hood, granted we were only going about eight miles an hour, and momentum pushed her forward at a trot. She slid on the gravel road, landed on her rear, skipped across the ground, and then stopped.  Those of us who had remained in the car were in shock, our mouths agape, and we stared at her for the few seconds she remained sitting. She then stood up, turned to face us, and burst into hysteric laughter. We all let out a collective sigh and burst into hysterics as well, remaining in the same spot for a good five minutes. All of us were near tears and out of breath from laughing about the sight, we laughed randomly together throughout the rest of the day, and told all of our other friends about it.  We had realized that it was a stupid thing to do, and @PERSON could have been hurt. But she wasn't, and so we all shared in the camaraderie of the moment. Laughter has that ability to connect people. It takes effort to make someone laugh, to spark the emotional trigger inside them that tells their brain, ""@CAPS, I'm having fun."" @CAPS crying is a sign of extreme sadness, laughter is a sign of joy and elation, an indication of happiness. It shows that you're enjoying what you're doing and want those around you to recognize it. I really enjoy my memories that involve laughter, and when I think of those memories I always laugh again. I think that laughter is one of the rare simple joys in life. You don't have to spend money or drive somewhere, there's virtually no expense. It's timeless, simple, fun.",25,25,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0
12786,21386,8," During the @DATE of the sixth grade @CAPS parents decided they were getting a divorce. I got the phone call when I was at @CAPS best friend @PERSON's house.   ""@CAPS, @CAPS @CAPS father"" @CAPS @CAPS said through the phone to me.   ""@CAPS @CAPS, @CAPS's @CAPS?"" I asked him.   ""@CAPS need to come home, @CAPS @CAPS has served me today with divorce papers."" @CAPS told me. I could feel the tears starting to swell @CAPS in @CAPS eyes. I had no clue @CAPS was happening, I was only @NUM and vaguely knew @CAPS divorce was. Without saying a word to him, I hung @CAPS the phone and ran into @PERSON's room. I knew that the divorce would change things for me, but I didn't realize to @CAPS extent.   I stayed at @LOCATION's house for the next two weeks. There was no way I was going home. I didn't want to see @CAPS @CAPS or @CAPS father. At night I drempt about @CAPS @CAPS sisters were going through, the horror that they had to endure while I was away. I wondered @CAPS @CAPS father was doing, where @CAPS @CAPS was, and whether or not @CAPS sisters were @CAPS. Even though I knew I should have gone home at one point during those two weeks, I didn't.  During those two weeks at @LOCATION's house, I felt safe and secure, but not once did I feel happy. It was an emotion that I had longed for, but all the times that I tried to smile, tried to laugh, tried to be myself, I couldn't. I knew that something had changed in me when I hung @CAPS the phone on @CAPS father. I had never hung @CAPS on anyone before. It was something that I knew I shouldn't have done, but I was so upset, I did it anyways.  When @CAPS @CAPS came to pick me @CAPS after @CAPS two week extended stay at @LOCATION's, she looked at me with concern in her eyes. I had never seen this emotion in @CAPS @CAPS before. She usually was so calm and in control. I had never seen her so concerned or upset. I knew that she was concerned for me. I also knew that @PERSON's @CAPS had called mine several times during @CAPS stay. I assume she told her about how I was acting, but @CAPS was I supposed to do? @CAPS parents were splitting @CAPS! @CAPS whole life was being flushed down the toilet. I knew that nothing would ever be the same and it killed me inside.  No one spoke on the ride home. I could feel the tension building as we turned onto @CAPS street and drove towards @CAPS house. When we pulled into the driveway, I got out of the car and ran to @CAPS room, leaving @CAPS things on the back seat of the sedan. For two days, I didn't eat or sleep. I just laid in @CAPS bed longing for @CAPS father to come home. I had never gone to bed without @CAPS father tucking me in, never woke @CAPS in the @TIME on @CAPS own. There were so many things that @CAPS father did that @CAPS wasn't there to do anymore.  Things didn't start to get better until @CAPS @CAPS sent me and @CAPS sisters to @CAPS @CAPS house in @LOCATION. I don't know why, but when I was there, I felt that same sense of safeness and security that I felt when I was at @LOCATION's house. Even though I felt safe and secure, it still wasn't the same. It had been several weeks since I had visited @PERSON, and I was dying to go back to her house. I knew that that was the only place that I could actually recover from @CAPS was happening. @CAPS @CAPS house was nice and all, but it didn't feel like home, I didn't think that anywhere I stayed would feel right. All I knew is that I needed @CAPS @CAPS, not @CAPS @CAPS or @CAPS @CAPS, just @CAPS @CAPS, and maybe @PERSON.  When I came home from @CAPS @CAPS house, I made arrangements to go over to @LOCATION house. I knew that I would be staying awhile, so I packed extra. When I got there, I told her about @CAPS was going on and how @CAPS sisters were doing. On the night that I arrived, we decided that we would go to the river the next day. I thought it was an alright idea. The next day we went to the river, her brothers decided to join us. Her brother @PERSON wanted to prove to us how much of a man @CAPS was, so @CAPS jumped off of the largest rock at the river. I thought it would be a perfect cannon ball, but it wasn't. @CAPS landed on his stomach for the perfect belly flop. I couldn't contain myself, I burst out laughing, I don't think i stopped laughing for several minutes. It was by far the best day I had since the day @CAPS father called me at @LOCATION's house.",21,19,42.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0
12787,21387,8," @CAPS you laughed today? Many believe that laughing is beneficial in our everyday lives. @CAPS you heard the saying ""laughter is the best medicine."" @CAPS comes from the idea that having a positive mood will make you feel better. Close to the idea of @CAPS. Laughing has been said to relieve stress and makes you seem more approachable to someone you @MONTH not know yet. The quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" is accurate in my opinion. I relate @CAPS to the way my friends and I act and the way I act towards strangers. When meeting someone new making a joke or laughing kind of breaks the ice, and can make the conversation more lighthearted and easy. When I was younger my best friends name was @PERSON, and we hung out nearly everyday after school. We shared everything we had the same favorite color same hair we even had the same friends. We were girls that everyone though were sister because we hung out so much. We were the kind of friends who could take one look at each other and start laughing thinking about a past memory we had. Like the time we went into the wrong movie or the time we went out to lunch together. I remember going to lunch like @CAPS was just the other day though @CAPS was easily years ago. One day we went to our daily kindergarten class together just like always except today @PERSON was going to get to come home with me and my @CAPS. My @CAPS knew she was going to need to take the car into the shop that day and told us we could tag along and if we were good we would go out to lunch. All day we were on our best behavior because we wanted to go to lunch and then hang out for the rest of the day. @CAPS was around lunch time and my @CAPS thought, well the car will be a while so I'll take the girls to lunch and then we will pick @CAPS up on the way home. So we dropped the car off and headed to @ORGANIZATION's (a local @CAPS restaurant) for a @CAPS lunch.  When we got to the restaurant they took our drink orders and I decided @CAPS would be a good idea to get a big blackberry slushy type drink. When @CAPS came to our table I was really excited and I started to drink @CAPS really fast. maybe a little too fast. When all of the sudden ""whoosh"" @CAPS had spilled all over my face and clothes, @CAPS was everywhere, in my hair, on my face, in my eyes. I was so embarrassed. I was so surprised at how hast the the ice fell on my face that I started crying right in front of my best friend. She was trying so hard not to laugh, she had the biggest smile on her face. When I looked over my @CAPS was laughing too I was humiliated. I was so worried my friend and my @CAPS would make fun of me being so clumsy, but they both said that @CAPS has happened to them too.  After I got cleaned up I realized how silly I had been. I was so embarrassed at the time and at them laughing at me. But when I thought about @CAPS I would @CAPS laughed too. The whole car ride home we giggled about my little drink disaster and we could hardly look at each other without saying something about my spill, or we would both think about @CAPS and start cracking up again.   Even though at first I though she would make fun of me and laugh at me for making such a silly accident, we ended up laughing together and @CAPS made us closer as friends. Our memories from when we were little girls last in our minds and we remember they silly and creative things we used to do and the little things that would be fun to us. We were and always will be great friends. We are still best friends and every once in a while one of us will bring something up that makes us think of that day when we were little girls and we will bust out laughing again.  I do believe laughter is the best medicine. Although of course laughter will never conquer or cure diseases or fight off cancers I think @CAPS makes you stronger to take the treatment if you are happy and @CAPS a positive outlook, if you @CAPS something to look forward too, something you don't want to miss. Laughter can make a sick person forget about their illness, @CAPS can make them carefree and living in the moment. I think laughter is so much more powerful than we realize. So consider this question instead: @CAPS you made someone laugh today?",18,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12788,21388,8,"        Family trip @CAPS the @DATE my family and I decided to have a trip to @LOCATION. My father, who had recently woken up from a comma, was in a state of depression. The doctor recommended that my mother should start planning family activities and do some over the @DATE break. I was twelve at the time, and noticed how my father was coping with the fact that he had both of lost his arms. He tried to hide the fact that it was too much for him to handle, but that only worried us more about his health. My mother, along with my sister @CAPS and I decided to go out on a trip -to distract my father- and hopefully get him out of his depression.  On the day of the trip we headed out at about @NUM am from the apartments. My mother was the type of person who would always be early for anything. Overnight we had packed our bags and already had the stuff in the car. Since we lived in the upper apartments, my mother and I helped my father -since there was no way for him to keep himself balanced- while going down the stairs. He didn't seem enthusiastic about the whole trip, but I made sure to get my sisters excited and they kept on talking with my father in the car. A few hours later, one by one my sisters started falling asleep then my father started sleeping. My mother was starting to get drowsy so I stayed up and started talking to her about random subjects. As I kept her company she began telling me stories about her childhood - the laughs she would get when her cousins pranked one another- and so on. Some of the stories were so funny we tried not to wake everyone up with our laughter. Even though she had lived a rough childhood, her cousin @PERSON was the one that had always known how to make her laugh.  My father and sisters woke up and started to get carsick, so my mother ended up exiting towards @LOCATION, @LOCATION. As we began to look for a gas station we began to hear loud music, and as we got closer we noticed that there was a carnival in the middle of the city. My sister @CAPS who was @NUM-years-old at the time began complaining along with @PERSON who was eight-years-old. I tried to convince my parents, and my mother agreed but my father only got mad. That was until my sister @CAPS who was @NUM-years-old began on ranting on and on, until my father finally agreed.  My mother parked the car at the nearby park and my sisters ran ahead of us to the carnival. My mother tried to catch up with them while I locked the car from the inside. As we arrived to the carnival, we saw stands filled with jewelry, clothing, and other small items. We kept on walking and saw a group of gypsies dancing on stage. Later on a comedian went up and he made everyone laugh in the audience. After watching the gypsies and the comedian, we started to look around. We ended up buying three @CAPS parasols and the fourth parasol was free. We thanked the saleswoman as we opened our parasols for some shade. The @DATE heat was starting to get worse, so we headed towards the car.  As we reached the car, my mother's face turned pale, she had left the car keys inside. She began arguing with me, and I began regretting the whole trip. I was exhausted and didn't want to argue. My father finally interrupted by telling us that he was going to search for a wire hanger from one of the stands in the carnival. As he left with my sister @PERSON, the rest of us began walking towards the park. @CAPS began pouting and my mother kept on blaming me for locking the car, meanwhile I pretended I was deaf. After my father came back with a wire hanger, I began straightening it out and bending one side to create a hook. After many tries I still couldn't open the car, and my arms began to hurt. An old couple riding on a motorcycle parked next to us and asked us what we were doing. My father told them we had left the keys inside car. The old man helped us open one of the car doors. We thanked him and said goodbye as we went inside the car.  We decided to head home, exhausted from the whole trip. Even though the destination had changed we enjoyed the trip, and everyone quickly forgot about the incident with the keys. My mother and sisters started joking around, and for the first time since coming out of the hospital my father began laughing.",20,18,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

12790,21390,8," I think laughter is good for a relationships and here is why . When I first got to @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS i was trying to be myself and make friends. One day I was in class and @CAPS came into my class room and came up to me and she started talking to me and I started laughing .The she told me that she liked my laugh so she stared laughing like me. So that I would laugh more an @CAPS felt good knowing that she was making fun of my laugh she was enjoying @CAPS . She was trying to get me to laugh cause she thought @CAPS was funny because she had never heard anyone laugh like that. Everyone has a different laugh i have two laughs which she found out funny . @CAPS was the best day of my life because i was being myself and I know she wasn't laughing at me. Every time she hears me laugh she laughs and tries to make me laugh so that she can laugh and we all have a good time. For me @CAPS is funny because lot's of people don't notice how other people laugh.  @CAPS feel good that she noticed and liked @CAPS and wanted to have a good time. Most people when they make fun of someone they say hurtful things @CAPS wanted to make me laugh again i know she wasn't making fun of me. She just thought @CAPS was unique and funny but not a haha you are weird funny but like a omg i love your laugh, its cute and funny. Now every time she sees me she tries to make me laugh @CAPS makes me feel good every time she does @CAPS.When you are new at @CAPS good to make other people laugh specially when its not at you directly. To be honest @CAPS made me feel like people were startling to like me and not knowing me as ""the new kid"" but as a human being an actual person and that they say me for me not for what i wanna be or for what people see me as. That's all i could really ask for. So my opinion is yes laughter is good for relationships @CAPS shows that you have a sense of humor and that there is a actual person inside that body not just bones.  Another reason is @CAPS shows your personalty your real self. Isn't that what people, to want people to see them for who they are not what people say there are.At least that's what i want. that's why i will never forget that class period. @CAPS showed me that if i just laugh with other people ill know that the aren't laughing at me like making fun of me they are saying that i am funny. That's what people want is to see people for who they are.  The teacher was a substitute for that day and she kept on getting mad at us for laughing but we couldn't help @CAPS because @CAPS was so funny. That period i laughed the whole time. I was laughing so @CAPS that i peed my pants a little. She made fish faces and sounds like she pretended to be a monkey in a tree. She laughed how I laugh she did everything to make me laugh. @CAPS was so funny @CAPS took up the whole period. That's is how much i was laughing.  I got up and was going to go to the bathroom and when i got back she was still there and i sat down and so she started making me laugh. So then i sat down and @CAPS and @PERSON came in and there was something in his pocket and i poked at @CAPS and said what is that its @CAPS. We all started laughing cause @CAPS was funny @CAPS was is wallet. I didn't get why they were still laughing when I stopped but then I continued to still laugh because the way they were laughing. We all were laughing and then we all stopped at the same time and because we all stopped at the same time we all started laughing cause @CAPS was funny.The sub came and stood there by us and we all got quit and then started laughing again. I think that the reason why we were laughing was because we were doing dumb stuff. I turned around to do my work and then @CAPS spinned me around so that i would start laughing again. Then i started laughing again @CAPS I started crying. I was laughing so @CAPS. @CAPS started laughing so @CAPS that she started laughing. At the end of the period I had to pee so bad. @CAPS wouldn't let me go she just kept on making me laugh more and more. Sometimes just laughing for no reason is the most fun. I guss my whole belief is that laughter is one of the best things that a person can do. Not only is @CAPS fun but @CAPS is also a very healthy thing to do.",20,16,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12791,21391,8," I have been waiting a whole year for @TIME day to come, @DATE. Today is my birthday! I just cant wait to open presents and eat cake. I am turning @NUM and all my friends are coming over and everything. It should be a great day! First I have to wait for my mom to @CAPS home from work. So today I am going to go swimming then going to go on a hike then finally my friends can come over and the party we start. We will have games, presents and cake. My mom said my sister were automatically invited but I dont like that rule. Maybe next birthday @CAPS can uninvited them.  My mom is at work. She left at @TIME and me and my sister just ate breakfast now we are going to go swimming. We have a pool right beside the patio in the front yard. Sometimes when my sister is mad she just throws me in. Other times she just does it because she is bigger then me and she can. My older sister @PERSON friend @PERSON was spending the week with us because she had moved away over the @DATE and decided she would come visit. Thats when they decided to start throwing me in the pool. One would always grab my legs the other would grab my arms and they would swing me until they just t threw me in the pool. well I got mad after it kept happening and threw a fit and cried. @PERSON told me if i was going to acting like a baby then i deserved to be treated like one, so she put me in a diaper and in the highchair and forced me to eat baby food. Of course I was crying now because I do not like baby food and to be in a highchair or be put in a diaper.  By @TIME time i didnt want to go on a hike and was just wanting my mom to be home. Finally my mom was home and even better she brought pizza. I was so excited that she did because all my friends were coming over and pizza was perfect.My mom change out of her work clothes then she decided it was time for me to take a nap. well I am @NUM i dont need a nap so thats when knew something was up. now that I decided it was @CAPS I went and took a nap and actually really did fall asleep. my mom at @TIME time cleaned, decorated and went and got all my friends. when i woke up and walked out of the living room mom and all my friends screamed ""surprise"" and I was definitely surprised. After a long fun party it was time that we cleaned up and put all the garbage away and the cake in the over so no flies would @CAPS to it. The next day my mom went back to work and I swam and played all day! It was a great day got to wear my new swim suit and got to also play with my new floaty toys I got. I got a lot of @DATE stuff. then, me and my little sister @PERSON were trying to find a way to @CAPS hot water into the pool but we were having trouble because the house didnt fit to the faucet at the bathroom. so thats when we went to my moms room and used the bathtub and put the hose all the way out the back door. We definitely accomplished that mission! By @TIME time we heard a lot of craziness and I went to go see what was going on and it was smoky all over. I went into the kitchen and my sister yelled"" @CAPS your sisters and @CAPS out of the house meet you at the road"" I ran and got them and then i saw fire trucks speeding up the drive way and here comes my mom racing over and she was freaking out making sure everyone was @CAPS.  In the end I found out that she had burn my birthday cake trying to preheat the over for pizza. I was kinda upset that it was burnt but now I am @CAPS with it because I look back and laugh because my sister to @TIME day still has the burnt spoon and the lock. the lock is from our gate it was a simple dummy lock and the fire fighters didnt know so they just cut the chains. I guess the lesson learned here is that before you preheat the over you should always make sure nothing is in there.",16,18,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0

Me and my best friend are complete opposite yet we became best @CAPS over a simple joke in the locker room. It happened on a @TIME that was not going to great for me, or her. It was @DATE @TIME I had to go to school. I had woken up late just the missed, walked all the way to school and had already dropped my lunch in the hallway about three times when, I walked straight into @PERSON. (my soon to be best friend) ""@CAPS where your going."" she said to me in a catty voice and stuck me with a pointed glare. Me being shy, i just ducked my head and kept walking. @PERSON was one of the prettiest girls in school and hung out with the "" In "" clique I, well I didn't. Most of the time I hung out by my self.  Her @TIME had been going just about as well as mine was. Her @CAPS had broken up with her ,for her best friend, at the time,she also had stayed the night in the hospital with her brother who had been in a car accident. So she was in the same mood I was.What was even worse was our next class was @CAPS.E.! I got into the locker room and as soon as I walked in I realized I had forgotten my gym clothes. @PERSON had just entered behind me and by the sigh she let out I knew she had forgotten hers to . We were going to have to use some from the bucket...  The bucket was where all lost or unwanted items ended up @CAPS there was cool stuff like sweat shirts and @CAPS neat tee shirts but you could never be sure if they were clean. Today though, it looked like there was only guy clothes. I walked over to the bucket and @PERSON came over next to me. We both began to dig through the bucket. Finding nothing but over sized sweat pants and extra large shirts we @CAPS out the ones we thought were the best. We changed and as soon as our eyes met we both started cracking up. We looked like two little kids playing in their dads clothes. She could not let go of her pants or else they would drop around her ankles and the shirt I was wearing hung down past my knees. Neither of us stopped laughing until our sides ached and there were tears running down our faces.  When the @ORGANIZATION teacher banged on the door we walked out of the locker room and the whole gym stared at us but we had found confidence and friendship in each other so, we didn't care. Sense that day @PERSON and I have been glued to each others sides as best @CAPS. We have been through many fights but every time I think about that day in the locker room I can't help but to laugh. That is how laughter brought @PERSON and I to be best @CAPS.",18,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

We headed out from the house at about @NUM o'clock pm. When we left the house we headed for one of our friends house because we asked them earlier if they wanted to go. So when we left we had to leave fast so we were not on the the road for a long time. When we got to our friends house we hung out for a little while then asked them if they still wanted to go on a ride with us. They got all ready then at about @NUM:45 we all headed out.

So we just hung out until @NUM o'clock. When I say hangout I mean we hit some mud holes and played around a little bit. By the time we were all muddy it was about @NUM:55 pm. So we set up some fireworks to shoot off. Then about @TIME we shot all of them off. There was only about @TIME or @NUM of them. We started to head back home at about @NUM in the @TIME but one of our friends got stuck in some snow off the side of the road. We spent about a half hour digging him out before we finally headed back home. We arrived back at the house at @NUM in the @TIME.

12794,21394,8,"  I believe that laughter is a healthy way to get a along with someone, and have fun! I think that the more you laugh the more fun you're having with someone or a group of people. One time me and my friend @PERSON were hanging out at my house and we literally couldn't stop laughing, every little thing was hilarious to us for some reason! It makes us have so much more fun together, when we can just laugh together instead of fighting. I love to laugh; all my friends call me obnoxious because I laugh all the time. I feel like if you're laughing and laughing with someone it makes you closer and it's way more healthier and better if you just laugh! For example I always want to hang out with @PERSON because we always laugh together and have a good time. It's like when you have a group of friends and some of them you always disagree on something or fighting, its never fun. If you have a boyfriend/girlfriend and you always laugh with her/him it just makes you want to be around them so much more, because your having a good time. Fighting just does the opposite!   I've recently realized who my good friends and who are my bad friends. Laughing is the biggest quality to have in someone. The girls I fight with are usually the ones who have no personality and are very negative and are just mad people. My friends that I do get along with we always laugh and have a good time, the only time I've got in a fight with one of my good friends is because the downers always say random stuff that's not true and hurtful so that person will be right there down with you! I have realized the more you laugh the more fun you will have and the more people want to be around you! I've also noticed that my mom and dad are completely different people. My mom is a sweetheart who always laughs and I can always have fun with. My dad on the other hand never laughs. I honestly can not remember the last time I heard him laugh. He is such a downer and no one ever wants to be around him. That's probably why my parents are divorced! You can just tell that my mom has more fun and my dad doesn't. In life you really just have to have fun do what your supposed to do and laugh. So really what I'm trying to say is laughing is a important part of any relationship; whether its with friends family dating, just anything! It's definitely a good quality to have.    If a person is always happy and always wanting to have a good time, I think its how they're raised. If you think about it I get my mom @PERCENT of the time and my dad @PERCENT of the time. Whenever I'm with my dad I'm always in a worse mood, I never want to do what he's asking. I basically want to rebel. When I'm with my mom I literally do the opposite I'm always happier and will do what she wants, and we always laugh and have a way better relationship then me and my dad do. I think laughing and being happier has a lot to do with who you look up to and how they act, and what they do. I can definitely tell my mood change from parent to parent. It has a lot to do with how the parents are raising their kids. I think as a adult you need to be a positive influence on your kid/teenager. I think its good to have a healthy laughing relationship with your kid. Life is to short to spend it hating someone, I believe you should spend your life having a good time and fulfilling your dreams, and mostly laughing. ",16,15,0.0,31,0.0,0.0,0.0,31.0
12795,21397,8," When I was in third grade my parents decided that we should move to where my @CAPS was born and raised and where my @CAPS lived. I, being a determined third grader, was angry and told them that I would not move and even sat on the floor and told them that I was not going. Needless to say I did not get very far, but I was still not happy about being moved from my friends and my @CAPS's side of the family that I had been around since I was little. My friends were all I had known through my years in elementary school and I was no where near ready to say goodbye to them. It was very hard saying goodbye to them even though we came back and visited later on. We moved three hours away from my hometown. It was a pretty big move, especially for a ten year old who had never really been anywhere else.  Being a new student is never easy. Especially with a shy, quiet personality like mine is and the first day was a scary one. I remember it very vividly. I walked in with my @CAPS and my new teacher happened to be in the office at the time, so she took me down to the class and showed me around the school. I was still frightened and was upset that my parents were making me go through this huge change. When class started the teacher made me stand up in front of the class and tell them about myself. I have never been much of a public speaker and it is hard for me to believe that I actually did stand there and talk about myself. I can not even do that very well today, and I am way less shy then I was back then. It was very terrifying to say the least even more so when I was done speaking and the class sat in dead silence. Then I slowly walked to my seat and being the shy person I am, did not talk for the rest of the time until lunch.  At lunch a little girl with freckles and glasses, like myself, came and sat with me. Once she broke down my shy exterior we were laughing, playing and having a real good time. And for the first time that day I thought to myself that moving might turn out to be okay. Me and her became really good friends along with the other girls she hung out with. We sat next to each other in class, talked on the phone, had sleepovers and spent recess together everyday. She was the first best friend I had made when I moved and I was glad it was her and not someone else. Today I am very thankful to her for taking the time to get to know me when I at first was shy and not saying much, because I know how it feels to approach someone you do not know.  The laughter that we shared that first day at lunch and her willingness to break down my walls of shyness really brought us close together. Without her that first day I am unsure how the rest of that day or week would have gone. Without people like her who are willing to make a new friend it would have been a lonely first couple of days for me. Laughter is an important part of a relationship because it brings people closer together and shows that even if you do not know someone very well you still can have a good time. The rest of that day is a better memory because we shared laughter and became friends. It made moving to a new school less scary and helped me to find a place to fit in.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

People often @CAPS them in their homes as a reminder on how one should @CAPS their life. Well, I believe that laughing is one of the most important elements you need, in order to @CAPS your life to the fullest. Laughter keeps the soul young, the heart happy, and the spirit joyful. Without laughter, one @MONTH feel that they @CAPS an emptiness inside that they are unable to fill. Laughter has played a huge role in my life and has created some of the best memories. If luaghter was not a part of me, my life would be like a house without furniture; empty, boring, and over all, pointless. Some memories will never leave my mind, and looking back, I still @CAPS my brains out. My favorite, and most hilarious memory that I can think of, occurred about two years ago at my grandparents house. My family and I were staying with my grandparents for the weekend up at their house in @CAPS, which I absolutely loved because there was so much to do there! They had go-carts, golf carts, acreage, and a gigantic swimming pool! What more could someone want? The weather was always nice and warm as well, so I had no complaints. It was a beautiful evening, my brother, his best friend, and I decided to take the golf carts out for a spin. My brother was in his own golf cart zooming by, and I was in one with his friend @PERSON. Now, @ORGANIZATION must @CAPS seen something in the road because he told me to stop, then he hopped out. As he curiously made his way to the front of the golf cart, I pressed gently on the gas inching forward in a sort of fast manner just to scare him a little. As I did that, he frantically jumped on the hood like a cat that had just been frightened. I then decided to slam on the brakes, and when that happened, @PERSON launched off like a rocket, but then tried to hop back on the hood. I guess you could say we developed a game. I would go a few inches or so, then slam on the brakes! At that point I was practically crying from laughing so hard. That is until something very unexpected happened...I drove fast, and then stopped very quickly, but as i did so, this time @PERSON tripped! I didn't notice because I was carelessly driving like a maniac, but soon enough the golf cart was on top of him! All I remember hearing was a @CAPS @CAPS! and then a loud shrilll. He was laying face first, cart on his back, and I had no idea what to do! My heart quickly sped up, and a gust of fear came over me. I looked to my right to find my brother rolling around on his back laughing like a hyena! I was still sitting in the golf cart, still unable to move in my state of shock. My brother finally got up and @PERSON was yelling, ""@CAPS't move @CAPS!"" @CAPS I had to do something! My brother was trying to tell me that we should lift the heavy cart from his back but in my head, I knew that both of us together wouldn't @CAPS been able to do that. Taking matters into my own hands, I shifted into reverse very carefully and slowly. Biting down on my lower lip, closing my eyes tightly, I pounded the gas to the ground, flying backwards off of his helpless body. Luckily no damage was done, and @ORGANIZATION was perfectly fine. A gigantic weight was lifted from my back and I was able to breathe again. Looking back, I am able to @CAPS and joke about that wonderful day that went so wonderfully wrong, though I am very thankful that nothing extremely harmful happened to the poor guy I dreadfully ran over that day. I can tell you one thing, as the day carried on, we had a blast. Carelessly being the great teenagers we are, and without a worry in the world; we laughed, swam, drove the golf carts, and enjoyed the wind swooping our hair up, then down, then all around. I take back two things from this crazy day. One, make smart decisions, and be prepared for the consequences that you @MONTH be faced with, and two, enjoy your life. @CAPS like there's no tomorrow. Be careless yet careful, and enjoy every second of it! I've learned that when faced with a tough decision; for example...do I roll off of my brothersfriend? or do I continue to sit here and listen to him yell? In that case I took a big leap of faith, and went with my gut instinct. Which I believe was most definitley the right decision.

Everyone was going to @LOCATION for the biggest concert any one has ever been to. Only the students in eighth grade in either band, choir, jazz band, or jazz choir were able to go; if @CAPS didn't pay all your funds, then @CAPS were left behind. We were going to a hotel, attending a concert, and going to a @CAPS @CAPS.   My friends, @PERSON, @PERSON, and @PERSON were without a doubt excited. We have never been on the longest road trip till then. @CAPS seemed to have taken days to get to @LOCATION. We left at five in the morning with over one hundred kids packed into two buses. One bus was for the boys and one for the girls, yet there were more girls then boys so we split the boys bus.   I was stuck sitting with @CAPS. @CAPS is a nice girl, but @CAPS was difficult to start conversations with her. @CAPS wanted to be back home in @LOCATION. I never found out why @CAPS was so upset; which made my ride there unbelievably boring. Until @PERSON's accident. @CAPS snorted a pretzel up her nose. Overall @CAPS was okay and everyone besides @CAPS laughed along with her.   By the third hour of sitting in a cramped bus, us girls had to go to the bathroom. Complaining to the bus driver @CAPS replied, ""We're almost to the pit stop. Just another hour or so."" The choir girls began singing about going to the bathroom. Soon the bus was filled with our melodious song and laughter. Finally @CAPS, the bus driver, pulled over. A line of dancing girls bulged out of the bathroom laughing at each other.   Once we were done we said our farewells to the boys as they piled onto the bus and took off. ""@CAPS down. Lets get to @LOCATION."" @CAPS said. We cheered as we drove off. Four hours later, we were stopped yet again, at another gas station eating our lunch. The boys were fine with how much progress we made; starting calling everyone of us girls the boys were getting annoying. Us girls ignored all calls from boys for the rest of our trip. Finally we got to our hotel.  At the hotel the boys got the top story while the girls got the lower story near the swimming pool. When dinner came along @PERSON, our music director, aloud everyone to roam around the stores near by and buy our dinners. Luckily we were near @ORGANIZATION, @ORGANIZATION, @ORGANIZATION, and a numerous amount of fast food places. @PERSON and I went to @ORGANIZATION while @PERSON and @PERSON got our drinks; since we didn't want @ORGANIZATION drinks they went to @ORGANIZATION to buy @CAPS. We met back at our room with our goods. We gorged ourselves till our abdomens seemed to explode. Dancing her way into the bathroom, @PERSON apeard with a broom as her dancing partner. Our laughter filled the room. We partied on till we realized we had a concert to attend.   We had two hours till the concert and thirty dollars was missing. @PERSON, @PERSON, @PERSON and I searched our room almost missing breakfast and ending up empty handed. When we found the girls across the hall all except one of them were there. The remaining girls looked at each other. "" @CAPS was out of money yesterday and now all of the sudden @CAPS has money to buy food. We're missing fifty dollars."" @CAPS replied. @PERSON then came in, ""@CAPS up. We got a concert to attend."" @CAPS at each other with disapointment we all left.  Running to the back stage door I dropped my music. @PERSON laughed picking @CAPS up. ""@CAPS'll do great."" @CAPS said smiling. I smiled back, ""@CAPS @CAPS."" I turned and stepped out onto the empty stage and took my seat in the front of the band. Picking up my flute I began my solo. The soft chords filled my ears as I imagined myself alone. Although I was nervous my stage fright gracefully vanished.   I ran out the auditorium doors. Girls and boys laughing with me as we raced to the buses. The bus drivers hurried their way to the @CAPS @CAPS. Once we were there, @PERSON payed for everyone and we were off. Laughing at ourselves @PERSON, @PERSON, @PERSON and I screamed at the top of our lungs when the @CAPS shock dropped. When the ride was over, we all laughed seeming to have come @CAPS.  I didn't want to leave, but I knew I had to. Everyone piled back on the bus and called our parents to let them know we were coming home. Laughing at every mistake we made, @PERSON, @PERSON, @PERSON and I took a group picture to remember the trip. Some how amongst the trip we laughed together at everything.

12799,21404,8," Laughter is one of the best things people can learn to do. Laughter is one of the many things I enjoy doing. I love how everyone has their own distinctive laugh, some are loud and some are quiet almost like a giggle. Not only do I enjoy it but I love that is helps me relieve stress, which is a major part of relationships. My boyfriend and I met about three years ago. Today we have been going out for a year and three months. We met whenI was mowing my yard, and my neighbor @LOCATION brought him over to introduce us to each other. I mean she couldn't have brought him over at a worse time; I was hot and sweaty because it was eighty degrees out side, I had no make-up on, and I smelled like fresh cut grass what a great first impression huh? ""@CAPS @CAPS this is @PERSON"" she said with a smile. ""@CAPS timing @CAPS"" I replied with a tone of anger in my voice. ""sorry"" she said, ""but he said he wanted to meet you , and he wouldn't shut up about it."" I looked over at him and noticed that he blushed a little and I laughed. From then on I knew that @PERSON and I were going to have something great together. Till this day our relationship is stronger than ever, and it's because we can make each other laugh. Now don't get me wrong, trust, honesty, communication, listening, are all still a big part and those are important too, but I think that having humor and being able to laugh in a relationship is one of the key things to a healthy and long lasting relationship. My boyfriend and I have great sense of humor, and we defiantly like to use it in our relationship. I could have the worst day of my life;and when I talk to him on the phone I know my day is going to change from horrible to fantastic. Just because I know that within the first few minutes of talking to him and hearing his voice, he's going to say something funny and I can't help but to laugh. I honestly believe you need a good sense of humor in your relationship if you want it to last. When you don't have laughter in your relationship, it tends to get very dull and boring. You can't be serious twenty-four seven, that's way too stressful. Since laughter helps relieve stress, you will defiantly need it during your relationship so it doesn't get stressful and turn into nothing but a bunch of fighting and arguing. So in conclusion, I know your thoughts about what I just talked about might not be the same, but I hope after reading this you will be more willing to consider my opinions on the subject of laughter in a relationship, based on being able to enjoy and know what laughter is, and also how great of a thing it is. How it relieves stress, if you have a bunch of stress in your relationship try cracking a couple jokes you will be amazed at what a little bit of laughing can do. Especially if you want to keep your relationship with your significant other happy, fun, and not only that but also full of life. Laughter is bliss",17,20,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12800,21405,8," I don't think people today laugh enough. Laughing is said to be one of the healthiest things out there. I've heard that the more you laugh, the longer you live. If that's true, I should live forever! I believe laughing really is healthy for you.  I have a friend who's really sick right now, but when I'm with her I can make her laugh like crazy and it seems to make the pain go away. If I could cheer her up @NUM I'd be happy to do so. Yesterday her and I were together and I can't remember what we were talking about but it must of been good because she got me to laugh to hard that I threw up! I know that doesn't sound very fun, but even as I was coming up from doing that we were both still laughing. Times like that I can definitely look back and smile on. I love the effect laughter has on people. I've been sitting down at a bus stop and giggling or laughing for absolutely no reason and the people next to me will start laughing! That only makes me laugh harder then everyone's doing it! Also as long as you're with friends, or anyone for that matter, and you can laugh, that means you're having fun and enjoy each others company. I don't see the point in being friends with someone who can't at least make you giggle a bit.  The other day me and my friend were sitting in the car, it was dark, quiet and we were just talking. Out of no where my mom pops up saying, ""@CAPS!"" (this always happens though.) @CAPS did we scream our lungs out. I guess we should have expected her to do something like that though. After we caught our breath, we both looked at each other only to start laughing hysterically at how silly that was.  Laughter really does bring people together, whether you're strangers or best friends. When you're laughing with someone you're usually laughing for the same reason, right? Just as my friend and I were in the car. That's what I love, because that means we have things in common.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

We all know that most children find absolutely everything funny. @CAPS I was about ten my parents bought my siblings and I a puppy. This was no ordinary puppy, it was the runt of the litter, and it had some kind of mental disorder. Oh, how we loved that puppy. Every day @CAPS I got home from school I would go in the back yard and play with the puppy for hours and hours. We finally found a name for @CAPS a few days later; his name was @CAPS. The reason we named @CAPS @CAPS was because @CAPS would literally tip over while just walking.  One day @CAPS I got home from school I took @CAPS to the top of the hill in our back yard, I was playing with @CAPS and running around and laughing. Every time @CAPS would run down the hill his little legs would get tangled up and @CAPS would nose dive and start tumbling down the hill until @CAPS could get back up again, which normally wasn't until @CAPS was at the bottom of the hill. @CAPS @CAPS did that my sister and I would laugh so hard because it was so cute and we just loved it! As children we lived life for the moment, and enjoyed our lives. I think that we still need to do that now. We need laughter and @CAPS in our lives, we need to focus on the positive and not dwell on the negative. The laughter of your @CAPS should carry on through the rest of your life. @CAPS has blessed us with so much, @CAPS has given us more than we give @CAPS credit for.

12803,21409,8," Growing up with both of my parents and having my dads parents (my grandparents) has been the best thing for me. I spent a ton of time at my grandparents house when I was @CAPS. Every @DATE we got out of @CAPS an hour early. And every @DATE of elementary school, my grandpa would be waiting for me to get out of school. He would pick me up and then we would go to either @ORGANIZATION or @CAPS's for lunch. I always wanted to go to @ORGANIZATION because they had a play structure. But growing up, I became really close with my grandma and grandpa. My parents didn't need to worry about babysitters because we always had my grandparents that would take care of me. So the bond with them just got stronger and stronger. I would always do my homework with my grandma, and then when I was done I would go out with my grandpa and do yard work or tinker on something in the garage. A lot of what I know now was taught to me by my grandparents. I was a very lucky @CAPS @CAPS to grow up having them in my life. Doing yard work with my @CAPS (which is what I called my grandpa when I was @CAPS) was actually fun. I loved yard work. He taught me how to use the riding lawn mower at a very young age. So by the time i was @NUM years old I could start it up, mow the lawn, empty the grass from the catcher, and put the mower back in the garage when I was done without any help. Well one sunny @DATE day, when I finished mowing the lawn my grandpa was sitting on the patio drinking @NUM, like always. So I grabbed myself one and went and joined him because that is where he always sat and watched me mow the lawn and that's where we always hung out together. We're sitting there just talking, and he asks me if I hooked the hose back up to the fosit. Well of course I didn't because I wanted to go sit on the patio with my @CAPS. So him and I walked over to the fosit to hook it back up. But for whatever reason he told me to take the nozzle end out to some flowers. Now here is a @NUM year old kid standing behind his @CAPS with the nozzle end of a hose with @CAPS bending over in front of me. So I did what any other @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS would do. I held the nozzle up, aimed right at that big booty of his, and pulled the trigger. After about a good @NUM second soaking of his bum, I dropped the nozzle and ran as fast as I could to my grandma. And when I got to her she was wondering why I was so scared. Well all I would say was, ""@CAPS is gonna kill me!"". Here comes @CAPS walking up the front door which just happened to be where grandma and I were standing. He had just the most straight angry look on this face. I literally thought that my butt was going to hurt forever after he spanked me. And so there the @NUM of us were standing there. Me thinking that I'm going to die. And all of the sudden my grandpa gets the biggest smile on his face and both him and my grandma start cracking up. He wasn't mad, he thought it was hilarious! So of course I start laughing too!  @CAPS came inside and changed his now water soaked pants and underwear and then all @NUM of us went out on the patio and just chilled and talked and drank some great @NUM. After a couple hours of relaxing with the best grandparents in the world, my grandma went inside to make dinner. So @CAPS and I stayed out on the patio and shot pine cones out of the tree with a @CAPS gun, seeing who could shoot more down before dinner was ready. Grandma called us in for dinner. And that night was one of the best dinners that I ever had with my grandparents, because all we did was eat, and laugh, and eat, and laugh, and eat a @CAPS more, and laugh a @CAPS more! Well @CAPS and I had a tradition that was started when I was old enough to talk, drink root beer floats and watch @CAPS's together. And from that night on to the day he died, my best friend was my @CAPS. He passed away about a year ago. Life hasn't been the same since then. But when he passed he left me his truck. Every morning when I get in and start it up, the sound of the engine just brings back memories of him and I. The sound of the blinker even brings some memories too.  But I know that everyday he looks down on me and thinks back to all of the good times that we had. Ah, how I miss the good times.",22,22,0.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.0,44.0
12804,21410,8," When people think of football they think of the quarter back. When people think of basketball they think of the point guard. When people think of soccer they think of the goalie. Well when people think of softball they think of the pitcher. All these sports have one position where they are automatically put in a leader position. In softball the game always starts with the pitcher and usually ends with the pitcher. The pitcher is in every single play. Sometimes the pitcher pitches it and the big @NUM inch softball comes darting back at you before you even blink your eye and then the ball that you just threw underhand you now have to throw overhand to any of the four bases in a matter of seconds. To play a major position on a team and be a successful leader you need to be encouraging, helpful, and most importantly when the game is not going the way you want it to go, be able to stay calm and laugh and joke about the situation.I have been pitching fast pitch softball for ten years, and the compliment I get the most often is ""you have the best pitcher's mentality I have ever seen"". It is so stressful to be in a really competitive game and have the whole game on your shoulders. Three people on base, one bad pitch right down the middle and it is over the fence. One pitch can completely change the game! At times like these when the pitch just didn't go the way it was supposed to go and your whole time just looks at you with this gloomy expression on their face. As the leader on the team you can't just act defeated as you feel. I have observed numerous pitchers who just completely give up and look defeated. By being a leader, the other athletes look to you to see your reaction. If you look like you have no hope, then players assume that the game is over and the very next play they will mess up and so on and it will just get worse. By smiling and encouraging your teammates, they see that the leader hasn't given up and neither should they, this is always better in the long run. Players tend to look at who as the most authority on the field and respond the exact same way as they do.I play for a team that most of the players this is their second to third year. We are not a very good team but we practice hard and we never give up, it doesn't matter what the score is. In our league out of the seven other teams four are in the top ten in the entire state. One team in particular is @LOCATION, they were first in state last year and were are very first game last year. By the third inning we were losing @NUM. Even though I knew there was no possible way we were going to catch up, my goal was not to let them score again. In between innings I talked to every single player on my team, I tried cheesy jokes, inside jokes, anything to get rid of the tension. It worked and we played much better by having fun and being relaxed. Being in stressful situations people just have to find a way to laugh it off and see the bright side of any predicament and be able to get through it.",18,15,0.0,33,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.0
12805,21411,8,"We all need laughter once in our life!, but why do we need it? or why is it important to us?. We need laughter to have a great time with our friends and family because with out laughter our life's would be black and white we would be empty from inside with no spark of happiness and we would be grumpy all the time. Laughter is also important to us because that also gets us as people be in a relationship with someone we really like it maybe a female or a male it's also important that in the relationship you also have a great time when you are with that special person and not be bored and talk about things that really don't matter when you are with that person. Its fun when you make someone laugh because that shows that @CAPS are having a great time with you and might want to hang out some other day again and that's why we need laughter in a relationship or in friendships. Once I use to live in @LOCATION till my parents decided to move to @PERSON.@CAPS my parents told me I was going to go to @LOCATION I knew a few people from this @LOCATION.The people I knew were @NUM,and @PERSON but I didnt really talk with @LOCATION or @CAPS before I only talked with @PERSON. On my first day of @LOCATION he presented @CAPS friends to me because I didn't really know anybody else besides them three he would make up any kind of jokes and would involve me in it so I would be able to meet this friends better and maybe be friends with them but laughter always make friends and boy friends because I started dating when I was in middle @LOCATION I dated three guys my third boyfriend was the best he was sweet and nice he would do @CAPS ever just to make me laugh we only dated for @NUM years but @CAPS there was too much drama that I broke up with him it was really hard because I really liked him but we would still talk and make fun of each other he would still be nice to me even if we were not together like he wanted and me to but just because of the drama we had we broke up.always laugh dont get down just because of a relationship smile and laugh.After a year with out dating he decided to ask me if I wanted to be @CAPS girlfriend again and I thought about it a lot because I didn't want to go through the same drama as before.While we were not dating he would always find away to make me laugh or smile. when he sees me down @CAPS always there for me to support me and make me laugh that's @CAPS I like about him that @CAPS sweet and nice but if he only didn't believe @CAPS @CAPS friends tell him we would still be together and we would be laughing at everything together. We would make fun of each other we would never stop laughing it was some great times when I was with him but he still try's to keep a smile on my face even if I'm mad sad or not in the mood of doing something that's why we need laughter in our life's because it brings joy to does people that love us and care for us and by us having a smile in our face @CAPS are happy. Always make a relationship good by having a good time and making each other laugh one way or another it doesn't matter of @CAPS you laugh the thing is that you have fun.  Another way to have fun and enjoy your relationship and friends at the same time is to have a time and maybe go to the movies with all your friends and boyfriend and go watch a movie or go to the fair were ever you think you want to go but also think about your friends and boyfriend if @CAPS are going to have fun there or if @CAPS will get bored. When you go with them make sure you make them laugh at least so @CAPS know that you are having fun make up a joke but don't say a joke that will make them fall asleep like my little sister @CAPS told us a joke it goes like this (guy on the @NUM I speak to your dad?"" the little boy whisper and said ""@CAPS busy!"",""@CAPS about your mom?"" said the man on the phone, @CAPS the kid said ""@CAPS is busy too!"" @CAPS the man asked him ""@CAPS @CAPS are @CAPS doing?"" and the boy says""@CAPS are looking for me!"" we didn't get it at first @CAPS my sister told us that the boy was hiding from @CAPS parents because he took the phone with him as in the boy don't tell jokes like does make it more funner. and thats why we need laughter in our life's.

12807,21413,8," Laughter is the only characteristic a person could perfect. Laughter is the element that could bring a group of people into a tight bond of friends. Laughter is the ultimate answer to success and happiness in life, and this is what the story of mine demanded me to say about laughter. Many times my family of four departs to go camping during the @DATE. Family friends enjoy coming along with us on these vacations. A couple summers ago while on a camping trip with my family and lots of friends, I experienced and learned what true, rich laughter could do that changed my life. Whether I learned from the telling of funny stories at campfire, playing little practical jokes on each other, or just some old friendly card games of hearts, I really began to realize what the these times had meant to me. My best gal friend and I were expecting these three boys to join us all week. When the time came that they should arrive my friend and I started plotting out our secret plan. It was the boys duty before they could go out to the lake and start boating, to set up their tent. They managed to make a @NUM minute task take two hours, bravo to them. The three lost boys were at the water now as they had finally finished and could stand not to be anywhere but the lake any longer. While they were down swimming my friend and I took their hard worked tent and ripped out the stakes to collapse it first, only to then turn it inside out second. What better way to welcome new comers then to start off things with a good sense of humor.  The boys however didn't think it was quite so funny, however by @TIME fall they had a plan rising within them that my friend nor I knew was coming for us. Wake up call rolled around at about four in the @TIME for us two girls in a non-sound proof tent. We had a very loud wake up call that sounded as if the ducks were in a war zone against each other. We found out later, that the ducks found sandwiches mysteriously placed in a direct circle all around our tent. It was game on after the boys pulled that prank. It's hard for guys to get you back, if they're stuck in a tent. A zip tie would do the job. In the middle of the @TIME, sneakily crawl over and zip tie their zippers together. Just as my friend and I thought this was the perfect way to get the boys back, one of our co-partners went and told the guys our plan. The three amigos then wanted to turn around and do it to us first. The next @TIME my friend and I woke, we tried to climb out of the tent and that was a little hard to do. Our zippers were tied together and that's not so great of mix when you have us girls that really need to use the restroom. One of the boys had a pocket knife with him and he was playing like cat and mouse with us, barely letting the knife out of our reach. When I finally had hold of the small blade, I ripped open the zippers, gently tossed the knife to the ground and ran to the ladies room. When I got back to blood on the ground, I found that it wasn't as gentle of a toss as I thought it was. The same guy that gave us the knife to use, put his foot in the way of the ever so slightly tossed knife. Once he was home his mom took him to the hospital to get stitches. Campfire that @TIME was a hoot. Cards together was hilarious too because by the end we knew how each person was going to play, pretty much we knew who would win and who would come in dead @TIME. Even with someone having a cut open foot we were on the ground rolling around because we're laughing so hard. My gal friend and I took off the make up and jeans, put on a baggy sweatshirt and up do with our hair and really just had a great time that @TIME. It was the @TIME together there on the camping trip and it was nice to know we were having a good time laughing, with just being our self's and expressing without trying to impress. Later as we're all talking about these stories and jokes pulled on each other, we came to recognize that these are the kinds of moments people live for. Laughing brought us closer together, we weren't friends before and now after our times shared we're exceptionally close best friends. Our friend relationship with each other was brought into contact by laughing in harmony together, by the @TIME spent together, by harmless little jokes played on each other, by turning a camping trip in to something much more meaningful.",25,21,0.0,46,0.0,0.0,0.0,46.0
12808,21414,8," Can you imagine life without laughter? Life would be so serious, and relationships would be so boring. That favorite comedy? Not funny. America's @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS's, how can you not laugh! Laughter is a way to express emotions in a positive manor. What is it that relationships are built off of? Honesty, trust, understanding, and humor. Do you really want to be around someone @CAPS is boring? Because I don't. I believe strong friendships and relationships need laughter in them to keep them interesting. Many of my relationships have begun from a joke, laughter, or me being clumsy. I remember being in a class where I knew no one, and this is a very awkward situation to be in. I sat in the back of the class, with one other person, her name was @PERSON. It started off quite and no on saying anything, so I decided to tell an extremely cheesy joke. As soon as I told it, there was a silence afterward, where we just stared at each other. Seconds later we busted out in laughter, you know the kind of uncontrollable laugh, where you cannot breath, and your tear ducts are overwhelmed to the point where tears slide down your cheeks? When this happened there is a sudden bond, a spark of friendship between the two of us. From that point we were inseparable. For the rest of the school year, we were partners on every project, multitasking our way through them. Half the time we would be making up funny scenarios, and laughing until we cried. The other half we would have make a fantastic project using the inspiration of each other to get the work done. I am an all around ""laughter enthusiast!"" I can make the smallest things funny, its a quality I enjoy very much @CAPS knew a silly joke could go so far? Laughter cannot be the only element to a developed relationship, you need trust, honesty and various qualities to keep a healthy relationship. My point is, how can you maintain a friendship with someone @CAPS you can laugh with, or be yourself with? It is human nature to laugh, you can't always be serious. I don't think that I could go a day without laughing. Laughing can be the antidote for a frown. Moral of the story, laugh!",21,20,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0
12809,21415,8," For my family laughter is important to us because it just means that my parents aren't fighting that day. I was about nine years old and it was the week of @DATE. My parents had been fighting all day, for me it seemed like it would never end. Usually @DATE was what I looked forward to all year, but now I just wanted it to be over. I hated seeing my parents fight, because it always scared my little brother. My little sister was too young to know what was going on, but whenever they started fighting around her, she started to scream and yell. When my parents fought I tried to keep my brother and sister busy but that never kept me busy. I still heard everything they said and it seemed to never stop.  My sister was about one year old and when my parents fought she came into my room a lot because it was the farthest room from where the yelling was going on. We would watch @CAPS and play games until it stopped. Once, it went on for so long that she fell asleep in my room and I ended up taking her to her bed that night. There were so many times where I wished my parents would just stop fighting and realize that it not only makes them upset, it made all of us upset.  Well, the day before @DATE eve my mom was at work and my dad had to go to work too. Since my moms work doesn't allow kids to be there, my dad took us along. I could tell he had been up late because he had dark circles under his eyes and he had forgotten to shave that @TIME. Since, we were all on break from school, my whole day was spent making sure my little sister didn't get into mischief or get hurt. I had fun at my dads work because I loved playing with my little sister. My sister still wobbled when she walked so it made me laugh when we would play tag because she could never run fast enough and it made me laugh just to see her try. She loved it too because walking now gave her so much more freedom but she got herself into a lot more mischief now. On days when my dad didn't have much to do, he would have me help him try and teach my brother how to ride a two wheeler. It was a lot of fun seeing my brother try new things and have fun with it. It made us all laugh that day because he was so excited and happy that he could do something that he couldn't do before.  When @DATE eve came my parents agreed to stop fighting for the next few days because they wanted us to be happy on @DATE @TIME. Except that night they had a really big fight after they thought all of us had gone to bed. I had stayed up that night really late cause I was watching a bunch of my favorite @CAPS movies. I had just turned the @CAPS off when I heard them yelling. I didn't get much sleep that night because of all the yelling and screaming. Luckily, my brother and sister were already asleep and I didn't have to worry about them. The next @TIME, I didn't know what to expect from my parents. Everything was how it normally was on @DATE @TIME. There were gifts under the tree and stuff in our stockings. My brother came in and woke me up and said that everyone was out in the living room waiting for me to get my butt out of bed. I got out of bed, put my robe and my slippers on and went out to the living room. What I saw when I got out there was not at all what I had expected. My brother was sorting the presents so that everyone had their own pile. My dad was laughing at my sister, who was trying to pick up a presents that was as tall as her. And my mom was in the kitchen making everyones favorite breakfast, chocolate chip pancakes, bacon, and sausage. Everyone seemed so much happier then they had been the last few days.  As we all ate our breakfast and opened presents, I realized this was the first @TIME in a while that my parents haven't fought. It made me really happy to see them getting along. We all laughed and had a great time that @DATE @TIME. The rest of the day was great too. Laughter is still a big part in my family, even though my parents are separated now. It's a lot better now because we have a lot more moments of laughter and being happy then being upset and having to listen to them fight all the time. Now that we are happy and laugh a lot more, being at home is alot better. I really do believe laughter plays a big part in any family.",20,15,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12810,21416,8,"Many people believe that laughter is a key part of any relationship. There are many times when even the slightest laugh is needed to break the tension, or even just relieve some stress every once in a while. It is often said that laughter is the best medicine, and also the cheapest. Laughter is easily found and common to come by. In my case, laughter comes naturally to my sister and I and for no particular reason at all; it not only saved, but it built our relationship to what it is today.   When we were younger, my older sister and I did not get along very well at all. She would always tease me, then laugh about it; and I too would laugh at things that she did not find humorous in any way, shape, or form. This constantly caused conflict and many arguments between the two of us; therefore we hated each other and, in a sense, wanted nothing to do with each other.  As my sister and I grew older and wiser, we started to become much more alike. We still made fun of, teased, antagonized, and pulled childish pranks on each other; but instead of getting angry, we would just laugh about it instead. As we continued to make each other laugh, we found ourselves getting along so much better. Soon after that, we began hanging out more and more and just for the fun of it, not because our parents told us too. Before we knew it, my sister and I were best friends.  It is rare to hear about siblings being best friends. I am lucky to be able to say that my older sister is my best friend. Personally, I feel that laughter has played a huge roll in the relationship between my older sister and I. Now we depend on each other because we both know that no matter what, we can always make one another laugh and virtually cheer each other up. We hang out when we need to get away or when we have something that we need to get off our chests. We know we have each other for that because we know we can always laugh about it in the end.",20,19,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12811,21418,8," Laughter is an interesting emotion. It's one that you expect to feel when you are happy or humorous. This, however, isn't always the case. Some people laugh when they're embarrassed or uncomfortable. Others, when they're enraged and upset. And then, there are people who laugh when they are grieving or sad. People don't expect that to happen. To laugh when you are depressed. It is strange but true. I know this from personal experience, which led up to one of the most tragic events of my short life.  I was about nine. The age @CAPS you're hyper and energetic almost nonstop. I had just arrived home from school and walked in the front door. My mom was waiting for @CAPS inside. ""@CAPS on @CAPS,"" she said. ""We're going to see your grandparents for a few hours."" I was upset. I was not only tired and hungry, but I had to drive almost an hour away to see my grandparents. So I did what any nine year old would do. I cried, whined and pleaded her not to go. She didn't listen of course. She toned @CAPS out, waited until I was out of air, and then picked @CAPS up and tossed @CAPS in the car.  Isn't taking a nap great? That's exactly what I did on the ride over. I was clapped-out, so I felt it was alright to have a little ""@CAPS"" time. When we got to their house, I had just woken up and didn't feel like moving. I had to force myself to get up and say hello. It was depressing, yet fascinating really. Seeing your grandparents is like seeing a glimpse of the future. In the sense that you know what your going to look like when you're old. They had candy though, which was tasty and mouth-watering. We actually stayed for quite a few hours. My mom called my dad a couple of times asking if we could go home, but we never did. She just had a conversation with my grandparents while I watched television. At last, my dad finally called to say we could @CAPS home. We said goodbye and booked it before it was too dark out. By the time we got home, it was pitch-black outside. We still hadn't eaten yet and I was starving. I jumped out of the car and walked over to the gate that separated the front yard from the back. I shook the gate, expecting three delighted dogs to run up and start jumping on the gate wanting to play. Instead, only two showed. ""@CAPS's @CAPS?"" I wondered. I thought he was most likely eating or sleeping so I decided to just go inside and eat. When I opened the door to the house, both of my parents were standing in the entry way. I could tell they were trying to hold back tears. Then it hit @CAPS like a ton of bricks. ""@CAPS passed away,"" my mom said. I froze. I didn't believe them. I couldn't. My best friend in the world was gone. I cried for hours, possibly more. I didn't know what to do. Then something weird happened. I started to laugh. I don't know why I did. Maybe it's because I wanted to try to cheer myself up. Or maybe, I realized he was in a better place. To this day I still feel an empty space in my heart @CAPS my best friend once was. I still think about why I laughed that day. I think about why we laugh in general. Whether it's when you're happy, angry, or even sad, we laugh to try to get by and make the best of both good and bad situations. As tragic as the situation was, I can't help but feel happy. My best friend was in pain and could barely walk, so we had to euthanize him. I knew it was the right thing to do, and quite frankly, I don't think I would have felt better if I hadn't laughed that night. It was awkward at first. It felt wrong and terrible, but it helped @CAPS more than I could have ever anticipated.",20,25,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12812,21419,8,"The @CAPS of Laughter   The @CAPS of a single laugh is quite an astonishing thing. Laughter has a strange way to either bring two people together or when used wrongly tear those people apart. In all of my relationships I have realized that being able to joke around and laugh with one another is a big deal. I have come to notice lately that I have an amazing best friend. @PERSON is always here for me even after the mistake I made that ended tearing us apart. Now that we have gotten over The @CAPS and can laugh about it, I've realized it makes being embarrassed a lot easier and brings me and my friends together. Even when a best friend does something that wasn't right and neither one wants to fix it.   The @CAPS began last @DATE during my @CAPS soccer season, and should have never gone as far as it did or involved one of my friends. It was the hardest thing to admit that I had done wrong; both to her and him. The day we had gotten caught is now what I consider the scariest and worst day of my life. The @CAPS has also become a big learning point in my life, I've learned that all my actions do have consequences and how to balance what I want with what I should actually do.   When I first started soccer for @CAPS, I had never played with any of the people and I realized that by being the youngest on a @NUM team I would have to stand out and prove myself. Which is exactly what I did; just not to the whole team. After playing for about two weeks I had started to notice one of the boys who was on my team. I hadn't really thought much about it but when both me and him started to pursue our relationship it became a whole other thing. The boy and I had been dating for about a month and a half when this began to involve @PERSON. See we weren't exactly allowed to hang out or even date for that matter, but we knew that we would take the chance of getting into trouble for each other. And as time went on and we had began to get closer to each other, we also had began falling in love. That @MONTH have been the reason I had chosen what I had but at the time it all seemed to make perfect sense.    Then the @ORGANIZATION came around and we thought it would be the perfect time to see each other, little did we know this choice would result in us losing each other, me losing my freedom, both of us ruining my parent's trust and the worst of all me throwing away a great friend. We didn't think of these consequences so we went through with it. He would meet me at the @ORGANIZATION and I would tell my parents that I was just going to be with @PERSON. At the beginning and throughout most of the time everything was going well me and him were having an amazing time because we could finally hang out with one another and nobody knew what was really going on. Little did I know that my mother had called @PERSON's mom to make sure that I was going to be were I said and with who I said, and as soon as she found out I wasn't everything went down hill from there.    It had already been a couple hours and we were starting to get hungry but neither of us wanted to eat the greasy food at the @ORGANIZATION so we decided to take yet another chance and leave, with me leaving @PERSON at the @ORGANIZATION and her not knowing were I went. As my mom became more and more worried she starting calling @PERSON to see were I was and of course @PERSON had no idea. On her list to call next was me. When my mom first tried calling me I decided not to answer and have her think i was just on a ride or something, but when she kept calling I knew that something was wrong. As I answered the phone I knew that she knew what I had been doing, but I still didn't want to believe what was happening. I thought that the only way my mom could have found out was because @PERSON called and told her that she couldn't find me and who I was with.    So that is what I ended up accusing @PERSON of for at least a month after it happened. I couldn't look at her or even talk to her with out feeling resentment and embarrassment. When everything finally settled down, from being caught to being grounded the whole @DATE, I knew that I needed to apologize for the position I put @PERSON in. It was the hardest thing I have ever done. But now knowing that @PERSON and I can laugh about it makes remembering that time so much easier and better.",20,23,0.0,43,0.0,0.0,0.0,43.0
12813,21421,8," Green is not my favorite colorLaughter is an indulging part of life that a variety of people @MONTH enjoy or @MONTH not enjoy. Humor happens to be infectious. The sound of roaring laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze. When laughter is shared upon one another, it binds people together and increases happiness and intimacy. Having to pick out one of the million laughter memories I have had was nearly impossible for me to decide, because every moment I spend opening my mouth and bursting out my ""ha-ha-ha"" with joy and excitement. I try to indulge the person I spent it with and the exact memory that happened.  It was the @DATE, @CAPS for many of us @DATE is one of the most enthusiastic times of our twelve months in the year. I was going to be hosting a pool party with all of my friends, @CAPS I needed to clean it out because it happened to be awfully disgusting from all the year long seasons that the weather decided to bring down. I didn't think it would be that much of a deal because that was the only way I would be able to host my party with my parents permission. @CAPS if you know me well enough, I am the average typical teenage girl that probably texts more than @NUM texts a day. So since I can't keep my white, somewhat sweaty hands off my phone you @MONTH already have a feeling of what happens next. If you taught I dropped it. Your absolutely wrong. Not surprisingly after cleaning out my pool for about one hour I finally finished, @CAPS I texted my boyfriend telling him that my pool was no longer green anymore. He replied with "".......?"" I questioned myself if I had sent the wrong message to the wrong person so I checked my history and it turns out that I had wrote to him, "" @CAPS my poop is no longer green anymore."" I was literally mortified. I didn't know what emotion to feel or what to expect from him later that day. I decided to just pretend it didn't happen anymore. So later that day my pool party started. Everyone showed up and looked at me in a weird way then usual @CAPS I was to ecstatic and pumped to my favorite song by my favorite singer @NUM. As everyone showed up they all had a present bag in there hand, I wondered to myself why they brought presents if it wasn't anybody's birthday it was just a casual pool party to welcome everyone's favorite season, @DATE. So I asked the question to my best friend and she told me, ""@CAPS we know its nobody's birthday @CAPS @CAPS texted all of us telling us you had green poop, and you were not feeling well so we went to @CAPS to buy you @CAPS-@CAPS, and @CAPS @CAPS ."" I was petrified and to be honest actually laughing insanely hard. So I stood up in front of all my guest and told them what had really happened and we all laughed historically. Without exception we kept the party going, and I eventually saw my boyfriend coming. I walked up to him and all we did was laugh with compassion and didn't mention one word about what had happened.   Once the party was over and it became dawn we decided to have a bonfire and get cozy with our loved one, and just all us friends bond with one another. You can guess what happened next, we began to talk about what had happened earlier and I can honestly say I don't think I have laughed that hard in my fifteen years alive. Rapidly our curfew had almost expired for the day, so all my friends left and they made a nickname for me, ""@CAPS."" @CAPS the funniest part about this story that I will never forget is, that when all my friends left, my boyfriend decided to take me out and get a burger at our local, also known as the best hamburgers in our town. As we finished eating a mother came along with her baby boy. I had to take a few seconds out of my life to carry it, and make my dummy looking face in order to make it jiggle a bit. @CAPS little did I know that the baby had just eaten. So you can imagine what happens next, green vomit gets all over me. I was honestly not mad, nor embarrassed. I just laughed so hard that I could feel my abs working out and tears from my eyes coming out. I believe in each and everyone of our lives we all have a special moment we desire to worship forever. It @MONTH be sad, embarrassing or even a comical quality type of moment we indulge in our memory. So till this day I am still known as ""@CAPS"" to my friends, and there is no doubt that I will ever forget this memory.",18,23,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0
12814,21422,8," Laughter in someones life is very important for many different reasons. You can get to know someone by what they think is funny, show emotion and become closer to others by simply laughing together. The memories that are the clearest to anyone or are most personal might have laughter in them. These are also the memories that people would want to remember vividly. I think the quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is extremely accurate for most. I have many memories of laughter with my friends, family and loved ones around me. I will never forget some stories I have had in life because of all the laughter in them. When I was about six and my brother was about nine we didn't always get along, being the typical brother and sister that we were. We both had very outgoing personalities and had to be doing something at all times. When we did get along we usually had so much fun, ended up rolling around laughing together, and forgetting that we were ever mad at each other. Some of the things we would do would be to play hide and seek inside and outside our house, tag, bored games, and our favorite thing of all was tickle monster. Sometimes our closest friends would play with us but it was usually just something my family did. Most of the time me and my brother would ask my dad to play with us because playing games with two people wasn't very fun at the time. He usually agreed because he enjoyed watching us laugh together and create new memories and stories. When the three of us got together and played games I felt like I was on top of the world and I was really happy at that point in my life. My favorite time that I can think of playing games with them was when we started off by playing hide and seek in our house. Me and my brother usually crammed into little spaces like under the sink, under beds and in closets. We couldn't fit in them for very long because they were very hard to get into even for a little kid. My dad being a lot bigger than us kids would always hide in the shower or behind doors. He was really easy to find but we still found it really fun and laughed every time we found him. One of the times when it was his turn to hide me and my brother went to my room to count to any number we felt like. We were inpatient little kids so we didn't usually count all the way to the number my dad told us to. Then we ran down our stairs, turned the corner, ran down the hall and found him hiding behind the bathroom door. You could always tell if he was there or not because if he was the door wouldn't open all the way. Instead of coming out of hiding when we found him and counting for us while we hid, he started to chase us around the house. We weren't expecting it at all so we were laughing and running and it was hard to breath. Eventually he caught up to us and our game of hide and seek turned into the best game of tickle monster ever! My brother thought we should hide under my parents blanket on their bed but that just made us an easier target for my dad the tickle monster.  By the time he was done tickling us, our faces were red, we were out of breath, tired and had the biggest smiles on our faces from laughing. Trying to breath, trying to get away and laugh all at the same time really tired us out. My dad eventually got us out to the table where we had our lunch and then we all fell asleep with our belly's full and as happy as could be.  That was a really fun memory I have with lots of laughter and good times. To me, laughing is a big part of getting to know someone and strengthening already existing relationships. It puts everyone in a good mood and keeps people happy.",21,20,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0
12815,21424,8," Laughter is the expression of being happy, being able to be yourself around the people you care about, and expressing your feelings. Anyone can share laughter with anyone, even if someone you dont know very well or someone you have known for a long time and dont talk anymore, make someone else feel good by sharing a laugh with them. Last year my close friend, @LOCATION and I were together all the time almost everyday. We always make other laugh at the silliest little things, even if no one else understands what we are talking about. We can make laughter out of any small thing. We hang out a lot so that makes it easier to share our laughter with each other. One day in class we were just sitting in class reading a book and I turn around, there she is sleeping, with drool coming out of her mouth. The room was quiet, I was trying not to laugh really hard I started giggling. I poked her and she woke up and had her hair stuck to the side of her face. It was so funny, I couldnt hold it in anymore. She had a confused look on her face then I pulled out my mirror and showed her what I was laughing at, then she started laughing too. She fixed her hair and wiped the drool away. Then the teacher walked over to us and asked us if we had a problem. We looked at each other and giggled then replied with no we do not have a problem here.  The next day we were walking to the commons after we had come back from @ORGANIZATION and we heard one girl say to another girl, ""is that all you do is talk crap about your sister?"" @CAPS girl was not a regular girl, she had purple faded dyed hair and teeth that stuck out over her bottom lip, which made the whole thing even more hilarious. @LOCATION and I looked at each other and were like holy crap did that really just happen right there? We started laughing after we were out of ear shot so she could not hear us laughing at her. We laughed about that for the rest of the year. Everytime we saw her after that we called her ""girl with purple hair"", because no other girl at our school at the time had purple hair so it was really easy to spot her out of a crowd. Still to @CAPS day laugh every once in a while about that situation.   A few weeks later after @CAPS had happened we had seen her former boyfriend hanging out with a group of girls so we went closer to see who they were, I did not know any of them, but I saw a couple of them and knew that they were freshman. @LOCATION gives them a dirty look and says he definately down graded since I dated him. There was one certain girl that was literally hanging all over him. She was not even pretty at all. She had a short hair cut, but her hair was all greasy, it was like she had put lots of gel or had not taken a shower in two days. The girl was wearing clothes that were obviously way too small for her, you could see half of her upper body just exposed there. It was really trashy. We started laughing really hard because it was so obvious she was trying to get his attention and he was totally ignoring her. @LOCATION looked at me and we both starting laughing. I am not really sure what she was laughing at, because I was laughing at the girl hanging all over @LOCATION's former boyfriend.   The next day we were in @CAPS @CAPS class and I made a comment about someone was being stupid and a student in the classroom tried to get me in trouble fo rit, but luckily my teacher liked me a lot better than the other student, because that person got in trouble way more frequently than I have. Later on in the day I got called down to the office because the vice principal needed to speak to me. He said @CAPS student has a problem with me calling him stupid. I have had lots of issues with @CAPS person and I told the vice principal that he is very obnxious, and I also explained everything else that happened earlier. The vice principal told me that I am not in trouble because he was trying to start an issue. We laughed because he tried to get me in trouble and it did not work, then we both laughed because that student is a trouble maker.  I have learned that throughout life you need to have a good laugh every now and then because laughter expresses your feelings and sometimes it just makes you feel really good. I know that with my experience I need to have those close people to make me laugh, also to get me through anything that I am going through.",20,18,36.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12816,21425,8," Many people say that the people who laugh more live longer. I remember when I was ten years old, I was going to learn how to ride a bike. Little did I know it was going to be a hard task. My brother said I didn't need training wheels. Although I was scared, looking at other kids ride their bikes made me gather up courage to learn how to ride a bike.  It was the big day, it was a perfect day to learn how to ride a bike. As I walked down the stairs all geared up and ready I began to feel @LOCATION. I went outside, my big brother was waiting for me. He had a helmet and the bike, he began to go over the basic rules. Slowly I started to get on the bike, I was confident I could do it.  Next it was time to gear up and put my helmet on. My heart was pounding, I could feel my blood going through my veins. Giving the first peddle I fell and hit the ground extremely hard. All I wanted to do was run home and cry on my moms lap. I looked up at my brother, he asked me if I was okay. Up until this day I can remember laughing instead of crying, after all crying wasn't going to make the pain go away nor teach me how to ride a bike.  Finally, I got back on that bike and peddled and peddled. I can remember my brother telling me that laughter is the best medicine around. I was laughing as a peddled, sometimes I think that maybe laughter is what made me accomplish my goal to learn how to ride a bike. in my life laughing and smiling and having fun is a big deal.

12817,21426,8," When I was adopted, I didn't know what to expect. Thoughts ran through my mind of what the @CAPS and @CAPS were like, what the home was like, and if they would like me or not. I was told I was going to have two new sisters named @PERSON and @CAPS. Sitting in the passenger seat of the black @ORGANIZATION @CAPS my heart began to pound harder and harder at the passing of every street, coming closer each second to the home that I would soon be able to call my own. Approaching the driveway I saw a well laid out, one story blue house. The door was opened by a really tall well built man, who appeared to just have gotten off of work. He was very welcoming and said his name was @CAPS, as he invited me in I was greeted by a white pit bull whose name was @CAPS. To the right was a girl with short hair who was a little bit taller than little five foot three inch me, whose name was @CAPS. I was a year older than her though, so I saw it as a fun thing to have a little sister. At first I didn't notice she was observing me and then finally when I did notice, she gave me a really big smile exposing her beautiful straight teeth. When I met @CAPS who said her name was @PERSON, I automatically felt this warm feeling of acceptance right away. She was also a little bit taller than me, and was very pretty. They told me that I would be meeting @PERSON, my older sister the following @DATE because she was attending college in @LOCATION at @ORGANIZATION. We stood in the kitchen and talked a little bit trying to get to know the basics about each other. I became very talkative as little electric currents of anxiety drifted through my body. We talked about our interests for a while, and then I finally asked them what the rules were. The response I got was quite different than what I thought I was going to get. I learned that they have never had to ground any of the girls, the only thing that I should make sure to do is simply respect everyone in the household. Finally @CAPS decided it was time for the grand tour of the home. My room was a bed room that at the moment was being used as a storage room, so I had to stay with @CAPS in her room for a few weeks until @CAPS could get all of the things taken out into a shed he was going to built outside in the back yard. The continuous rain kept him from being able to do anything outside, so instead he built a desk for the computer that would fit in the bay window next to the kitchen. Since plan A didn't work out for my room, @CAPS ended up having the office be converted into my room and the bay window area was converted into an office space for @CAPS to be able to run his business. Each week that passed I began to feel more comfortable, my favorite part of the day was dinner because @CAPS was a really great cook. @CAPS would take me to counseling sessions to make the transition into the family an easy one. I have never had any one put my needs first before, and it made me feel loved for once in my life. It was always really easy to talk to @CAPS and @CAPS, but I would always find it a little bit harder to talk to @CAPS. I was always worrying about saying too much or not saying enough, even not being able to say the right thing at the right time. Trying to connect with my sister was a challenge for me. I wanted to get to know what her interests were, but she would constantly be with her friends or be doing her homework.  It wasn't until my @ORGANIZATION was having a @CAPS @CAPS fundraiser that we decided to go. She invited her friend @PERSON and I went along to pay for their ice cream. When we arrived and got our ice creams we all sat down at a table when all of a sudden, @ORGANIZATION's @ORGANIZATION friends show up and decide to leave @CAPS. I see the hurt in @CAPS's stare right away, so I began to tell her a funny story of something that had happened to me. After I was done we laughed and then she replied with a story of her own. We kept talking back and forth in a reciprocal conversation, and without realizing it we were really enjoying ourselves. It wasn't until later that week when I went to see the counselor that I learned laughter brings people together and connects them in ways one cannot imagine. To this day @CAPS and I are really close, and we even prank each other now. I love my little sister @CAPS.",21,20,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0
12818,21427,8," Laughter helps in so many situations throughout life. When your angry, sad, nervous or even mourning. Laughing about the good times @CAPS had with an old friend, or realizing a situation isn't scary or sad but is really quite hilarious. Many times throughout my life when things happened that made me in someway or another upset, the people close to me always helped by making me laugh. Realizing whatever was happening was not as bad as I had thought. Which made me look on the positive and light-hearted side of things. A specific situation happened when I was about nine years old. In school most kids at some time or another say something hurtful or without thinking. While parents should teach their children better it seems to be in their nature to make thoughtless observations, some times hurting others by drawing attention to flaws. I was sitting in class working on an art project. There was three other kids at my group and we were talking about who knows what, it was so many years ago. But then on boy starts talking about weight and how he is so tough and muscular, and yes were all eight or nine years old but he thought he was being cool. So he turns to me and says ""@CAPS are not in shape, your fat"". This crushed me how was I suppose to reply to this. I tried to act as if it didn't bother me. I went on to finish my art project. I could not help but hear repeating in my head those evil words that stung me. My eyes started to tear up and soon a drop of water appeared on my paper, I could not hold back the tears. I was waiting for the bell to ring so I could get out if this terrible place and go home to people who were smarter then to say things like that boy did. As I got off the bus I was already feeling the emotions rising to the surface. Starting to bawl as my mom opened the door. She exclaimed ""@CAPS what's the matter, what happened?"" @CAPS tears I relayed the terrible scene. She felt bad for me and asked the boys name. I told her @PERSON. She began to laugh and say ""That chubby kid with the buck teeth?, oh honey don't let that bother @CAPS he isn't in shape at all"". I started to laugh realizing he did have buck teeth. The tears stopped coming to my eyes and I really realized the whole situation. He was being thoughtless and bragging about himself, which the statement were not even true and I was not fat. Laughing made me feel better and realize how silly it all was. Laughter really did help me realize it wasn't so bad. I was still a little embarrassed but I was over it. Laughing also got my mind off of what @PERSON said to me. Of course even though he said a thoughtless comment to me, I would not have said a thoughtless commend about any of this flaws. But laughing about how he had buck teeth made me feel better. Laughing also made me see how I was making a big deal out of a little situation, also. ",17,18,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0

I sit in a room that I don't want to because of my actions. My life was perfect before I had my brothers my parents and my love of my life. Now I look back on how nothing is worth taking me away from them. The laughs I'm missing out on right now is what hurts most, because I could be at home or even at school right now. Instead I'm here without my laughs, my brothers, my parents, and my love. Trying to put a smile on my face even though I know I'm happy.

I get about fourty five minutes to and hour and a half every day to talk to her and my family and it deffinently hurts more then what you could imagine. having to talk on the phone that you can barely hear their threw it just kills me.

Alot effects my brothers though and I know they don't understand but hopefully one day they will. hearing my little brother @CAPS over the phone crying because he can't see me. It just hurts inside even writing about this right now makes me want to just break down in tears. I almost fell like could in front of these other kids that are in here too.

This year, as a high school sophomore, I decided to do something I'd never done before: go out for the basketball team. I was inspired by a longing to become more involved in the school district, and to be able to exercise throughout the rain-drenched winter months in which @CAPS took place. Having only picked up a basketball in order to steer clear of the ""sit-outs"" zone in middle school @LOCATION, my performance at early practices was comparable to that of a high school dropout determining the orbit of the planets around the sun; and at least they get a calculator. Naturally the year I decided to give basketball a shot, the coaches informed us that seven unlucky individuals would be plucked from the team with joyous abandon. Through sheer force of determination, I improved enough in our first few weeks to be deemed ""better than dirt"" by the coaches; narrowly avoiding losing my spot on the team. In the months ahead, I would learn that my job wouldn't be making baskets and stealing balls... As astonishing as @CAPS was, my ability to imagine myself playing basketball far surpassed my actual skills on the court. I soon found that my place on the team wouldn't be aggressively running up and down the court fighting for control of an orange ball; I would be on the sidelines, cheeks firmly planted on the bench upon which my teammates would take breathers before going back into the action.  Our team could play basketball, but not often on the same level as the teams we faced. As each game came and went, I could see the fighting spirit fizzling out of my peers' eyes; their morale was simply dropping, and no amount of my ball-playing abilities could change that.  @CAPS was one game in particular twhen I discovered I didn't have to play in order to help my team. @CAPS was a home game, in our lower gym; we were down by about @NUM points against a team we had fared @CAPS against previously. Needless to say, players were becoming very frustrated. One of our star players, @PERSON, was becoming so frustrated that our coaches decided to pull him out for a breather. He was raging, spitting profanities. He dropped himself on the bench with the elegance of an enraged walrus. His mom came down from the stands to give him water, which only made him embarrassed him more. Sitting beside @PERSON, I could feel the anger radiating off of him. He was ranting under his breath over number @NUM, the opposing team's point guard. I noticed that while @NUM's fast legs and swift hands made him a great ball-player, his voice -- a good octave above his teammates' -- was much more @CAPS suited for covering @ORGANIZATION songs than calling out plays. I turned towards @PERSON, tapping him on the shoulder, and informed him of my insight. He looked at me for a moment, a mixture of anguish and ""don't-talk-to-me-or-I-will-murder-@CAPS"" on his face before bursting out laughing. Clapping me on the back, he said with a smile: ""@CAPS always know @CAPS to make us laugh, @PERSON"". Suddenly @CAPS dawned on me that my banter and dripping sarcasm was quite often the one thing keeping smiles on my teammates' faces. I was able to use @CAPS to diffuse tense situations, and allow emotions to flow freely in a more positive manner. We lost the game. In fact, we lost all but one game the entire season; and so I made @CAPS my personal duty to keep the entire team in good spirits even in the worst of times. As the weeks went by, I started to feel more and more an integral part of the team; making teammates laugh kept their minds clear of anger and frustration, and allowed them to play to the best of their abilities.  And so @CAPS was. Some players had quick hands, others had a flawless shot. Me? I made people laugh. I gave my peers, my friends, the ability to see light in even the most dire of situations. I didn't receive an award, a recognition of athletic ability. Instead I found the satisfaction of making people smile, of watching the enraged despair on their faces disappear -- replaced with optimism and hope. Laughter is what pushed my teammates past anger, to be the best they could be. So, @CAPS tell me: Is laughter simply noise that a person makes when something is funny, or is @CAPS something more?  Spoiler alert: @CAPS's much, much more.",30,25,0.0,55,0.0,0.0,0.0,55.0
12821,21431,8," Laughter plays an important role in everyone's lives. Different laughs represent various things. For instance, have @CAPS ever heard someone chuckle and know right away that they are being sarcastic, or maybe even sympathetic? A laugh can say a lot. I'm going to tell @CAPS about the time my friend fell into an @NUM pond.  In early @DATE, my friend was visiting me at my house for a week. The third morning of her stay, we woke up and it had snowed seven inches @TIME. I was used to the soft, white flakes spiraling through the air, @CAPS @CAPS was from @LOCATION and had never seen snow before. As my friend was listing all of the things @CAPS wanted to do that day, @CAPS let out the most anxious laugh I had ever heard. I could tell @CAPS just wanted to go outside that very moment. Of course @CAPS knew it was going to be cold but I didn't think @CAPS knew how cold. I told her it was going to be chillier than what @CAPS might be expecting.  We got dressed in numerous layers of clothing: socks, pants, shirts, and jackets so we could head out. As we were walking down the snowy hill @CAPS spotted the @NUM pond on the lower half of my property and hurled towards it. @CAPS asked if we could go swimming, I laughed a sarcastic laugh and answered, ""heck no!"" @CAPS walked toward a massive log that lays across the water and decided to cross it. @CAPS said that if I didn't go with her @CAPS would push me in. So I took a step back, @CAPS just looked down and continued walking. As @CAPS stepped onto the log that was glazed with ice @CAPS got a little cocky and decided to jump around to show me it was ""fun."" I laughed at the funny movements @CAPS was making and whispered, ""@CAPS're going to fall."" All of a sudden @CAPS slipped and the ice cracked. It reminded me of glass shattering on a cement floor. This picture in front of me was almost as if it was in slow motion; I can remember her hands reaching up to grasp the log before @CAPS fell in to the freezing water. @CAPS fell through, I bounded @TIME to help her out, I slowly pulled her out of the pond. I looked at her after I had harpooned onto the log and we both burst out in laughter...although her teeth were chattering and her multiple layers of clothing we soaked, I knew @CAPS was @CAPS going to cherish this moment because it was her first snow experience.  Walking up to the house @CAPS giggled, ""I should have listened to @CAPS huh?"" I nodded my head and suggested we take off her clothes to ring out and put in the dryer.We changed into pajamas and sipped on hot chocolate and coffee all day long, sharing laughter and smiles. I will @CAPS remember this day because there were so many different stories I can tell from it.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12822,21432,8," Laughter forms a bond between two people; a good laugh can turn an uncomfortable situation into a pleasant one. A fantastic example of the power of laughter would be the first time I met my mother's boyfriend. My father died when I was thirteen and since then I had stubbornly resented each new man my mother attempted to bring into my life. This iron clad resolution ended when my two sisters and myself sat down to dinner with @ORGANIZATION. One @DATE @TIME, my mother announced that she had invited her new boyfriend over meet her children. My sisters and I were forced to scrub the house from top to bottom in order to prepare for our guest, while my mother cooked a giant pan of lasagna. When the house was clean and the dinner was cooked, I dressed for this most grievous occasion. My obsessive compulsive mother made me change clothes at least thirty times before she deemed me presentable enough to meet the man whose existence I was beginning to despise. At precisely six thirty in the @TIME, @PERSON's blue @ORGANIZATION pulled into our driveway. I shot my mother a steely eyed glare as I opened the door for the buffoon; thus, a most dreaded dinner began.  My determined hatred began to soften as soon as I saw @PERSON, but it was by no means expired. @PERSON was tall and tan, a few years older than my mother judging by his wrinkle strewn skin and the silver streaked through his dark hair and matching mustache. He had the sort friendly, pleasant appearance that makes him immediately likable. My now giddy mother and her sullen children sat down to eat with the cheerful stranger. My younger sister warmed up to him first. She and @PERSON share a love of snakes, lizards and all things I deem ""creepy crawly."" A common interest brought them together before I knew it. My older sister adored @PERSON after a lively conversation about football ensued. @PERSON and my sister discovered they were both @CAPS fans, and consequently formed a bond over their team.  After winning my siblings over, @PERSON tried to charm me into liking him to. He attempted to talk of movies, music, sports, animals, even politics, but nut nothing he said could melt my icy disposition. I was determined to hate him from the start of the @TIME, and no amount of charisma would break my persistent stubbornness. Eventually he gave up on me, and focused on entertaining the people who did like him. Over dessert he jumped into a stand-up comedy routine cleverly disguised as a story about his recent flight to @LOCATION. He went on about the ridiculous security checks, the overly cheerful flight attendants who really hate their job, and the corny safety videos. I had tears of laughter in my eyes before I remembered that I had made a solemn vow to loath @PERSON. I fought hard to resume my former demeanor, but my will did not stand a chance against @ORGANIZATION's sense of humor. The triumphant smile and slick wink he shot me from across the table told me that he had won. Sure enough, we were the best of friends before the night ended.   Eventually @PERSON and I conversed about movies and music and found we had similar tastes in both, but our common interests had nothing to do with our friendship. They simply fueled the fire. The power of laughter brought us together like a magnet and a washer. Just as the shortest distance between to points is a straight line, laughter was the straight line between myself and @PERSON. He and my mother are still together, and ever since he came into our lives, laughter has been our constant companion.",27,20,50.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0
12823,21433,8," A @CAPS @CAPS The @CAPS @CAPS was a warm @DATE @CAPS, some of my friends and I had planned to spend a @CAPS @CAPS the @CAPS. We had decided on walking around and looking @CAPS all the cool stores. Eventually we would all get lunch and go out to the park near the river right next to the @CAPS. We all agreed that @CAPS was a great plan and we would all have a wonderful @CAPS. To start off, we all met @CAPS the bus stop by the movies. @PERSON, @PERSON, @PERSON, @CAPS and I were all there. We decided to go look inside @CAPS @CAPS first because they have all the crazy things we love. Inside the store, I found a dress that was to die for. @CAPS was small and grey with skulls all over @CAPS. Unfortunately, @CAPS costed @MONEY that i did not have, so we left @CAPS @CAPS. Next, we went to @NUM @CAPS to see what they had in store for us. @PERSON and I created a black teddy @PERSON with a studded leather jacket. We gave @CAPS an awsome top hat and named @CAPS @CAPS @PERSON. We all thought @CAPS was pretty funny because teddy bears are supposed to be cute and this one was kind of scary. We paid @MONEY for @CAPS and continued on our little adventure. We all decided @CAPS was about lunch time so we went and got chineese food from @ORGANIZATION, left the @CAPS, and headed down to the park next to the river. Before we got to the park, we stopped to go see what @CAPS was like under the bridge. There were towers of rocks all over the place, so we decided to build one of our own. We stacked @CAPS up almost as tall as me before @CAPS toppled over, almost crushing @PERSON on the way down. We followed the little path away from the rock towers down to the river. @CAPS lead us to a little beach next to the water. There was a huge pillar separating the trees and bushes from the water. We decided to eat lunch here instead of going to the park. After eating lunch, we were all full of energy again. @CAPS started a pine cone war by tagging me in the back of the head with one. After a few minutes, all of us were involved. We used the giant pillar from the bridge as a shield but @CAPS didn't quite work. @PERSON, who had a better aim than all of us, was hitting everyone left and right, so the rest of us teamed up on him. We all threw pine cones one after the other untill @PERSON had to start backing away. As he reached the edge of the shore, he tripped over a big rock and fell backwards into the shallow water. Instantly, we all busted out in a roar of laughter that continued on for a good couple of minutes before @CAPS finally decided on helping @PERSON out of the water. He was very unhappy about the situation while we were all quite pleased. Jesica had managed to get a vidio of the whole thing and when we played @CAPS back to @PERSON he couldn't help but laugh with us. After that, we went to the park. Immediately, we all ran for the slide. ""I wanna go first!"" screamed @PERSON as we all made @CAPS up the jungle jim to the slide. All of us pushed and shoved to get to the slide before I finally suggested going down the big, swirly slide all together. Everyone els thought @CAPS was a great idea so we attempted @CAPS. @PERSON was first, as she wanted, I was second, followed by @PERSON, @PERSON, and then @CAPS. We started off realy slow and progressed in speed as more of us piled onto the slide. We ended in a pile @CAPS the bottom, all laughing histarically. When we all came back to reality we realized @CAPS was time to head home so we all grabbed our things and headed for the bus stop. In the end, @CAPS had turned out to be an even better @CAPS than we had expected. The whole @CAPS was full of joy and laughter, whitch are a few of the key aspects of life. Without laughter, there would be no way to @ORGANIZATION when you are extremely happy or when you think something is funny. Happiness is one thing you need to live a fun, fulfilling life. I feel like the ability to laugh is one thing that makes a person fun to have around. Do you think you laugh often enough?",20,15,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0

This is the arrangements of who was in what trucks. It was @PERSON and I in my @CAPS @NUM, @PERSON and @PERSON in his tracker @NUM, and @PERSON and @PERSON in his @NUM wheel drive jeep @CAPS. When we started to head back down the mountain @PERSON let @PERSON drive down. @PERSON can't see very well at night because she wears glasses and her eye sights not very good. Well i was following them down the mountain and we finally got to the pavement and @PERSON was going pretty fast for that road because its a narrow curving road and that was the first time she had ever been on it before. She went to go around a really sharp corner and got up on two wheels and flipped over right in front of me so i had to slam on the brakes so that i wouldn't run into them. So i shut my truck off run over there as fast as i could and helped @PERSON out of the truck and when i turn back around to go help @PERSON out hes already on top of the truck.He looks at @PERSON ans says ""@CAPS look at what you did to my truck, i have tried many of times to roll it and never have been able to god damn you!"". So we all started laughing and then i got a chain out of the back of my truck and pulled him back over. Then it was really quite and @PERSON farted and we all started to laugh again. Well then @PERSON found out that he got a hole in his radiator i had to pull him back to his house and it seemed like the longest drive ever because his truck weighs way more than mine so i had to pull him home in @CAPS wheel drive and you cant go over thirty in @CAPS wheel drive because stuff can break. So we finally get to his house and his dad comes out side and he saw the truck and was really pissed because he gave that truck to him for a graduation present and he messed it all up. Then he finally cooled of cause he said no one was hurt and he was glad for that so we went in the house and ate dinner and went to bed.

12825,21436,8," We all know the benefits of laughter. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Is there anything more to laughter? Can one person be happy without laughing? I have never gone a day without laughing. I know the benefits of laughter. Do you? I know the benefits of laughter. Its truly amazing how something so simple can bring people together, make friends and fix relationships, or make someones day a little better if they are having a rough time. There was a time in ninth grade when my best friend and I got into an argument because I didn't ask him to be on our basketball team for a tournament that happened once a year. After talking it out, and my best friend cracking a few jokes, it had fixed everything. My point is that laughing can release tension, not make everything so serious. Laughing can help you make friends too. Around the world, simple laughter can bring two or more people together. What about enemies? Laughter could possibly show you something you like in that person your not too fond of. Laughter happens to be great for health too, and its a proven fact. What happens when you are really stressed about a test you had recently taken or something different? There are a lot of ways to handle stress, but a really good technique is simply laughter. Try going onto the internet to find something funny that will make you laugh, go hangout with a friend or group of friends, or go and find something else that might have you laugh a little. A famous @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS always gets nervous before one of his shows, and it just so happens that laughter is something he uses to shake off his butterflies. Its quite amazing how laughter can help you in many situations.  Do you ever find yourself feeling down or stressed? Have you had a good laugh recently? Laughing will probably help. If you are having trouble bonding with a friend or simply having a bad day laughter will be a great cure. Laughter is great for your health, and laughter has helped me in my life so far. and whether you realize it or not laughter helps you to. Your laughter can help others too!

12826,21437,8," Laughter is the most important part when you meet other people. Even a light smile can change the image of whole person. Sometimes, people practice their laughter to get better image of themselves. I believe that every people contain their own personality in their laughter. How you laugh is the way to express how you feel. For example, you can tell you are not comfortable by chuckling nervously, or you can tell it wasn't actually funny sarcastically by laughing without any tone or emotions like a robot. You can tell lots of things with a laughter. Usually, friendships are made automatically when two people have something in common and agree with each other. And a laughter is the best way to agree with somebody else. As an @CAPS, I had very hard time expressing my emotions with my laughter. As I know, many @CAPS people don't know that @CAPS can't smile as well as white people because their facial muscles are not very much developed. That's why other people think @CAPS are always angry and doesn't like humor. Thanks to that, I had lots of misunderstandings about my laughter. When I laugh, I don't look like I'm laughing which makes an unnatural laughter. When I first got here, it was in middle of semester and I couldn't speak @CAPS as well as I do now. I had no friends at all. It was a really hard job becoming a friend of someone without knowing what they know, or what their sense of humor is. In @LOCATION, I usually made friends by making them laugh, but in here, I didn't know how to make them laugh. I had to listen to them quietly what they were laughing about, and I had to figure out what kind of sense of humor they had. Finally, when I made one friend, I still couldn't laugh. I didn't understand any of words what they were talking about. I didn't know when to laugh and where to laugh. It seems quite silly when I look back then right now, but I was really serious. I really missed @LOCATION where I had friends I can understand and laugh together. Living without sense of humor made me very depressed. I suddenly stopped laughing at all because I thought laughing alone would look stupid. I kept searching about this country's culture, and I tried to watch television more to learn what they have in their heads. And then, I finally understood those slang words they used and I could laugh when other laughed. I was really happy. I was so happy that I could make other people laugh. I made lots of friends and I laughed with them. But I still couldn't understand some of the language or some other things they laugh about, but I just laughed when they laughed. It made me feel I was one of them when I laughed with them, and I was really happy about it. There was a research about laughter and life, and it said that you live longer when you laugh more. They say that even fake laughter can fool your brain and it can be healthy. Then I saw a doctor who can cure people only by laughter. There are some groups of people who laugh together to be healthy. They gather around and starts laughing. It was really strange when I first saw that group on @CAPS, but I saw people's effort to be healthy. I figured that fake laughter makes everyone happy, and laughter can cover every person's mistake. I also figured that there are still many ways to laugh in this world. By a small laughter, or even a fake laughter, we can make a better society and live a better life.",17,17,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12827,21438,8," Many people love to laugh and others just don't like it as much. I'm one of those people who love laughing and will laugh when my @CAPS tell a very good joke. I believe that it's important to laugh because it just feels good, it makes you feel that everything is going okay. With the people that you can laugh the most with are obviously your @CAPS. When you are feeling down who is there to support you, your @CAPS are, and what they try to do is to make you laugh.       My best friend @PERSON and I have the tendency to always laugh, especially if we have a class together it's all about laughter. We have fun in class, we do pay attention but we just make it interesting and we just laugh so much that it can distract others. Our teacher from sophomore year @PERSON always told us that we're very giggly and that it was a good thing. She also told us that she had never seen anyone laugh so much in her class. For example that year we were studying vocabulary and when @PERSON and I saw the word countenance we started laughing so much because it means the face and it reminded us about the tv show @CAPS. Every time that word came up during that week we would laugh so hard that our stomachs started to hurt. Her face would turn as red as a tomato and I just couldn't even say a word. Even now that we're juniors we still remember that and we just start laughing so hard that it gets to the point that if I'm standing up I will let myself drop to the floor and move my feet as if i was kicking something. Now that's when my @CAPS start laughing more because they say I'm hilarious.      @PERSON and I are the kind of people that if something is very boring to us there has to be a way to make it fun. Some teachers appreciate that we actually have fun in their class but others just don't like it at all. Like last year in @CAPS @CAPS our teacher @PERSON completely freaked out because @PERSON and I were laughing. We were paying attention but we only laughed when we were doing our work but he didn't like it. To us that class was extremely boring and we just made it fun but @PERSON decided to make a sitting chart. Well you would think that by having a sitting chart @PERSON and I wouldn't talk or laugh at all but that didn't happen. That didn't stop her or me from talking to the people around us. We would talk to them and we made class fun. When he thought that we weren't paying attention he would ask us questions and we answered them correctly. Even though @PERSON and I were sitting far away from each other we would move our hands around until we got each others attention and then we just started laughing because we looked funny doing all of that without saying a word.  Every day when my @CAPS and I eat lunch at school at our usual spot we're always laughing. People that don't really know me think I'm crazy or weird but I say that I'm just myself and that I'm very optimistic. @PERSON and I say ""@CAPS sad panda's today"" we say that when we see that one of our @CAPS is quiet or looks sad. The most weirdest thing is that when @PERSON and I laugh at the same time it sounds like one laugh. The first time we realized that we had the same laugh we just started laughing even more that we couldn't even breathe. It's important to laugh because it feels so good and you feel relieved even if you're having a really bad day, like health teachers say it takes more muscles to frown then to smile.",23,23,0.0,46,0.0,0.0,0.0,46.0
12828,21440,8," Laughter is used as a ""cure"" for everything. Through out life, people underestimate the power of laughter. Laughter and joy have always been my personal way of getting to know other people better. I personally use laughter to create a bond that another person and I can relate at a level to be able to share our thoughts and our feelings through laughter. Laughter is very important through life. Laughter can help someone find people that have similar and common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Throughout life, there will always be that one person or that group of people that can enjoy similar things. I have been involved in a lot of social groups. In most of these groups laughter is a common thing between all of these groups. Without this similar interest, Laughter would not exist through life. Laughter helps through every day life. People find these common interests between people and start to create relationships between people that did not exist before. These relationships might be shown through co-workers, through authoritative figures, and friends and family throughout every day life. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" The relationships between people are built from laughter and enjoyment of being with other people. These relationships are formed at a social level with friendly people. Without these relationships, people would never have good times throughout their life. These relationships are created to help introduce the the stories about life. In my life I have had bad times and good times. The bad times that have occurred through my life are when family member have died. My great grandparents on both of my sides of my family have died. Another horrible thing that has happened in my life is that is that one of my friends died at an early age. What happened is that he was riding an all terrain vehicle. But the good things through my life have been breath taking. The one thing that has been breath taking from my life is most of my conversations with my friends. Laughter is the key point in conversation. When I first started my relationship with @PERSON all I could think about was being able to enjoy the times that I have with her. On the first day that we started spending time with each other we could not stop laughing. Everything that either I said or something she did was hilarious to me. The most common thing that we had in common was laughter. At every basketball game we would try and spend as much time as we can together. We try to get to know each other a little bit better by finding common interests through laughing because, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Laughter can help someone find people that have common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Laughter is used in a personal level to become closer to that person. Laughter can be used through every day life.

12829,21441,8," An argument is defined as ""A discussion in which disagreement is expressed."" In many cases, a proverbial ""@CAPS"" is created between the two conflicting parties. Without a way to bridge this gap, the two groups, or individuals, will not come to a settlement, and continue arguing until one or the other backs down and accepts the others point of view. Laughter, can serve as this bridge. The door slammed shut and I went straight to my room. I had returned home from what had started out as a good time with one of my oldest friends. Looking back I do not remember what it was about, all I knew was that I was not going to speak to him ever again; but being as young as I was, these such thoughts rarely last. I would see him every day during the school week, but it would not matter whether he was there or not. He was absent to me as long as we fought. This seemed like a good plan, to completely ignore each other until we had calmed down, but as with any plan, things never go quite as well as you want them to, especially when you are in the same elementary school, and in the same class.  In elementary school, or at least in my case, there were many group activities, and when you are paired with the person whom you are not on the best terms with, things become difficult. Whether it was to build something, write together, or solve a math problem as a group, communication and teamwork are both important, and us fighting did not effect the group well. We would each discuss the best way to go about performing the task at hand with another member of the group with whom we were not fighting with, and then they would discuss and consult each of us separately. In short, it was a mess, and much more difficult than it should have been. Outside the classroom, the fighting persisted. At recess we would not agree to be on the same team, or even be on the same side of the field as one another. After about a week of this, I realized this needed to stop. At recess, I tried to get him to talk out our problem instead of shouting at, or ignoring each other. The calm resolution to the problem started out well, but being children, ended in a shouting match, to which I lost. I began to wonder if we would ever resolve this. When I got home that day, my mother, being a mother and always knowing when something is wrong, asked me what was bothering me. I was resistant at first to explain things, but, being a mother, she talked me into telling her. She started to go on about how I needed to be the mature one and that we needed to calmly talk out our differences, which I had already tried. I began to tune her out and imagined my friends mother giving him the exact same speech. By the time she was done, all I had received from the lecture was that I needed to try again. The next day at recess, I searched for him with the intent of resolving things today, no matter the circumstances. When I found him and attempted to talk things out, it once again turned into a shouting match. Nearby friends started to crowd and we kept at it. Suddenly, in the midst of the yelling, my friend, with whom I had been fighting with for the last few weeks began laughing. I was taken aback and thought about what could possibly have happened for angry shouting to turn into laughter. Looking around I saw nothing out of the ordinary, only a few snickering bystanders. I ran what had just occurred back through my mind. Just as I reached the point where he started laughing I had realized I had inadvertently made a joke while we were yelling at each other. This realization caused me to laugh, and everyone else nearby to laugh. After we stopped laughing, we sat down and talked things out like we should have done from the start. We questioned why we were still fighting over something as unimportant and trivial as this. After about five minutes of talking, we agreed to still be friends and that we would try to talk things out in the future before shouting at each other. When a teacher blew a whistle and recess had ended, I walked back to class feeling happy, and relieved that we had finally worked things out and could continue being friends. If I had not made that joke in the middle of our fight, I am not sure if we would have made up, even in the event we realized how pointless it was. Laughing during an argument will not solve your problems for you. However, laughter can create a bridge across the @CAPS, and provide a common ground in which problems @MONTH be solved.",18,23,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0
12830,21442,8,"                                        Laughter  @CAPS I first meet someone there is always a small wall to climb before we can really get to know eachother: @CAPS laugh. I have this weird awkward nervous laugh, almost like a giggle, that I don't even hear. Others do though. Especially when they first meet me. I think that most times it helps people get to know me faster. But other times, I think it is a hindrance to getting to know me.  When someone first meets me they usually always comment on @CAPS laugh. They either seem slightly thrown off by it, or they easily open up and joke around with me. They always tell me about it: @CAPS odd it is, @CAPS much I do it, what it's like, etc. As if I've never been told about it before. But, this is fine. I don't hear it come out and I don't mind being told. I don't really think of it as a bad thing. When they seem thrown off by @CAPS laughing, I get more awkward and try to control it, but usually end up doing it even more. If it seems to make them laugh and they don't make fun of me for it, I just let it come out, and it becomes very easy to get to know that person. I never really realized just @CAPS bad it was, until one weekend at the beach. I was on a beach retreat with @CAPS youth group, and one of the activities was a video scavenger hunt. We went around town and took videos of different things, actions, situations, and people. One of these things we had to get a video of was one of us playing rock paper scissors with a stranger. So I promptly went up to two older women and asked to play a game with them. When we all watched the videos later I saw and heard just @CAPS weird @CAPS voice, laugh, and mannerisms are with strangers. People had told me about them from time to time, but I'd never seen it. It was weird! Another situation was working at @LOCATION this @DATE. When we did icebreaker games to break tension and meet the people on our teams more easily. Everyone on @CAPS team seemed slightly weirded out by me. I couldn't figure out why, until one person would just step up and be straightforward: and inform me of @CAPS laugh. As the first week went by though, I was the person that knew everyone on the team the best. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It can be bridged quickly, or made greater: depending on @CAPS people react to it. If they join in it together, the distance is destroyed. When, however, one person doesn't join into the laughter, or doesn't enjoy the other person's laugh, this distance is greatly increased. It becomes hard to breach this distance, and the chance to do so is probably lost. And that is just too bad. We should all be able to laugh together and share in eachother's joy.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12831,21443,8," Every time I walk down the hall and I see a couple, they are either laughing with each other or doing other things that could disqualify my test. I know for a fact that the people that get voted cutest couple at our school are the ones that are laughing as opposed to the later. Not only does laughing create couples, then families, and eventually the next generation, but it creates friendships within schools, families, activites, etc. That's why personally I believe that laughing is the single most powerful action a person can do. Every person I am friends with have laughed with me and vice-versa. Especially one friend who I've gotten even closer since we met. I was very adament about going to church when I was young. I have always been shy and church allows me to be social with others without reticule. However I saw one girl sitting in the back corner who I felt was scared just like I probably would have been if it was anywhere else. My parents always wanted me to be more social and they said that one way to do that was to go out of my way to meet new people.  I did that for maybe the first time in my life to say ""hi"" to her. She replied by giving me her name. However I went back into my shy self and walked back terrified to talk to her or any one else again. However, I was only in third grade when all this happened so as time passed by things changed. About @NUM years after that a new church opened with a new class being open to children of all age groups. I had cemented myself into that classroom as one of two who regularly showed up. However this one day I was the only one who was there for my age group. Well actually I was the only one from my age group that was there on time. I saw a girl walking in with her dad who you could tell had forced her to go to the class. It took me a while to picture who it was but eventually I realized who it was. It was the girl who was scared to be in church and now she was the girl who was scared to be in class. She could clearly recognize me. I made a hand gesture telling her to come in. then you saw her smile. She shortly proceded to laughing a little bit. This was when I realized I met someone special. Now everytime I see her she smiles. That's how I know she will be a friend for a long time. Laughing can't be put into quotes, but it can be put into someone's memories for the rest of your life. I know this for a fact cause a lot of days have passed since and I still have these memories. Laughing is the easiest way to tell if a person is a true friend, something more, or should and will be forgotten.",17,25,34.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0

The janitor was wiping the floor with water. the kid was not payingany attention at all to the janitor. The janitor was also a mean person, he was mad at the boy for stealing stuff from the school janitor's closet. The boy was also mad because the janitor was mean to him I was in @NUM grade and I didn't know any better. I had to say that I was sorry because the teacher caught meand my friend laughing,and told me the boy was not mentally well or stable. I felt bad, and apologized right away. I told the kid that I didn't mean anything by it, that it was just a reaction.The boy was able to laugh at himself and he and I became friends.

12834,21447,8," A time laughter has been in one of my relationships, was when I was down in the dumps and my cousin made me smile. It was a rainy @DATE @TIME and I just woke up, my dad had asked me to make him some of breakfast; while I was making the hash browns, eggs, and toast I thought of how little me and my dad spend together, and how unsteady and rocky our father-daughter relationship was and I thought of things we could do together. When I brought his breakfast up to him I proposed the idea of going to the movies, he said he would think about it and told me to go get started on my chores. When I was finally done I got on facebook and talked to my cousin @CAPS; I told him how excited I was to go with my dad to the movies and how we were finally spending more time together.By the time it reached five o'clock in the afternoon, I went back upstairs to talk to my dad. I asked him what time we would be leaving, he said around eight and that is when I got the feeling we were not going to go after all. I walked out of his room and strolled down the stairs only to find myself swelling up with tears; I curled up in my @CAPS-boy chair in the living room and waited for eight to be come. The time it came I was full of disappointment, and my father said we would go the next day but he was going to bring a friend. Because his friend was going to see his daughter (and also my friend since the age of three) at her gymnastics's meet, I didn't have a problem with seeing the meet or her. I did have a problem though with someone else coming with my dad and I to the movies. Though I wanted to spend quality time with him; it made me upset that my dad didn't want to spend quality time with me, we hardly even talked and that is hard to do when you live under the same roof.I went back down stairs and climbed back in my chair and cried, and decided that it must have been my fault,and that I did something wrong. So i got up and talked to someone I know could help me out of the dumps. He is one of the only people who I absolutely love talking to, and someone who knows me very well. It is my cousin, we have a very strong relationship that has almost nothing but laughter in it. At first he tried reassuring me but it didn't work, so he did something he knows best he made me laugh by doing or saying silly random things; he even said he would eat my poor little kitty if I didn't smile for him. That is when I started giggling and he kept going to keep me laughing, until the only tears I was crying from trying to breathe. He always has been the one who can always turn my frown upside down. And I can do the same for him, he @MONTH be my cousin but he's also my best friend and that makes me feel the love I need from my family that only he can give me, and I hope I will never ever forget or lose that with him.Before I became friends with @CAPS I never thought I could have someone I could really talk to about my home life. He understands me and what I've been through and knows me as well as I know him and I enjoy that. I could have never have asked for anything better. He's my favorite cousin and the best out of my best friends, who loves talking to me and making me laugh until I'm trying to breathe for air. I will never forget what he's done for me, but this stands out more then every other time and I thank him for that. That is how and why laughter has and is a important part in all and in every relationship to and for everyone.",17,19,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12835,21448,8, A time when laughter was one element or part was when my brother showed a youtube video to my family. The video was about a guy who was talking about his childhood when his dad told him to go to the store to get bread to make sandwiches for dinner and was told to not to get into any trouble. To avoid getting into trouble his dad told him to go across the street because there was three boys down the block that looked like trouble. So he did what his dad told him to do and he went across the street but when he was passing the boys they stopped him. One of the boys yelled out something and a bunch of their friends came flying from a that was barbershop across the street and surrounded him. He managed to get free and ran as fast as he could. He said that he was running so fast that he knew that he passed a @ORGANIZATION because he said he was behind it and then was in front of the car running to get to his house. When he got to his house he told his dad that he did what he told. The dad was only worried about is if he got the bread and the guy was upset that his dad was worried about bread instead of him. The way the guy told his childhood memory was funny and even though I was already shown the video by brother the night before we both still thought it was funny and so did my family and we would burst out laughing at times.,15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0

This was the nickname he called him because he was only two years old, so my friend spencer calmed him down and we started watching t.v. We were talking about what we were going to do for the day so, we started throwing out ideas till we made one where we were going to swim later and play some games now. Spencers mom asked us when we were going to swim and that we had to take his little borther. So we went early so his little bro could swim and we could sit around and listen to music. Unlike everyone who uses an ipod I use my phone because then I can text and listen to music plus when someone calls it shuts off music so I'll know. It was a brand new phone too and i was loving every moment of having it. So when we dropped his little brother off we went back too the pool and sat in the hot tub for a while. I put my phone on my shirt and my towl over both so when spencer got out too use the towl he jerked the towl out and my phone flew up hit the ground slid on the floor all the way too the hot tub. That moment I look down and see it and freak I took it out ripped the back off and dried the battery with the towl hoping it would still work and it wouldn't stop dialing zero and nine so I took the battery out again. When we got back to his moms i plugged in the charger with no battery and spencer kept saying sorry and I kept answering ""its ok"". The next morning his mom asked why we didn't use a pot of rice and we started laughing because we freaked out so bad over a phone.

12837,21450,8,"@DATE what a night!! Me and my friends we were going to a @CAPS party at our dance coaches work. we had to dress up as elves and play with kids. It was fun, but after we were done with the party that's when the real fun began! After we changed out of our costumes and back into our regular clothes we started taking pictures. @CAPS were funny ones,cute one, and weird ones,all kinds of pictures. Anyways my friends and i didn't want to go home just yet so we decided that we should go to some places to take more pictures and have more fun! First stop was a school play ground but we couldn't stay because it was late and we weren't allowed inside so we decided to go to the discovery park i was driving and one of my friends in the passenger seat was taking pictures that turned out really funny. so when we got to the park my friend that was taking the pictures said  @CAPS i drive around the parking lot?"" I said sure. we switched spots and off we went. She was a pretty good driver, but @CAPS was some scary moments that i felt we were going to die. ha ha. So she drove around and then went to the stop sign by a main road where she decided it would be a good time to switch back and i was yelling at her ""@CAPS's a car coming we @CAPS get in trouble"", but no she didn't listen to me she got out so then i had to get out and we were yelling at each other and my friends in the back seat were yelling also not because we were mad but we didn't want to get caught and we were having a lot of fun. so i get back in the driver seat and we are all yelling "" get in the car"" but she laughing really hard saying "" I wet my pants."" we all started laughing because we thought she was kidding but oh no she was serious she was laughing so hard that she actually wet her pants! It was a good thing she had extra pants with her. So i had to back up the car so she could change behind this big metal thing. As she was changing we thought it would be really funny if we got a picture of her changing so i got the camera and stuck it out the window, but it was really dark even with the flash on so the picture didn't come out! she was laughing so hard that we teased her saying "" keep it in"". We still tease her a lot about it even though it's been two months. When ever we are laughing really hard and someone says "" oh i think I'm gonna pee my pants"" we look at @PERSON and say "" @PERSON knows what that's like"" we have too much fun teasing her about things she's done.  the next day we go and tell the rest of our friends that weren't with us what happened and they all started laughing as hard as we did. At the time she wasn't in the room with us when we told the rest of our friends, but when she walked in and we all stopped and saw her it was really hard to keep from laughing. now everyone knows about that night and @PERSON's "" accident"". every now and then we make fun of her but she laughs along because we all know it could have been anyone of us.

12838,21451,8," A @CAPS @CAPS  For me laughter is a huge part of life. I cannot, nor wish to escape it. @CAPS is fun in itself. It always makes tense situations become relaxed and enjoyable. No feeling is more perfect than falling head first into uncontrollable laughter. @CAPS is the best way to unite people together and form memories and bonds. In my home and family, too many situations arise that cause the potential, and often result, of laughter. It is the same way with my distant families such as my friends at school. Life growing up with a brother, wonderfully fun neighbors, and cousins have produced most of my @CAPS memories. One such time, in which laughter flowed freely, happened rather recently. The situation began when my brother, @PERSON, had to do a school assignment. @PERSON was assigned, by his history teacher, to write a diary entry as if he were a mountain man in the @DATE's. I did not set out to help him with his homework, but considering the end result, I was thoroughly glad I did. It seemed so unlikely that this task would be so fun. I guess that just shows how laughter can crop up so suddenly and in such unpredictable places. I came into @PERSON's room and he told me what he was working on, so I leaned over his shoulder and helped him with a few ideas. We were making progress and once reaching a certain point, we both contributed to a subtle humorous comment we decided to add to the entry. Reading our creation, nothing less than an explosion of laughter was triggered. The noise poured out of @PERSON's room like lava from a volcano! My parents could hear us and likely thought we were crazy! Another person reading our literature might not have laughed at all, but to us it was hilarious. Being in a good mood, and considering @PERSON's history teacher said to make the entries creative, more humorous and quite witty sentences were added. By this time I was doubled over struggling to speak through all the @CAPS I was consumed by. @PERSON was hardly better. Homework had @CAPS been more fun. We finished quicker than if @PERSON was working by himself and came away with the greatest feeling. @PERSON ended up getting full points on the entry when he turned it into his teacher.  This is just one example of thousands I could think of in which laughter @CAPS the moment. This particular instance helped with work and yet @CAPS the work not a chore, but rather a tremendously happy event. Perhaps more laughter in the workplace would lead to better production. All things considered, laughter, in my opinion, makes for the greatest @CAPS.",20,25,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12839,21452,8," I believe laughter is an important part of any relationship. In all my relationships whether it be friends,family,or a girlfriend laughter is always an important element of all of them.  the best relationship i have is with my best friend @PERSON and it is filled with laughter. We always have a great time together, like last @DATE when she and I went to snow peak with some friends and I tore ligaments in my knee when I jumped @PERSON's quad. We laughed about me being stupid and getting hurt for it and we laughed about @CAPS big ears and how they make him look like @CAPS the elephant.  I think what makes us so close and such good friends is how much we make each other laugh. The first time we met she was dating one of my friends and the first thing I did was make her laugh and ever since then we have been awesome friends. Then she asked me if I wanted to work at the harvest fest, with her and I did and a made her laugh the whole time. Now I'm her dork and she is my best friend. The biggest thing I did to make her laugh at the harvest fest, was when I did a wheelie in the tractor down the whole track with a cowboy hat on and a huge dip of @LOCATION in my lip.

But @PERSON, who is six foot, has short brown hair, dark ocher colored eyes, chose to stand about @DATE paces in front of us.  To any person strolling by, he would have looked @CAPS if he was just enjoying the amazing view of the crystal water, but to us, who knew him all too well, knew he was thinking about his brother, @PERSON, who was in the hospital. @PERSON had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, got in the middle of a homeless persons fight, not to mention the guy was drunk, and got stabbed with a rusty switch-blade. @PERSON felt like it was his fault that this had happened, and this made him so depressed that he would not @CAPS at any of our idiocy, or even eat for that matter. @PERSON's feeling that way made @LOCATION and I feel completely horrible and there was nothing we could do to cheer him up. @PERSON was usually the most exuberant out of all of us, and we did every single thing we could possibly so to make him feel better, or, at the very least, get him to @CAPS again. But not once could we budge him, or even get one little giggle out of his tightened jaw. Not one of our pathetic attempts even touched his eyes, but we never gave up, in fact, we tried for days on end to get him to smile again. We got to the point of desperation that we even dressed ourselves up @CAPS teletubies, went to @PERSON's house, dragged him off of his couch, and took him downtown. Yet not one second of it did his mouth even twitch upwards.  Although we did some of the most outrageous, unimaginably embarrassing things we could possibly think of, and trust me, we though about it for days. We got absolutely no response what so ever out of him, except, of course, his enormous yawns.  Finally, about @DATE, we got him to giggle, which eventually turned into a full on, body shaking @CAPS. You will never guess what finally got him to crack. @CAPS-@CAPS joke. Of all the horrendously obnoxious deeds we had done, cheesy, idiotic @CAPS-@CAPS jokes are what got to him. Although @LOCATION and I felt like complete idiots, we could not help but @CAPS with him. After that day it was no longer a difficult process for him. @PERSON was almost, but not quite, back to his normal self.

When I was about @NUM years of age I had my first memory. My dad, @PERSON, my brothers and I were all at a pond over in @LOCATION. We were racing @CAPS boats that my dad had build. We would go there every other @DATE after school, from the moment I get out of school till it is so dark outside you can'@CAPS see you hand right in front of your face. One particular time I remember going, was the time my brother decided I need to go for a swim. My brothers and I got along but were never really close to one another. @CAPS loved pulling pranks on me, being that I was the youngest. So I was standing next to my dad and brother, there was a whole bunch of small ferns around us. My brother @PERSON jumped out of one of the bushes behind me and it made me jump. Meanwhile my brother @PERSON was on his hands and knees waiting for be to jump so he can make me trip over him. Well I did, there was a drop off at the edge of the pond that no one really noticed and I went tumbling down the hill. My elbow ran into stomach and my head hit a rock, then a @CAPS! I was now soaked laying there a gooey green monster. At the moment no one was laughing but later on we did. The rest of that night no one really talked. The sun was just starting to set and I was sitting on the tail of a truck covered with blankets as my dad, brothers and @PERSON stood in the setting sun. I will never forget that loomenesint sight. As years pasted things gradually got worse between my brothers and myself. Things weren'@CAPS quit as easy. There wasn'@CAPS a forgive and forget. My brother @PERSON is five years older than me. He has @CAPS and serious relationship problems. One day he decided he was going to take out his problems on me. I was about @NUM years old. I loved my brothers and I didn'@CAPS know his ulterior motive at the time. My whole family except my dad was watching @CAPS.V. in the living room. My brother @PERSON went back to his room and put spider man into his mini @CAPS player and climbed up the ladder into his bed. It was a titanium bed with a desk on the bottom, the top bunk was nearly kissing the sealing. He came out of his room and went into the kitchen and filled up his water bottle. As he filled his bottle up he asked if anyone wanted to watch spider man. Being my mother was watching the news I took him up on his offer. We both climbed up into the top bunk and watched the movie. We watched it for a little. I was cold so he offered me a blankets I got him last @CAPS. It was fuzzy thick and warm with a huge tiger on it. Like most boys he slept in boxers and that was kinda weird seeing him walk around in them. But I never said anything. As we laid there he stuck his hand into my pants. I pushed him away and continued to watch the movie. He tried it several more times but I wouldn'@CAPS let him. I didn'@CAPS think it was right. But then he pinned my down with his leg across mine. I didn'@CAPS scream. He started to wiggle his finger around in my pants, it stung. I told him deliberately to stop, he didn'@CAPS. Then he grabbed a pencil from behind him and stuck it in my vagina. Seconds later my dad walked in and said it was bed time. My brother threw himself back and I went soaring out of his room. That night was the first time my dad didn'@CAPS read me a bedtime story.  A few months later my brother @PERSON started acting weird too. He was always jittery around me and was never relaxed. One day he went out and bought a whole bunch of my favorite candy. Those @CAPS ""@CAPS @ORGANIZATION's."" @CAPS look like a @ORGANIZATION that was white and crunchy on the outside and the inside is full of chocolate. He would bribe me with these, saying, ""I will give you one box of @CAPS @ORGANIZATION's if you let me touch you in three places of my choice."" I didn'@CAPS know it was wrong. I just wanted the candy, so I let him. This interaction went on for about a year. He never did anything to invasive. After all this stuff happened I really didn'@CAPS know what to do with myself. Once I knew it was wrong I cried but that didn'@CAPS help. So I tried laughing and it worked.

I kept going into the ice cold air. I slowly began to realized they had stopped and I tried to come to an immediate halt. They all began to laugh as i laid on the icy growned holding @CAPS soar butt. I was so embarrassed, and so shocked by @CAPS had just happened that i didn't move, I just laid back and closed @CAPS eyes. As I was laying there I began hearing foot steps. I figured they were just @CAPS friends coming to help me. But when i opened @CAPS eyes, it wasn't @CAPS friends I saw. It was a hansom man, one I had seen few times before in @CAPS high school. @CAPS leans down and ask me, ""@CAPS you okay?"" I reply in a shy tone,""yes..."" @CAPS smiles and reaches down to help me up. As our skin gently touches I get butterfly's all through out @CAPS body. I look at him and @CAPS tell @CAPS was getting the same feeling. As i stand to @CAPS feet we both smile and begin to laugh. I still to this day don't understand why we laughed... I am wondering a million things at once, but the first question that exits @CAPS mouth is, ""@CAPS is your name?""@CAPS reply's with a smile and says, "" @CAPS and you?""""@CAPS name is @CAPS."" I reply.I begin to thank him and ask if @CAPS would like some hot chocolate or coffee. @CAPS reply's in a cute tone that sent chills up @CAPS spine. @CAPS says ""I would rather take you to get a burger, will you come?""A huge smile washes over @CAPS face as i say ""yes."" @CAPS grabs @CAPS hand and walks me closer to @CAPS friends. They all began to smile and turn and walk away quickly into the depths of @CAPS house. @CAPS smiles and decides not to follow. We both begin to laugh as we run over to his car.

The first thought that went streaming through @CAPS head was, I cant believe @CAPS wants to take me out to lunch!  We sit awkwardly in the car all the way to a small dinner called @ORGANIZATION. When we stop @CAPS jumps out of the car and rushes to @CAPS door to open it. @CAPS is such a gentle men i thought to myself. When we get to our table @CAPS orders for us both and asks me all sorts of questions. @CAPS kept me smiling the hole time! I don't think any boy has ever done that. After we ate and @CAPS drove me home we smiled and laughed as @CAPS told me joke after joke. When we reach @CAPS house @CAPS asks me a question. A question i will never forget. ""@CAPS i kiss you?"" @CAPS asks. I do not answer but lean in and kiss him. We look into each others eyes after wards and begin to laugh.. Why we laughed i still will never know. But at that moment i fell in love. At that moment i realized laughter will be the connection between us forever. The laughter is in remembrance of him. @MONTH @CAPS rest in peace...

First is @CAPS mom. (@LOCATION) @CAPS mom is the one that showed me, laughing is the key to almost everything. She showed me it's okay to fall down. Laugh at the fact you're silly, you messed up but make sure to get back up. @CAPS mom can make me laugh no matter what is going on in @CAPS teenage ""drama"" life. The biggest thing I've learned is when I'm emotionally broken, when I feel the whole world is against me and I just don't want to be me anymore to laugh through it. When me and @CAPS best friend got into a fight @TIME @DATE I didn't come out of @CAPS house for about a week and a half, I didn't want to talk to any of @CAPS friends. @CAPS mom tried to get me to call her but I never did, till one day @CAPS mom sat down on @CAPS bed and said ""@CAPS it's not want happens to you it's what you do with it, do you hear me laughing all the time, when I'm upset, sad and happy...that's what I want you to do no matter what is going on in your ""drama"" teenage life don't shrug it off @CAPS laugh it off, call her.""@CAPS @CAPS friends definitely take second place. Like @CAPS friends, I also have @CAPS. When I'm with them nothing else phases me, the whole world could be ending and I wouldn't notice a thing. I feel since I have @CAPS I speak a different language that most people can't understand besides @CAPS friends with @CAPS. @CAPS friends are very random and have a lot of energy. One thing that they taught me is having @CAPS is a gift and a curse. When @PERSON and I are hanging out it doesn't matter who we're around we make there day, we can't help feeling goofy plus the non-stop laughing. Sometimes it gets us into things like people our age think we're laughing at them when we're really not.Third place is me. I make myself laugh more than anyone or anything. I'm a total comedian. When I try to be funny I'm not that funny but when I don't try I make people laugh so hard they cry. @CAPS whole life I've been told ""@CAPS, wow you really are something no matter what mood someone's in you just make life seem so amazing."" @CAPS people laugh is one thing but @CAPS myself laugh is very different. When I was sitting on the floor in @CAPS room @TIME I was thinking about @CAPS past life and became pretty upset but to pull myself out of the negative thinking I started thinking about the good times I've and within five minutes I was laughing so hard @CAPS stomach hurt.     Like I said ""like all great things"" laughter is @CAPS greatest. Laughing really can open someones eyes. I will continue to live laughing and eventually pass it down when the time comes.

12844,21458,8,"In any relationship, things like physical contact, verbal conversations, or any kind of outward expression at all is very important. More particularly, laughing is key as well, to any kind of iteracton with someone. Laughing says,""what you are saying is funny"" or, I'm enjoying this"". Laughing says a lot without saying a word. Think about someone you know very well. It might be your best friend, or it might be a family member. If you think about it, you can tell when they are mad, sad, angry, frustrated, just by looking at their facial expressions or looking into their eyes. When you see them laugh, you see happiness. Its so obvious, because their eyes sparkle, their face lights up, and you just know that they are cheery. Now think about when you are hanging out with your friends. Being with friends is always fun, and we love it. That's why we go do things with them right? And when we are with them, we laugh a lot. We tell funny stories, we share inside jokes, and fun memories that make us laugh, and we love that, we love the feeling we get when we are with them,and most of all, we love the moments that make us laugh. Maybe its a long car ride, a sleepover, or maybe its at a party or church perhaps. Have you ever noticed that when one person laughs, the rest of the group follows in unison? Laughter is contagious, making it hard to resist most of the time. Whether it be a joke that was told, or that someone made a fool of themselves, its always a favorite part of any gathering or party, or whatever it @MONTH be. Some people say that each time you laugh, a few seconds are added to your life. Im not so sure I believe that, but I do believe laughing is healthy. I know that when I laugh, i feel so much better. Whenever I get back from hanging out with my three closest friends, I feel great. It's like whatever else that was getting to me that week or day is just forgotten, and especially if we laugh a lot, it makes me feel good. When a friend or someone else we know is down in the dumps,what is the first thing most of us resort to? It's going to be making them laugh right? Because laughter is a big part of being happy. When someone laughs, they find it hard to resist being cheered up. For this reason, I believe that laughter is the best medicine of all. It's so hard not to feel better when laughing. Once again, I believe that laughter is important in any human relationship, because laughing shows that you are either enjoying their company, just like smiling at all the right moments, or making the right face when they are telling a story, and showing them that you are engaged in the conversation. If someone is telling a funny story, or a joke, laughing shows that you get the humor in what they are saying. If you are enjoying being with that person, laugh a lot. Show them that you love hanging out with them. People love making other people laugh. Whether you are laughing at a joke, a funny story, or a face they made, or all of the above, laughing is just as important in any situation. Just like the saying goes for smiling, everyone laughs in the same language. Laughter says the same thing all around the world. Laughter is is almost always a good sign, and means something is going right.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12845,21459,8,"             The @CAPS of Laughter Laughter can be used in many different ways, you could either laugh because something is funny, to be rude, or just because you enjoy what people are doing and @CAPS brings a smile to your face. Sometimes we shouldn't laugh at other people because @CAPS could hurt them even more then we imagine, and @CAPS could even affect their life @CAPS they grow older. When I was younger I faced a situation which affected me @CAPS I grew up. I have always enjoyed singing ever since I could remember, but up to one point I couldn't bare to sing in front of a crowd or even my family.  I was about four years old. @CAPS was a dark @DATE @TIME, my family decided that we were going to go out to have some fun at a place called @ORGANIZATION. This @ORGANIZATION was where family and friends could get together to have a great time, there would be a band playing, bright round colorful tables to sit at, drinks, and @CAPS had a game room for the children to play at. My cousin's and their band were going to playing that @TIME. My family and I got all dressed up, I wore a beautiful white dress that my mother had chose for me to wear. I looked like a star in my own eyes and I was satisfied. When we arrived my family and I sat at a bright, lime green, glow in the dark, round table and watched the performance.  I danced with my parents for a long time and then I would play games with my brother and friends. My cousin who is the lead singer of the band was calling out in the microphone if anyone would like to sing a @CAPS to the crowd. I ran to my parents and told them that this was my chance to shine and that I wanted to do @CAPS. They smiled at me and said ""yes sweetheart, of course you can do @CAPS!"" @CAPS I ran up to where my cousin was standing, I pushed through the bundle of children so that I could be in the front. I looked up smiled, and raised my hand at my cousin shouting for her to chose me. My cousin smiled back and picked me up and placed me on the speaker! I was so delighted, I couldn't even breath. @CAPS was my biggest dream to stand up here with a microphone in my hand. @CAPS I stood on the big speaker box, I looked at the crowd of people and took a deep breath and I began to sing. I was singing my most favorite @CAPS that I knew by memory. The crowd smiled and clapped, but @CAPS soon @CAPS I sang the chorus of the @CAPS everyone started to laugh. I didn't know why they were laughing. Was @CAPS because I accidentally forgot to take my gum out of my mouth? Because I did happen to forget. Or was @CAPS because I sounded really bad? I was so scared, the gum that I was chewing in my mouth started to harden and my voice grew faint. I began to panic, my eyes started to become watery. I noticed tears coming down all over my face. I couldn't even bare being up in front of all these people if they were going to laugh at me. So I jumped off the speaker, ran to my mother, and began to cry in her lap. I cried for a long hour, my family tried telling me that everything was fine and that I did a magnificent job, but @CAPS wasn't enough for me to believe @CAPS. Over the years I always detested singing in front of people. @CAPS scared me just having the thought of maybe someone would burst out laughing because I was either bad, or off key. After that I always began to tell myself that I had a horrible voice and I knew @CAPS was the reason why the crowd at the @ORGANIZATION laughed at me. Every time my parents would ask me to sing a @CAPS I would tell them ""no thank you, I don't like to sing anymore."" @CAPS wasn't true at all, I lied about @CAPS to my own parents, but I still had that horrible feeling in my heart and soul. Now that I am older I understand why I was so terrified, and the reason why the people laughed wasn't at all what I thought @CAPS was. My parents told me that @CAPS was because the people thought that I was adorable, and since I was young I couldn't really pronounce some words right. I giggled at @CAPS, and now I just keep telling myself that I can sing because nothing else is going to bring me down, and I am trying to stay positive about @CAPS. @CAPS's still very hard for me to sing a solo, but after a certain period of time I will have the strength and courage to sing to anyone.

It was one of the best trips that my father ever took me on i liked it a lot. One of the funniest memories that i do remember is when we were driving throught the desert and there was this paper in the air and i did not know what it was so i was like, ""dad what is that""? and he says ""that is a falling star"" i was like ""in the middle of the day""? and it took me till about a couple years to figure out what it really was but now i know what it was and i just look back to that day and laugh.",15,17,0.0,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.0
12847,21462,8," There was a memory of mine that was full of laughter and fun. Then it also turned into a serious and none joking around madder. It all started on a @DATE @TIME, my brother @ORGANIZATION called me and told me to come come over I hadn't been over at my moms house in a while. I replied yeah sure man ill be over in a hour. I jumped in my truck and headed to my mothers house.While on the way I stopped to get some gas at the gas station. Fifteenth minutes later I arrived at my moms house. once arrived my brother was out side waiting for me. @ORGANIZATION came up to the truck and helped me with my bag and the door. Once I was in the house I walked over to the kitchen saw my @CAPS, and gave her a hug, and asked her how she was doing? She replied, I'm alright hunny, then asked me what was new, with myself? I said nothing much @CAPS, hanging out trying to stay out of trouble. I asked her is there anything she needed me to do? Or needs to be done? My om named off a couple things that needed to be done around the house. After she was done telling me some of the things i headed to my room to change into my work cloths, then headed out side. I grabbed my brother on the way because he was going to help me out. While we were down at the garage @ORGANIZATION brings up the fact that I haven't been there in a while he said party tonight. I replied ok. While I was done working on the garage, my dad came down and said the fence needs to be fixed, so we moved the tractor over and fixed the fence. Its was @NUM at night already people were already showing up.  When we got to the house my @CAPS comes out and says, what you guys doing out here? Get in the party already, it's a full house there were @NUM people in my moms house that night. Drinking and just having a good time. When i walked up to the living room i noticed the girls were making food for the guys while the guys were playing drinking games. There were a couple games going on, for example there was beer pong, shots, and beer bong. There was always someone that wanted to beat the drinking record in the house, to be the best drinker. The drinking record in the house for one night of drinking was @NUM shots and @NUM beers. To this day the record still stands and the person who holds the record is me. I look over at shots and a friend of my @CAPS said i wanna challenge you. I said ok. It did not end up well @NUM shots, and the guy that was against me was passed out on the table.  Hours later everyone was sleeping but me, my brother and one of our friends. We were out side chewing while @ORGANIZATION was peeing on his dads car. All of the sudden I look over and @ORGANIZATION is puking all over on the ground. I laughed so hard i feel over because the look on his face while smiling when he was throwing up. My friend @PERSON and I took @ORGANIZATION down stairs to his bed put him to sleep and went back up stairs, to lay down. Before we when it the door opened and it's @ORGANIZATION he wanted to say he loves us and good night. We replied thanks bro same to you. Less that thirty seconds later We heard oh crap and a loud noise falling down the stairs, it was @ORGANIZATION. The next @TIME I woke up and I did not feel so good, I told my @CAPS about it. She said ok well ill make you some food. So she did I did not feel better so I just went home to sleep. I opened my door I saw my @CAPS at my house and said, @TIME @CAPS. She replied you drank? I said yes, and i don't feel so good. she said ok well ill take you to the doctor if it does not get better. A month went by of me not eating right or drinking, so i went to the doctor and they told me i messed up my liver so bad I had the liver of a @NUM year old, all i remember was crying and saying to my @CAPS never again. I realized drinking and having fun is all ok until someone gets hurt. The doctor told me if i was to drink again I could die, I made the best choice of my life there i believe. To this day I have not drank any alcohol at all it has been a year and @NUM days.

If @CAPS @CAPS the kind of person that can laugh about any and everything, then I'm sure we would get along well. Laughter plays a key part in my life. @CAPS is a part in about three different ways, in that I joke around a lot about numerous things, I do funny things such as make funny faces, and last I also laugh about me being a klutz. When @CAPS see me or talk to me for either a short amount of time or an abundant amount of time I guarantee I can and will make @CAPS laugh. Laughter can be an amazing thing, when in any kind of situation as in an awkward one, an embarrassing time, or just any kind of situation when @CAPS don't know what @CAPS should do; just remember @CAPS can laugh in those times. Ever since I was just a young girl no matter where or what I was doing I always seemed to be a huge klutz. My mom would always say, "" @CAPS @CAPS worse then a bull in a @LOCATION shop."" @CAPS was so right. If @CAPS was just as simple as me dropping things, maybe even breaking glass, or falling; that statement was always true. All @CAPS could ever do when I did do something like that was just laugh, because @CAPS knew that @CAPS has a clumsy daughter.  Such as this one time when I was in elementary school, we had award assemblies every month, these were to recognize students who had been doing well that month and was following the rules of a certain characteristic. This was the day I had hoped for; my name to get called. When the teachers were up on the stage calling names, I was anticipating for @CAPS to be my turn. Then next up my name was called. I got up and was so excited and nervous to go in front of the crowd and get my award. When I had gotten up there I got my award then went back down the stairs. Not a great idea when I was so excited. When I was going down, I literally went down the stairs. My feet had missed a stair, and I went flying down on my behind. Now tell me what would @CAPS do in this situation? In front of over two-hundred kids and about thirty parents? Well I just had to laugh @CAPS @CAPS, get up, and go back to my seat. Another thing about laughter @CAPS really makes me who I am to this day. I don't know where or what I would be doing if @CAPS weren't for me lacking dexterity when I was younger. Laughter has brought me closer to my family and friends. They know when I am looking gloomy; that if they want me to not look so gloomy that they will have to make me laugh. My closest friends and I joke around and laugh about numerous things. Sometimes @CAPS might be facetious, so we have to catch ourselves on those ones. From my experience of being clumsy no matter the situation, I learned that instead of being embarrassed and not wanting to bring up what happened ever again, that making @CAPS funny, and something @CAPS can laugh about is much better. Learning from a young age to laugh and have fun, @CAPS really has made me a better person; in that people know me me for many different things, but one of them is that I am a happy and funny girl and laugh a lot.That is something that I am proud of, just knowing that I can make my peers and other adults laugh and have good time. So therefore laughter is not just one element or part in my life, @CAPS plays a huge part.",18,18,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0

I had woken up on time, eaten a good breakfast, and I didn't even miss the school bus. My first few classes were fabulous and I was about to go to lunch. As the bell rang I hurried to the cafeteria to get a good spot in line. One of my close friends had called my name so I turned to wave and when I turned back I ran directly into @LOCATION. We hit hard. I flew backwards dropping everything I was carrying. I tried to say I was sorry but all she did was glare at me and walk away. As I picked up my books I realized I didn't want anything to do with that girl and decided I'd just forget about what had just happened.   After lunch I had @CAPS. I was extra excited for this class because the boy of my dreams, @PERSON, was in it. On my way there I made a quick pit-stop to the ladies room to make sure I still looked decent and then headed to class. As I walked in the room the first thing I saw was @PERSON's beautiful blond hair and his dazzling blue eye. Then I registered the whole scene. Guess who was twirling her hair and batting her eye lashes at my dream guy! You got it, @LOCATION. From that moment on it was war! As the year progressed @LOCATION and I constantly strove to out do each other. We'd race each other to class to see who would get to sit behind @PERSON. She always had to have the best hair. I would get a cute new hair cut and she would get high lights. I received a phone. So she went out and bought the latest and greatest phone with the built in music player. I remember getting to class early one day, so excited to show @PERSON this new game I'd learned. But of course when I walked in the room @LOCATION was already showing him the exact same game. There was one thing I always had over @LOCATION, books. Both @PERSON and I loved books. We would sit and talk about the latest and greatest books for hours. This always made @LOCATION jealous. Our childish behavior went on like this for three or four months. One day at lunch I was just sitting, eating my food, and minding my own business. All of the sudden @LOCATION appeared out of nowhere and spit soda at my face. That did it. This was the last straw. I grabbed my milk carton and dumped it on her head. The cafeteria went silent for about a minute. @LOCATION and I stood there glaring at each other, rage searing from our eyes until some one broke the silence with a loud laugh. Soon everyone was laughing, including @LOCATION and I. We realized just how stupid we'd been acting and for the first time we were laughing together not at each other. We both apologized and helped each other get cleaned up.  Eventually we became really good friends. To this day we still laugh about or @NUM grade rivalry.",25,20,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0

Ofcourse we got older as the years went by, but we had soo many great times together. When ever we hung out, we would always laugh about almost everything, and most of the time we would just never let alot of stupid things get to us. Whenever I needed someone to talk to she would be the one. She went through a life that was almost the same as what I went through in life, and so she knows what I or even she needs to do or say. Even though we would always have lots of fun, we would have our moments and fight, but alwways work things out. We'd always have each others back for everything. I guess what im trying to say is that, two people who are close always have their great needs and feelings, and especially their laughter in the relationship. Here are some times that @LOCATION and I shared and spent together that pretty much led up to laughter.I remember in @NUM grade, both of us would always try to hang out whenever we could. We were still young so it was hard to do be able to do anything becuase our parents wouldnt let us most the time. Whenever we did though, we would think about random games, and go to different places just to have fun. As we got older though we were trusted more and could do lots more of things, which was a good thing. Then I moved to @LOCATION, not the greatest thing, but it was for love. What made it better was that she still came over all the time. We would go and pick her up on @DATE and then on @DATE my mom would drive to school because my mom still went to work there in florence. Every night that she was there we would always stay up. I remember that I would always keep these little hot chocalate packages in my room and after my parents went to bed we'd sneak out to go get hot water for it so that we would have hot chocalate to drink. Some other times we would make coffee so that we could stay up longer. It was hard sometimes because my room was right across from my parents room and at the time I had beads hanging from my door. Fun times trying to keep quiet and not get caught. Sometimes when she came over she would bring all her make up and things so that we could dress each other up. One night we had blind folds on and do each others makeup.",16,19,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12852,21470,8,"Laughing is something that everyone experiences. It changes situations from bad to funny. It's like magic. I mean you don't need a wand or anything, just a twisted sense of humor. You just need a little common sense and a little bit of illogical thinking. I know that those are two entirely different things but isn't that what makes us @CAPS? isn't laughter just the response to hearing something illogical that differs from your common sense? No. It's not. Laughter is also an extremely helpful tool. you can do a lot of things with laughter. you can get out of trouble, get into trouble, start a friendship, end a friendship, get a job, lose a job, win a game and, lose a game. and that's not everything, mind you. But I'm not here to talk about all of those things, just one of them. making friends with laughter. just sit back and listen and maybe you'll learn something.Before we begin the story, let me just start by saying that I'm not exactly the nicest guy on the planet, and i know this, but I'm good at making people @CAPS. It's not even on purpose half of the time. the majority of my jokes and humor consists of depressing things. I honestly think that I get that response from people because they don't know how else to react. And this is why @CAPS or @CAPS or whoever invented sadists and masochists. Anyway lets get back on track. Once upon a time where teens were desensitized to the harsh reality of modern living there was a kid. that kids name was @PERSON. now I really hadn't known @PERSON for very long and, to be quite honest, i didn't really want to but he tagged along with me and grant and @PERSON back in the day. he always wore these awesome iron maiden t-shirts and listened to the type of music that i liked so i guess you could say it was fated but that's neither here nor there. One day we got to talking. We were both thinking about this big barrel that had been left in the track at our school. it was empty and plastic and when you're @NUM everything big and red and plastic looks fun. we decided that we would take the barrel and stand on it. Yes that was all we wanted to do with it. It never really crossed our minds that we could have taken it or built something with it. no, the only upstanding conclusion we could come to was to stand on it. and we did. and it was fun.  the next day we came to school and @PERSON was handing out invitations to his birthday party. i was pretty excited so i went. as it turns out, our lives are very very much alike. i think the first thing i noticed when i went to his house was the kitchen. it was like they took my kitchen and painted it a different color and then put it there. honestly i thought i was the only kid who lived the way i did. i used to get mad because my mom wouldn't ever buy matching dishes or silverware because we never really had the money and this kid had the most random assortment of dishes and such in his house. collectible versions of different pint glasses, mismatched silverware, logical dish placement. i know it sounds stupid but it used to make me happy.  When the other guys arrived we started to talk, or at least i did. we talked about some random stuff too like @CAPS videos and good movies we had seen recently. @PERSON and i always ended up talking about other stuff like travel and the future and dogs but that's just because we agreed that newer movies kind of sucked, too many explosions and not enough character development. eventually we started a fire and moved our conversations outside. see, it always seems like things are better when you look into the fire. and when the fire goes out, you want that feeling again. well i was prepared to fix it but everybody went inside except me and @PERSON (another guy at the party) so we decided to play around a bit. we went into @PERSON garage and found his @NUM and brake fluid. we sprayed it on the fire and i think my face got a little sunburned after that. The flames had gotten so close to my face that i could feel my eyelashes burning on the tips. Then we grabbed some more wood and dropped it on the fire. everybody came back outside to play around with it. i know I'm kind of a bad influence but when life gives you an opportunity to do something fun, you can't pass it up. We spent the rest of the night talking about girls and cracking jokes. I just wish we had a @CAPS-@CAPS-@CAPS. That night, i made some eternal friends.",16,20,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0

All i need to make those bad things seem like old memories is to have a long and pleasant laugh. It is ten times better if that laugh is shared with someone else. That's why when i moved to @LOCATION,@CAPS I tried to keep a look out for kids like me, who loved to laugh and make other people laugh. The first days were rough. I met a lot of new people that were all the same. Some just wanted to know my name and others to get to know me better, and that was fine. There was one person that I noticed was in multiple of my classes. So one day when our @CAPS teacher asked us to partner up and write a myth of creation or how something got to be the way it is. Quickly, I looked around to choose someone before every one would have a partner and I would be sitting there awkwardly without a partner. I asked a boy who was in few other of my classes. I had not really noticed or even heard him talk. He agreed to be my partner. We introduced ourselves and he told me his name was @PERSON. He had a very quite voice. I had barely understood his name, so i had to read it from his paper. We had to work on the paper together but it felt more like if we were doing it individually. I began by throwing some ideas around. @PERSON would then say something and laugh but I could never hear what he would say. We worked on the paper for a couple of days, continuing to only interchange some words.  Meanwhile I was still trying to make at least one good friend. I thought maybe threw that friend i could meet some of his friends and in time I would have my own set of friends. In the meantime I ate lunch with my sister @PERSON. You would think it would be slightly awkward or uncomfortable. It wasn't though, it was actually pretty nice because our bond had become stronger. That would work well for both of us until we made some friends. After some time she had made a couple of friends and was ready to move on. So one day while we were both eating lunch one of her new friends passed by and asked her to go sit with her. I hoped so bad that she would just say no or even say, maybe tomorrow, but no.  There I was sitting by myself in a lunch room full of eyes that were just judging who you were sitting with, if anyone. I began to eat my lunch faster than you could say sternocleidomastoid, and I was out of there. Panicking in the inside but completely calm on the outside, I paced the hallways looking for someone to hang out with. Then I saw ""That @CAPS"" from three of my classes. I casually walked up to him and tried to start a conversation. For some reason i felt relaxed not as if I was trying to make a new friend but as if I was already talking to one.  In the beginning, we were just two guys that talked about classes and how this school was different from my previous. Then all of a sudden we began to talk about movies especially the resent more funny ones. We could not stop laughing in all of our classes, especially auto mechanics. We would use up all of our shop time just trying to remember all of the funny lines from the movies and trying to say them or act them out the best we could. Soon we also found out that we watched many of the same t.v. shows. We could make each other laugh with pretty much anything one of us said. I had noticed this special quality in @PERSON that made him extremely funny. I wasn't sure what it was,but with anything he said I would just laugh uncontrollably. We were laughing buddies, but soon we actually became great friends. We had really bonded in between the laughter. During that time we would find out new things about each other. That made us realize that we were a lot alike. Its been a few months and we have only become greater friends. I had made friends before by making them laugh or laughing at there jokes. I knew this was different tho. I had made the greatest friend I had ever had. Now I'm moving and that's the worst part. I know that with the bond of sharing some of the greatest laughs of my life we will continue to stay friends for a long time.",20,18,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12854,21472,8,"I have lived in @CAPS @CAPS almost my whole life, I went to pre @CAPS all the way up to @NUM grade. @CAPS was about half way into my @DATE when my mom had told me the ""@CAPS"" news. Honey we are moving, i froze in shock i didn't know what to think, no we can't move. why she said, um maybe because im going into @CAPS @CAPS. I don't want to go somewhere where i have no clue who anybody is. Don't worry my mom said you will make some friends. Where are we moving any wise i asked? Lebanon she answered me in a soft @CAPS voice. @CAPS i guess its not that far away from here. There you go she said @CAPS wont be that bad once we get there and get everything settled in and unpacked. Yeah @CAPS i still don't know anybody there, @CAPS your cousin @PERSON goes there and he is a junior so he could maybe drive you to @CAPS everyday if you wanted and introduce you to some people. Okay i said i was excited @CAPS i didn't want to move away from @CAPS. We started to pack up our things, @CAPS took us about a week to get everything out of the old house into the new one. After the house was all packed and our things where out we started to clean. We cleaned from the up stares all the way down, head to toe that took us about two days tops to do. So in all total @CAPS took us about a week and two days to get everything packed, moved out, and cleaned. We said our @CAPS byes to our friends and family and where on our way. Its not like we will never see them again i said to my brothers. We finally pulled up to the house, @CAPS was so anxious to see what @CAPS looked like. My mom opened the doors go check @CAPS out she said, wow this place is amazing we love @CAPS the boys said. I told you that you guys would love @CAPS. We went up stares and picked out our rooms. there was only four bedrooms so the two younger boys had to share. When we where all done with that we stared to unpack our stuff. I was so tired from doing everything that after i was done unpacking my room i went and took a nape on my bed. When i woke up i realized that i have not unpacked everything like i though i did, so i finished with that. @CAPS started in about a week i was so excited @CAPS nervous @TIME the same time to see what @CAPS would be like.

All the aunts, uncles, and cousin come around my grandma's small kitchen table and talk. There is so many conversation going on and people talking loud and laughing, that to me it make feel like a home away from home. This was the case when some of us got together for a late birthday party for me, when I was in @LOCATION @DATE.   It was @DATE, my grandma, uncle, aunt, dad, my two cousin, and I; were sitting around the kitchen table eating cake and talking. We were talking about a problem that I was having. Some how my dad deiced to pretend like we were in court. My aunt said to @PERSON to go and get a wig for the judge, which was my uncle. @PERSON brought back this blond wig and she puts it on my dad's head, he looked so funny. Aunt @PERSON was fixing the front of the wig for him. I grab his phone and start taking a bunch of pictures of him in the wig. I send one to my mom saying, ""@CAPS mom dad is pretty."" We were all laughing so hard. Then my grandma deices to put on the wig. Grandma keep saying that it was itchy and tickling her. After she took off the wig, she stared to tell us a story about the time when my grandpa pocked her in the left side of her rump with a compass. She first set up the story for us, by telling us who the teacher was. It was a funny @DATE name that I don't remember. Uncle @CAPS was doing an impression of what he thought the teacher would be like. His impression was like the old bank owner on @PERSON. We all stared to laugh really hard. When my grandma finally got to the main part of the story, he was so mad at her, because she wrote his name down for talking in class and he also liked her. So he took a compass and poked her in the rump. For some reason my dad and uncle thought it was so funny that they made her say it over and over again in a rime. She couldn't say rump with out laughing. We all stared to laugh really hard because she couldn't say rump. Grandma was laughing so hard she would fall back into her chair and I though she was going to die of over laughter. The laughing got so bad we were starting to cry of laughing so much.  As you can see, my dad side really like to laugh and be funny.We are a great big fake @CAPS family. I believe that laughter is a very important part in any relationship you have with any one you meet. One of my favorite things to do is laugh and I will most likely laugh at anything some one says.

12856,21475,8," Do you remember the first day of @NUM grade? Everyone is awkwardly and excitedly standing there waiting for their seating arrangement. You have the middle school jidders and everything is just happening to fast, I remember all that. I went to school at @CAPS for my middle school years, my teacher was @PERSON. She was the type of teacher that was strict when it came to where you sat in class. If you didn't like someone, she would probably sit you by them thinking that you two would magically become friends. I was standing there in the corner with my best friend @CAPS, we were of course hoping that we would be seated next to each other. After we finally got our seating arrangements, we were not seated together. I was sat next to @PERSON-- a girl that I didn't know at all-- @PERSON, @PERSON and @PERSON. I was friends with everyone except @PERSON, who I have never saw before in my life. As class went on @PERSON talked about middle school and how it is so important to get good grades and be prepared for high school, we all sat there and as to what it looked liked day dreamed. No one really talked to anyone, there was still that awkward first day thing going on. @PERSON looked like a girl that would rip your head off if you said anything to her, so I kept my mouth shut.  @PERSON went on with her ""first day lecture"" and all of a sudden she cracked a joke in the middle of her speech, to get our attention. We all started laughing. I would have to say that it was a very good ice breaker. After everyone after everyone laughed for a while, it seemed like everyone loosened up a bit. @PERSON and I started talking about how that joke was only funny because it was so dang stupid. From then on we kept talking and she seemed like a cool person. @PERSON and I became partners for every project that we did and we were always together, she became my best friend after @NUM days; all because of laughter. I would have to say that the reason @PERSON and I became friends is because of laughter. I probably never would have talked to her in the first place; even though I am glad I did because now I have an awesome best friend! Middle school can be scary, excpecially on the first day of school. That's why I think laughter is such an important part in someones relationship, you can't get by without it!

Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and the time I was just living life with no purpose, no plans. Looking down on @CAPS little cousins or brother, I see joy, and laughter, and silliness. I see innocent soft faces who have no idea nor understanding for what is going on around them. As I watch them slowly grow out of their unusual habits, I find myself back @CAPS the year @DATE. A little girl, not in school yet, runs in her grandmother's yard on a @DATE's mid day. She flops her pig tails back and forth while hiding her hands in her size @NUM trousers with one eye closed and the other slightly opened watching her older sister run around looking for a place @CAPS hide.

I closed @CAPS eyes and reopened them @CAPS find myself in @DATE. It was a few days after the tragic happening of @NUM. Everyone met at grandma's house as always, kids in one room and adults in the other. I was playing in our small ball pit with the two youngest cousins, @PERSON and @ORGANIZATION, when we noticed that there was a small hole in the wall. ""@CAPS, look through."" @PERSON demanded.I took a deep breath and did what he asked.  ""@CAPS!"" I yelled The little hole gave us a vision of what was happening in the room next @CAPS us which held all the parents and old people with straight looks and serious tones. I let the little ones have a look, they didn't find it as interesting as I did but they wouldn't give me another chance @CAPS see. I pushed @CAPS way through. All three of us looking through something so small. We kept giggling, and talking. We did this for about @CAPS minutes, not knowing that our uncle was watching us for at least @CAPS minutes. He motioned the other adults @CAPS see what we were doing. One by one, noticing that the amount of people in the next room was decreasing. Soon, there wasn't any of them in sight. ""@CAPS did they all go?"" We panicked.Light, quite laughing was going on behind us. @PERSON looked toward @ORGANIZATION, @ORGANIZATION looked at me, I looked down @CAPS @PERSON, and at the same time we turned around and saw everyone smiling, laughing, and taking pictures of us. We stood still with red faces and soon started pointing fingers about who gave us the crazy idea of spying.  After that, it was like any day with family; everyone in the living room, food in the kitchen, warm hugs and kisses from grandma, people pinching @CAPS cheeks, big smiles and long loud laughs. I see friends shaking hands and kids yelling and screaming, people telling they're loved ones ""I love you"". I look down at @CAPS feet and with a blink of an eye, I'm back @CAPS @DATE. I raise @CAPS head up over @CAPS shoulders, see that I'm in grandmas living room babysitting the kids. I'm sixteen this year, and I don't believe that there is one day when I don't laugh.

12860,21479,8," Laughter can be helpful in many ways and with many things. Like, if your having a bad day, a friend can try and make you laugh to help you feel better. Or maybe something like you lost a loved one. Yes it's a very tragic thing, especially if you really close to that family member. People will still try and make you laugh and tell you that there in a better place and won't be in pain anymore. I have had some moments like this and I sometimes felt better after the person or persons have made me laugh. I also know that I have people that care for me and want me to be happy and full of laughter. The most recent time I have needed someone to help me laugh was yesterday. It was yesterday night, I had math homework that I needed too do. It frustrated me so much, I started too cry. i told my boyfriend this and he just started telling all of these silly jokes. They kind of helped. What helped the most though was when he had said he could come over this @DATE. I started smiling and laughing because I was so happy that he could. Another time that I have had laughter help me was when I was at @CAPS with my mom, dad, brother, and little sister about @NUM years ago. My brother decided that he want too take me on @CAPS @CAPS. I can't remember if that was the ride though. Anyway, he took me in it about @NUM or @NUM time. I was so scared, and wet that I didn't talk too him for the rest of the day. He finally apologized and took me too a face painter lady in one of the stores. I chose what I wanted on my face, I can't quite remember what it was though, I think it was some kind of fish. But, after she had finished, I looked in the mirror she had and I burst out laughing. I laughed for about ten minutes and said that I accepted his apology. When we arrived home a few days later, I took the hose and sprayed him with it just too get him back. And too be a little stinker of a sister, like all little sisters should be every once and a while in my opinion. Thank gosh it was during the @DATE because me and him did it a few more times just too be brats too mom and dad. Lastly, I remember this one time in @NUM grade when my best friend @CAPS was moving. I cried for days and days. Then finally he calls me and we talked for about @NUM hours, and talking too him just made me laugh, and wish that he hadn't of moved. At least I still got too talk too him. Only about once or twice though. anyway, those times talking too him made me so happy. We talked about his dogs. One of his dogs names is @CAPS, she was about @NUM months at the time. She started chasing her tail and when she went around about @NUM times, she tripped over her feet and fell on her rump. So, to end this trip down memory lane. Those three blasts from the pasts were the ones that made me laugh too help me feel better when I was feeling upset, or down.",16,15,0.0,31,0.0,0.0,0.0,31.0
12861,21480,8,"  Laughter in life is a good thing to have I believe. Once @CAPS I was @NUM year's old I had a and @CAPS. We always loved to hang out and do things together like take walks, or go to the beach, or go to the parks. What was so funny was that that we also loved to eat together too, maybe not out his dog bowl, but off of plates or on a picnic table. He was a cute dog. He had four little puppies named @CAPS-@CAPS, popcorn,big tail, and mountain. I named them all weird animal names because that's either what they smelled like or that's what they looked or loved doing.  Why we named my dog @CAPS was because he always smelt like @CAPS. I always took him on walks to make him a healthy dog. It made me very angry @CAPS he had puppies and a mate. I don't know why maybe just because head I really loved my dog and i wanted him to be mine only. My favorite friend. I thought in my head hey! that's my dog and you leave him alone and do not touch him. Well @CAPS he had puppies i finally realized in my head @CAPS just wanted a life of his own too, a family, and be a big boy dog. He didn't hate me, he loved me and giving him a family is what I allowed and it made him happy. What was funny about the little puppies was that they smelt like odd food, like @CAPS, @CAPS chops, or popcorn. My favorite puppy was @CAPS @CAPS because that's what he smelt like, not @CAPS but @CAPS. POPCORN was a good dog too so was the other dogs but @CAPS @CAPS was a biter. It's funny because those little puppies love to bite and chew on stuff. The second you leave my puppies alone they will so eat everything. One time @CAPS we went on a trip to another state he had to leave the puppies alone with a babysitter, and @CAPS we came back they ate up a lot of the clothes and destroyed everything. I also had @CAPS too but they weren't good animals or pets to have they also ate everything up, and they stink. No not like @CAPS or popcorn but something else gross. The puppies loved to nibble on your toes and your hair. They had small teeth but oh they hurt. Stinky breath those dogs had I don't know why but there stinky. One of my favorite story about @CAPS was that he never liked to swim. It was odd to me because you would have thought cats hate water more than dogs. Well @CAPS did not know how to swim so I had to teach him myself as a good owner and all. Well @CAPS ever he doggy-paddled, he stuck his head underwater and swam forward. I don't know why, but I always thought can he breath like that? or is it just a doggy thing. Well eventually I got him over that, I don't think it was good for him to swim underwater. Like cats he used to never like water, it was just a phobia my dog had I guess. But I tried my best to get him over it. @CAPS I moved around states I had to leave him it was the saddest thing in my life ever. But we all move on right. Laughter I think is so good to have in your life because it can help you become more anti-depressed and not have to focus on the bad things in life. Every now and then @CAPS I am sad i just go and think of @CAPS. I had other animals like @CAPS, @CAPS, @CAPS, and cats. Personally I love cats more than dogs but @CAPS will always be the first. My cats weren't really that social to me, there lazy.What was so funny about my cats was that I named one of them @CAPS. Why I named that cat @CAPS was because he was all black but with white feet. It was funny because @CAPS ever he got mad he did a lot of turning and jumping around. He was a wild kitty. I named one of my cats @CAPS because he was so fast at everything. What was funny about him was @CAPS ever you play around with him he charged off like he ate a bowl of cat nip. Having animals in my life to be with gave me a story of laughter in my life, and happiness. Laughter I think is a good important part of relationships too. If you do not laugh in your relationship then I believe that the couple are not so happy. Laughter can be good many time's, but also can be a insult too. If it means becoming a insult to some people or even laughing at people is rude.  Having laughter in your life is something you should always keep because it can help you become happy in many situations and problems you encounter in life. To be happy you should have laughter.",15,17,0.0,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.0

On the day of @DATE was the day that I will laugh about for the rest of my life. On this day my boyfriend @PERSON from @LOCATION decided that @CAPS wanted to take me out to an early breakfast. @CAPS called me around four in the morning saying that @CAPS was starving and that @CAPS needed some food in his stomach. So @CAPS picked me up around five am and we went to @ORGANIZATION. We sat there drank coffee and ate pancakes. We finished very early so @PERSON wanted to go for a drive, let me remind @CAPS @CAPS's from @LOCATION so @CAPS has @CAPS clue where anything is in @LOCATION.

We are in his @DATE poniac which is not the greatest vehicle to be going for a ride in around this town, because around here @CAPS need a four wheel drive vehicle otherwise @CAPS're probably going to get stuck where ever @CAPS go. We were doing great at first because we stayed on the pavement roads, but @PERSON wanted to explore the gravel roads. So we started to go down a gravel road and we both decided that maybe @CAPS was time to go home. When we came up to another road @CAPS decided @CAPS was going to turn around. That was not the greatest idea. @CAPS seen the sign for the street but @CAPS turned the wrong way into a field. @CAPS was okay, @CAPS as first @CAPS was . Until @CAPS went to back up, and the car wouldn't move. I looked at him and laughed and said ""I told @CAPS that @CAPS needed to go right not left."" @CAPS then looked at me and said, ""@CAPS's not stuck I just need to try a little more, and we'll be out."" One thing that @PERSON did not know is that @CAPS had been warm in @LOCATION the last couple of days, so all the fields were very wet and soft. I looked at him and told him that @CAPS might not want to @CAPS that but @CAPS said that is was fine @CAPS's done this before. So I got out of the car and went and stood by the road. @PERSON tried to get the car out of the mud for at least ten minutes, and that was not the greatest thing to @CAPS, because now the tires were berried under the mud. I started to laugh so hard because @CAPS got out of the car and looked at me and said I should have listened. @PERSON had one more thing that @CAPS wanted to try, because @CAPS offense but @CAPS's a boy and they can @CAPS everything themselves. So @CAPS told me to get into the car and put @CAPS in reverse so I did as @CAPS said, then @CAPS said okay lightly push on the gas as I push, @CAPS I did a little more then lightly push on the gas. I looked up and @PERSON was covered in mud from head to toe. @CAPS was the greatest thing I have seen in my life, my boyfriend had got what @CAPS deserved because @CAPS wouldn't listen to me. I looked at him and my eyes instantly started to water, I was trying to hold my laugh in, but @CAPS just wasn't working. I started to laugh and @CAPS looked at me and said, ""@CAPS think this is funny?"" @CAPS then pulled me out of the car and shut the door and started to wipe mud all over my face, I was laughing so hard that i fell and took him down with me right into the mud. @CAPS to make the story even better, we went to go open the doors to the car, and @CAPS remember how I told @CAPS that I put the car in reverse @CAPS when @CAPS pulled me out i didn't take @CAPS out of reverse, and his car locks when its not in park. I then looked at him and said, "" @CAPS @CAPS have an extra key on @CAPS by chance?"" ""@CAPS"", @CAPS said, ""@CAPS?"" I looked at him and said, ""@CAPS lets see the car is still running, the windows are up, our phones are still in the car, and @CAPS to finish @CAPS off the doors are locked."" @CAPS looked at me and his mouth dropped. We sat there waiting for almost an hour and a half before anyone came down the road. @CAPS took use about forty-three minutes to get the doors unlocked, and then @CAPS took us about thirty minutes to get @CAPS unstuck. When I got home I told my family the story, and we still laugh about @CAPS to this day.",18,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

Ok enough @CAPS my mom, @CAPS my dad he was an exepttional man and father.He worked hard to support me and my brother. When my brother and I were younger my dad would always put on funny masks and do funny things to get me and my brother to laugh. Or he would put on a scary mask and scare us tp have himself a laugh.My father would go roller blading with us and try and trip us but he couldnt always keep up and if you got going to fast his legs would wobble and he would fall and me and my friends would just laugh.Every my parents past me and my family has been seperated and it sucks but laughter to me is there world right @CAPS. I could have been my fathers twin, think hard @CAPS that.What Laughter Is All @CAPS ''Laughter Is The Shortest Distance Between Two People''.

12864,21483,8," My grandfather always used to say, ""life is like a kaleidoscope, you can keep turning and turning and it @MONTH seem like it is changing, @CAPS really it's just repeating itself."" @CAPS i have always wondered if the statement really applies to life, and if it does why would we want life to continue in the same pattern, if it isn't going like we had planned.  When i was twelve me and my two little sisters were split up and three thousand miles were crammed in between us. i was put here in @LOCATION while they remained in @LOCATION, where i was born. At first the pain of those three thousand miles was devastating. it was like i had two of my essential organs removed from my body. Eventually though time passed and the agony lessened @CAPS grip on our lives. It @MONTH seem cruel @CAPS most of the time now the thought of them doesn't cross my mind. maybe @CAPS true what they say, ""out of sight, out of mind.""  @CAPS sad to think of how close my sisters and I were before the change. we did everything together. we are very close in age, the youngest and I are only @NUM years apart. i remember all the times we would spend outside on humid @DATE days. We would look as white as ghosts because of all the sunscreen my mother would generously apply to our skin. Times were different then, they were happy, i was happy. If i think really hard I can see us sitting on the shag carpet in my room, playing with dolls until the sunlight melted slowly into darkness. If only i could have that moment again even for a second, then maybe i could feel that happy content feeling once again.   Although much time has passed since our separation i still have those days when i feel that my world is caving in around me because they are so far away. I'll give them a call and the questions are always uncomfortable at first, like between strangers meeting for the first time. i can feel the three thousand mile scab on my heart reopen and it bleeds as though i am leaving all over again. I ask myself why do i bother to call if it hurts this bad? And then i hear it, like the beautiful sound of classical music to my ears, I hear them laugh. I have that feeling i needed all of a sudden, i am happy. With every small giggle my smile grows because i know i have made them feel whole again and for a second i have let them forget about for far i really am. Their laughter makes those three thousand miles evaporate into the air. In those moments of laughter i know that we are close again that we are sisters, not strangers. It's true what my grandfather says, because no matter how my life changes i will always have that feeling of total bliss when i hear the sweet laughs of my little sisters.",20,21,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0
12865,21484,8," I rested my back on the cool steel of the lockers trying to ease my nerves. ""@CAPS game is everything we have worked for- every excruciating practice, every tedious drill, and every game film we have studied down to the minutia. It was all to prepare us for tonight. @CAPS we lose tonight, everything we have worked was for nothing."" I listened attentively as @PERSON, our team captain, spoke. The words she chose for our pre-game speech were straight to the point, and anything but sugar coated. As I glanced around the locker room it was easy to observe that everyone one of my teammates was anxious. Emilie was vigorously chewing what was left of her nails, while @LOCATION preferred to show her uneasiness by the constant tapping of her foot. @PERSON finished her speech, and with the break of our huddle we entered the gymnasium. The stands were packed with familiar faces of our small town. In a small section of the stands there was a group of people wearing colors not native to our school. @CAPS brutal reminder brought my attention back to warm ups.  The twenty minutes we had for warm ups seemed to last no longer than two minutes. The announcer began to state our starting line up, but it was no use. The roar of the crowd overpowered the speaker system. It seemed as @CAPS everyone from our town of five thousand was attending the game. Not an empty space was left in the bleachers. The bench vibrated from the stomping and clapping of the crowd, threatening with every shake to collapse. The starting five for each team walked out to the center of the court for tip off. With the loss of the tip off our team was quickly put under pressure. From the first possession of the game we were chasing our opponent.  The first two quarters ended with a dead even score. Feeling discouraged my team regrouped in the locker room for @DATE time. We entered the locker room a moment before my @CAPS. I took @CAPS opportunity to @CAPS around at the expressions' of my teammates. Nothing, but disappointment and fear crossed their face's. My @CAPS opened the door, and I instinctively braced myself for the throwing of keys against the wall, or the smash of the clip board. My team had witnessed these acts of rage countless times before. To my surprise, my @CAPS entered with complete poise and composure, as @CAPS our first @DATE of treacherous play didn't phase him. We were not yelled at, or criticized. Instead, he rubbed his eyes, face down and shoulders hunched over. His belly began to shake, shortly followed by his shoulders. My first hypothesis was that he was crying, but then to my amazement, I heard the soft chuckle of our @CAPS. Soon that soft chuckle metamorphosised into a stomach thrusting, loud cackle. My team exchanged confused glances, and waited for my @CAPS's explanation in anticipation.  ""@CAPS at yourself!"" @CAPS @CAPS ordered. ""@CAPS are all more tentative than when I asked @PERSON out to my first dance!"" We could always rely on @CAPS for an unrelated metaphor. Even @CAPS it wasn't related to basketball, the point was clear. ""@CAPS @CAPS guys would just believe in yourself the way I believe in @CAPS, @CAPS game would be a blow out! Instead, @CAPS are playing like a bunch of bunny foo-foos!"" We all laughed with the thought of playing like the nursery rhyme we had hear so frequently when we were children. The speech @CAPS @CAPS gave eased us all. The confident team we should have been from the start of the match was now prepared to win the @DATE. To think that @CAPS confidence came from just one comforting laugh seemed almost improbable.  The whistle blew to start the @DATE. We played with such assertiveness and confidence that @CAPS @CAPS were to compare one @DATE with the other, it would @CAPS like two different teams. We grasped the lead early in the @DATE, and sustained it for the rest of the game. The victory of that night's game lead us one round deeper into the state tournament. As I walked back to the locker room I glanced around the massive gym. I looked at: the crowd, score board, opponents, referees and news reporters. I realized how easy it is to get caught up everything that shouldn't effect @CAPS. All the distractions easily make @CAPS forget the main purpose of why @CAPS play the game. Occasionally we need reminders, like the calming laugh of @CAPS @CAPS. Without that reassuring laugh, my team never would have united, and defeated our opponent.",25,25,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0
12866,21485,8,"Freshmen year, @CAPS season. I have been @CAPS for about eight years now, I made varsity in a @NUM school in @LOCATION my first year in high school. Being the only freshmen on the varsity squad, everybody knew who I was, ""The short kid on the varsity @CAPS squad."" @CAPS a eighth grader I won junior state and wrestled all the way through the brackets without @CAPS a full match. Meaning that I pinned everyone in the first round. I couldn't be touched. Going into high school I knew that I wouldn't have @CAPS easy of a time like in grade school. I was completely right. My coach had to be the funniest person that I have ever met in my life. @PERSON was my @CAPS teacher since the @NUM grade and has been my role model all the way through life. He made the funniest jokes about wrestlers on the team. A lot of people disliked @PERSON @CAPS @CAPS and him got along great. I ended the season freshmen year with @NUM wins, @NUM pins, and @NUM losses. I still to @CAPS day haven't been pinned. Which got @CAPS the wrestler of the year awarded by my @CAPS coach @PERSON. When the season rolled around to regionals I knew that I had a shot to go to state. There were six guys in my weight class and four of the six I have previously beaten in early season. I had to just worry about my match ahead of @CAPS and wrestle mistake free.  At the @NUM pound weight class there is a bunch of little kids. I was definitely the most experienced in my weight class. I got seated first seed. The second seed was @PERSON from @ORGANIZATION. He dropped weight so he could try and take my seating for state. My first match I wrestled @CAPS from @CAPS-@CAPS-@CAPS. The match was very short-lived. I pinned him in about @NUM seconds. After my match with @CAPS I walked to my coach and he told @CAPS a quote that I will never forget, ""@CAPS, @CAPS's lonely at the top, @CAPS the view is excellent."" @CAPS quote stuck in my head throughout all of my next matches. I won my second and third matches and was in the semi-finals. I was one round away from going to state automatically. I wrestled @CAPS from @PERSON and he weighed @NUM lbs. I knew that he was a good wrestler even though I had about @NUM pounds on him. I was getting ready to wrestle and I seen @CAPS warming up across the gym from @CAPS. @CAPS he was jumping around getting warmed up I see him trip and fall on his face. My coach had seen the same thing and started making fun of him. @CAPS was the funniest thing that I have ever witnessed. I wrestled through the match and pinned him in double overtime to go to state. My coach walks up to @CAPS and says ""@CAPS took you that long to pin someone who can't even warm up without falling on his face."" @PERSON had about three teeth total in his mouth. He lost them from a lot of different ways. He was a adventure man. He loved white water rafting and loved the sport of @CAPS. When I moved, I was far away from my idolized @CAPS coach, @CAPS we still hit @CAPS up on the facebook and chitchat. To @CAPS day, he is still the funniest man I know and still my idol.",20,16,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12867,21487,8,"Many people @MONTH think that laughter is not a big part of a relationship. i truly think that have a good laugh with your spouse is a good thing because it means that you are having a good time with each other. I will tell you a true story when i and my girlfriend were laughing and having a good time, and i will talk about another time when laughter was a big part in my life. In the next @NUM paragraphs i will decide how laughter help @CAPS out a lot in my life. laughter is all about having fun and it should be meant to hurt someone or make them upset or mad at you. I think some people really mean to hurt people because they don't care what they say to others and that's why laughter sometimes can hurt people. I have said some things to people that i thought were funny but the person i was saying it to didn't think it was funny. This first story I'm going to tell you is about @CAPS and @LOCATION. I have been dating @PERSON for about a month now and laughter is a big part in our relationship. @PERSON and i like to tell jokes to each other and make each other laugh and smile. If we didn't laugh and have a good time with each other than were would this relationship go. It wouldn't go the way i would want it t go. So i try everyday to make her laugh and smile at some of the things that i say because its a important thing in life to @CAPS anyways. @PERSON makes @CAPS laugh all the time and i think thats a good thing to her because she can be a very funny person all the time. So as long relationships have some laughter in it most of them will go for a while. The one person i think that has made @CAPS laugh the most is probably my dad. My dad every day when he comes to pick @CAPS up he always has something funny to say. I don't think he has not said something funny one day for a long time. The times when my dad is having a bad day at work and then when he comes home and is still in a bad mood i try to say something funny to get him out of his bad mood, and if that doesn't work i just go to my room to get away from him. But most of the time my dad comes home in a good mood because his job is very easy and he likes the people that he works with. Now that would have been a different story if we still lived in I'm @ORGANIZATION. When we lived in @ORGANIZATION my dad had to commute back and forth to work from @LOCATION to @ORGANIZATION. That was about a hour drive one way, so it put him not in a very good mood.but i didn't get to really see him much when we lived over in the @LOCATION. so anything that funny i think i always try to say just to keep the laughter going.I believe that laughter is a big part in having friends. most friends like to joke around and laugh at things that are funny to them. so when you have a friend that likes to smile or likes to tell jokes usually they become friends and that person gets more friends and they whole community starts to like him in-till he says something that makes a lot of people mad. At our baseball practices @CAPS, @PERSON, @PERSON, and @CAPS we like to tell jokes jokes or say something that will make the whole team laugh. another person that is funny to @CAPS is @LOCATION. @LOCATION tells a lot of jokes and has funny face exasperation, and the last person that is funny to @CAPS is @PERSON is one of those guys that thinks he inst funny but really is. I think i have a good friend relationship with all those people.I just told you why i think a good laugh is a good thing in a relationship. It is good around your parents so you can have a good relationship with them. I hope you liked my story. I enjoyed writing on this topic because it explains about @CAPS and it explains what i do with my spouse and my friends. I think that everybody has laughter in there life day in and day out to keep a good attitude wit people.",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12868,21488,8," When I was a young boy I used to laugh at anything I could, but as a kid who didn't? As I got older and grew more, I developed a great sense of humor that to my advantage made me a young people pleas-er. I grew more and more developing a stronger, more confident sense of humor. I could always remember making people laugh and loving the attention I received from humor.  As my body grew older and my humor grew more funny I had made myself more dependent on my people pleasing personality. In addition, I then taught myself how to alter my voice and change my tone for a more humorous effect. It was a step I knew was appropriate to advance my humorous personality. I had no intention of loosing my humor, so I used it to my advantage.  I used my humor to boost my @CAPS count, to get attention from non-accepting peers, and to get the attention that I thrived on. I had began to be accepted by higher peer groups that used to look down on me and it seemed as if I had a lot of the attention. Anything I could do to make my fellow peers laugh was a goal for me. Anything from rolling down stairs, telling jokes, making teachers angry which students thought was funny, and occasionally destroying things. All this just so I could fit into the crowd that used to reject me. As I advanced into high school I knew my humor needed work to keep my peers still laughing, I just didn't know what kind of work I needed. That was when I started to ultimately loose my funny, humorous personality. I had then dropped in the peer ranks, down to the kids I thought were once called strange. I was friends with people who didn't always keep their heads up and were constantly down and seemed never positive. I was letting people that I called friends drag me to the bottom when I knew I should be more at the top. This was my first major downfall in which I had successfully lost my humorous personality. One of my friends especially brought me down more than anyone else, down to a father level of being unhappy. That so called ""@CAPS"" took me down so far that I needed therapy to help me get back up to a normal level of happiness. I finally realized that it wasn't fun to be someones @CAPS who only drags you down. I finally broke free of that clutch when she moved, I wasn't mean enough to say I didn't wanna be friends with her, it was just to hard for me. When she moved it allowed me to heal myself and pay more attention to my humor. I had broke my dark days away and started back on my endless trail of humor. It was hard to accept the fact that I had lost my humor for what seemed to be forever, and lost my spot in the social bracket which would be hard to regain. But after a month of hard work and focus on both school and humor I had got my personality back to normal! Instantly after I regained my humor I began to feel more happy. I received more attention and felt like I was back to were I should be, although I was just a little lower. Back in the saddle of humor, back the laughs of my peers, back to the smiles, and most importantly back to the way I used to be. I had to regain all of my humor and personality, my tones, voices, and jokes but it was worth it, in a strange way. As I now continue my humor as a junior and I have not successfully lost it yet, but there is always a future. I managed to turn the best thing I had to the worst I have felt in a matter of weeks, then right back up again. In the end its not what you have that matters it is what you can do to please yourself and in the end I would not change a thing!",21,20,0.0,41,0.0,0.0,0.0,41.0

12870,21490,8,"  Laughter saved my life. Growing up, my life was pretty normal. Me, my little brother, mom, and dad, all living happily together in a nice suburban area. But two years ago, everything changed; and it seemed as though it wasn't for the better. My parents got a divorce. It was all very strange because at that time in my life I thought that that couldn't happen to me; it was impossible. As I talked to my friends and family about it, I learned to live with the fact that my family would never be the same again. But thought I came to grips with my new life, I still was unhappy a lot of the time. But the times when I was with my best friends and caring family, were the times that I forgot about all of the things going on at home.  George and I have been really close friends since the @NUM grade. We are inseparable. Though I have many other friends, he is the one I would always turn to if there's a problem. He knows me better than anybody else. We talk every day at school, we text message each other every night, and hang out almost every weekend. The night that my parents told me they were getting a divorce I called him crying. He told me that in the end it would all be okay, and he told me that he was always there for me if I needed anything. At that point in time it was clear to me that I had something that not a lot of people can say they had in their lifetime: A true friend who would be there through anything with me. He and I would joke about all my problems. To some, that @MONTH seem a little strange; but it was almost therapeutic to me. Making fun of my life, made it easier to live it in a sense. It helped me to realize that I need to let go of the past, and that just because there's a rough patch, doesn't mean that the rest of my life is destined to be this way. George knew how to cheer me up, and he could always tell when I needed a good talk, or a good laugh to make my day better.  A girl always needs another girl in her life to tell secrets, to do crazy things, and to lay on the couch all day watching sappy love movies with. For me, its @CAPS. When we're together there is no stopping us. She was always right by my side through my parents divorce. She was there with me, my last night in my house before we moved out. We sat on my bed in my empty room, recalling all the memories the house had given us. Some would think this would be a sad time, but all we did was laugh. Because all of the memories were good ones.We weren't crying because we were upset; we were crying from laughing about all of our insane adventures for hours. To me, that's a pretty good reason to cry.We re-lived our best moments that night, and we weren't going to let the situation make us upset. We wanted to make our last memory in my house a good one; that we would always remember.  My family is quite strange; but we do know how to have a good time. I don't have many family members, but I think that because we are so tightly knit, we get along really well. Whether we're out in the backyard playing a game of wiffle ball, or in the house playing pranks with whoopie cushions, it's always a fun time at my @CAPS @PERSON's house. During the rough times of the divorce, I would spend a lot of time at my @CAPS's house because I didn't have to worry about being questioned all the time about how I was feeling; I just had to worry about if I should bring sneakers to go on a hike, or if I should bring my pajamas in case we decided to have a movie night sleepover. That house is a place I still go to just relax, and forget about whatever @MONTH be worrying me. @CAPS @PERSON's is a safe haven for me to just let go, and have a good time with some of my favorite people in the world; my family.  If I didn't have all these important people in my life, I don't know what would have become of me. As I grow up, I'm realizing that these people have molded the person I am today. They helped me through the roughest time in my life, and that proves how much they really care about me. Some say laughter is the best medicine; I say it's love. Laughing helps to get you through terrible times, but the people who make you laugh are really what matter most. I can honestly say that every one of these people have made me a better person, and I love them with all my heart.",25,25,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0
12871,21491,8," Life is a serious matter that should be taken into consideration. Life is what you make it and I have gave my best efforts to achieve this goal; even when it seems senseless. It maybe be hard to not be an effect of the worlds chaos and daily epidemic but doesn't seem easier or less stressful to smile than to frown. To live life in the moment with no worries of what is gonna happen just to be care free, I would consider it exhilarating. To be nothing but the purest form of tranquility.   My memories as a child are faint, but I am glad to say that I have some. Happiness as a child is most pure in my position . I long for that purity I once had, as most do. It was my favorite pair of plastic barbie high heal shoes or my special princess backpack with every princess or @CAPS @CAPS. It was my parents making funny faces that made me explode in laughter because I could not possible hold it in any longer. All I longed for was a pick-nick under my favorite long green haired willow tree, to feel as free as the birds, to sing their beautiful songs, and to dance around with a never ending smile. It's the fragile youth of a child I longed for. It's a fragile youth of a child. As life goes on my purity has faded and the distance from people, the community, and myself has extended till I felt alone in sol om. I had changed as person when life when life burned me one to many times. I felt god had betray me if not hated me. I then had became a stone cold wall that no one could penetrate. But as I gazed into the mirror I no longer seen a @CAPS for life just hatred. This moment in time changed my life perspective. My strong hatred for the world was begin to handicap me in various if not most important aspect. If couldn't open up to myself - how could I open up to the world? To @CAPS, to learn, to be free, and to grow was my ultimate goal. Within myself I learned the most important lesson; laughter and wiliness to be optimistic, compassionate, and understanding. Someone once said ,""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""I believe this is an honest opinion worth trying to prove. Laughter changed my life, my world, and it's a reoccurring symptom that take pride in everyday. In my most embarrassing moments, most angry of times, and even within my deepest sorrows I still manage to scrap up a smile. Helping people helped me realize and understand this is passion of mine. I want to help the world not hide from their pain but just to realize life can take a twisted turn and still end up being alright. Even within the deepest darkest caves, their is always a rock awaiting to crumb to bring light. To me their is always a light at the end of the tunnel. In my light -- a smile can carry. I want to be that light. I want to be that re-leaving feeling that everything will be all right. so I live me life through a gracious smile. In my perspective if you create a smile and you will receive three more. This is my motto,"" @CAPS life for what it's new adventures bring, just smile, the world will continuously turn as life rolls on.""",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12872,21494,8,"Laughter. Some might think of it as just a simple reaction to something funny, but in reality laughter can be many things such as a way to cope with situations, a way to express yourself, or just a simple way to enjoy yourself when you are around friends. For me the meaning of laughing has changed a lot during my lifetime, when I was younger I used to laugh to enjoy myself or just to have fun with peers, but as I have grown older I have used laughter to cope with situations. On @DATE the morning of my @NUM birthday I found out some disturbing and disappointing news, that day I found out that my mom had passed away. When I first found out I didn't know what to do the only thing that I felt I could do was cry and grief about it and shut down into a depressed stage, many of my friends tried to help me and tried to tell me that ""things were going to be okay"". I knew they were right, but the only thing I could think was even if things turn out okay things will never be the same. At this time I thought to myself what will @CAPS be like? what am I going to do on mothers day?, and my biggest question of all how was I supposed to celebrate my own birthday?. It's hard knowing that someone that I love and had been with for @NUM years of my life is gone, but since my mom has passed away I have tried to stay focused on the positives and what she would have wanted for me like graduating high school, becoming successful, and not letting my life spiral down hill. Even though everyday for me is hard I still try to push through it and just remember that my mom wouldn't want me to give up on my life over her passing. You might ask yourself how I am coping with this loss, and the answer to that is that I have learned to cope with my situation with laughter. Growing up my mom always told me that ""laughter is the best medicine"". And after losing her I realized that that statement was true.Now whenever I get upset or sad I remind myself to think about the memories that I have had with my mom and laugh about the good experiences and times we had , and I sometimes even find myself laughing at some of the arguments we had. Laughing has been helping me cope fairly well in the past four months since my mom has passed away, and I hope it continues to help in the future, but I continuously think that ""sure I can laugh about things now, but what about in ten years?"" I guess the future is just going to remain a mystery for that, but one thing I do know about my future is that I will become successful, and even if laughter doesn't always work for me I will stay strong and be sure to live my life the way I would if I still had my mom, it will be hard doing it without the guidance and authority of having my mother there, but fortunately I am not dealing with any of this alone.One person that has been there through the whole situation has been my aunt, she has been in my life since day one, my mom and I even lived with her. I am grateful that my aunt has been there for me during my life, if she wasn't I don't know where I would be right now, she has taught me that I can't isolate myself or stop being a teenager just because I don't have my mom, but to live life to the fullest and live the life my mom would have wanted to see me live, she also tells me that laughing at bad situations is okay and to not keep things bottled up and I am very happy I have someone to go through this with.Having someone there for me in such a tough situation is very reassuring to me. Knowing that I have someone to go to and just talk about the past and be able to have someone to laugh with about it. Laughing is hard when you do it by yourself but one thing that I have noticed is that when you have friends and family that are going through the same situation as you it is easier to share your feelings and I think it also makes it easier to laugh when you have people that you are close to and people that care about you around. In some situations laughter might not be the best thing to do, but the best advice I can give to someone who might happen to be going through a similar situation is to not stop living your life and be something great and try to release some of the stress of a situation by laughing with friends.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

If your in a bad mood or just cant get happy, laugh at things cause i am sure it will lighten up your mood and i will tell you what, its also very good for you in many ways. If people didn't laugh then this world world would be a very depressing, you smile at someone who isn't the happiest could totally change their mood. So as i have told you before i am a very happy and energetic person and laughing is what i do best,and i smile at everyone around me. well i have a story for you, i like to volunteer at homeless shelters and old folks home cause i believe i should share my happiness with everyone else around me it makes my soul feel good to help people out. This one after noon i was doing what i do best laughing and having a good time at the old folks home making people smile, they all love having me around cause they say i cheer them up. I run around room to room bringing in vases of flowers opening their curtains to let the beautiful sunshine in, i always told them vitamin @CAPS is good to warm up the soul. There was this one man there who had never have a smile on his face and i did the same to him as i did to the other residents and no matter what i did he would never smile. When ever i came in he was always gazing out the window with a dead look on his face, so i had ask the nurses why he was so grumpy and quiet and they had told me he was a veteran. He didn't have much family from what i understood, or well at least they didn't visit him much they just dropped him off cause they didn't want to deal with the grumpiness any more. but i have a heart of gold and i feel like i should share. I had decided one day that i was going to turn that frown on his cute little face upside down, and make him feel happy and smile and interact with the other residents. So as usual i went in and did my daily routine to all the other rooms, we talked did some laughing and all sorts of stuff. I had saved the little old man for last i wasn't sure what his name was or what the what his whole background was like but i was going to go for it! I went in and he was staring out the window as usual, i hesitated for a minute cause i didn't know how he would react. So i went up and started talking to him, i introduced m self but he didn't seem to pleased. I asked him his name and he told me it was none of my business and that totally shot me down made me feel like i was the bad guy. So i started talking to him and asked him about his life, he had slowly opened up to and told me about all the stuff he had seen in the @LOCATION war. He turned out to be a nice guy, all those nurses were wrong about him they didn't even try. We laughed for hours me and him, and it didn't get old. Ever since i talked to him he has been progressively started interacting with the others, they just didn't give him the time of day to explain his feelings or someone to talk to. So think about it next time your going to the store and you see someone who doesn't look like they're having the best day, and shot them a smile!!! :)",18,18,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12874,21500,8," Do you ever have those weekends when you hang out your best friend and just spend the whole time laughing? Many people don't get the chance to have a day filled with laughter because they don't have people to laugh with. In my case I am always laughing and always surrounded with people that never stop laughing. My best friend is one of the funniest people I know. I could be in the worst of moods and @CAPS always knows how to put a smile on my face. @ORGANIZATION and I hang out all the time. Every time we @CAPS together we @CAPS constantly laughing to the point to where we cant breathe. One day we were both just having a rough day. All the drama with friends and boyfriends was putting so much weight on our shoulders. I was sitting at home on the couch when I get a phone call from @ORGANIZATION. ""@CAPS @CAPS you doing today?"" @ORGANIZATION asked. ""@CAPS just sitting at home watching movies. You?"" I replied ""@CAPS i am having a bad day, would you wanna come over or something?"" @ORGANIZATION said in an upset tone. ""@CAPS. Hold on, let me ask."" I said as I was running to my parents room. My parents of course said yes. About an hour later I got picked up by @CAPS dad. When I got in the car I could just tell by the way @CAPS looked that @CAPS was having a bad day and just needed to have some fun. When we got back to her house we went in her room and started talking. About five minutes after the conversation had started we were both crying like babies because of the problems that were going on. we weren't only crying because of sad things. There was a point in the conversation where we were laughing so hard that we started to cry again. @ORGANIZATION and I could sit there for hours and laugh to the point where there was no stopping us. @CAPS that day was the day. @CAPS dad walked in the room because of all the noise. ""@CAPS is going on in here?"" @CAPS asked with a stern voice. ""@CAPS dad."" We said still laughing. ""@CAPS then."" @CAPS replied with a really confused face walking out of the room. Closing the door behind him. That made us laugh even harder. We were laughing so hard that @ORGANIZATION fell off of her bed. ""@CAPS you @CAPS!"" I tried asking but it didn't really come out because I was laughing so hard. All @ORGANIZATION could do was roll on the floor laughing. @CAPS you knew @ORGANIZATION you would know that once @CAPS gets going @CAPS thinks that everything in the universe is funny, literally. The rest of the night we just sat on her bed and talked about everything. Stuff that either happened two years ago or just happened that week. I remember her telling me a story about when @CAPS lived somewhere else and it was seriously the funniest story i have ever heard. I've been best friends with her for three years now and I never get sick of her. Some people that hang out with @ORGANIZATION and I don't really understand why half the stuff we say is funny. A few months ago we were hanging out with some friends and all of the sudden @ORGANIZATION screamed, ""@CAPS on my finger!"" @CAPS you were to just hear that from someone you would @CAPS be disgusted but when @CAPS screamed that I started laughing so hard my stomach hurt. One time when we were sitting in her room @CAPS wanted to paint my nails and @CAPS picked this ugly brownish gold color. @CAPS started to paint my nails. ""@ORGANIZATION it looks like i have @CAPS on my finger!"" I said in a loud voice. ""I think it looks very nice."" @CAPS replied with this certain smile on her face. Ever since that night @CAPS on my finger has always been our inside joke. @ORGANIZATION and I have the funnest times together. Times that you can only have with a best friend. The hours we spend just sitting there laughing over the simplest things you couldn't do with anyone else. I am so thankful to have someone that I can share all this laughter with. Remember, you @CAPS lucky that you have people that can make you laugh. Like I said not everyone has that person in there life.",17,20,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0

I am one of those people that believes that this quote has a ton of truth and meaning. The best true story that I could tell you that involves me and laughter is about my dad and I.   When I was little and still living with my dad, my mom fought with my dad all the time and neither one of them where ever happy. My dad and mom both had good jobs but they never had money to do anything because my mom loved spending money and got them both into dept. My dad had to sell stuff of his all the time to help pay off all the dept. My parents got divorced wich was a good thing for us all. I got to hang out with my dad and I found out how much fun he is and how funny he can be. My dad and I started going hunting and all sorts of stuff like that. I found that my mom is even worse when she is happy because she gets vary hyper and loud, or you could just say annoying. She gets me to laugh every once and a while but its always at her rather than with her.  I love being with my dad because I always have fun and learn something that will be vary helpful to me.  I think that laughter is important to have in any kind of friendship. If you pay attention to how you are around the people you like the most you will see that most of what you do is make each other laugh.    ",13,15,0.0,28,0.0,0.0,0.0,28.0

I was determine to wait @CAPS see if my hero would ever reply.... My hero is amazing, lighting, astounding; his name is @PERSON. I understand his music.  My best friend @PERSON @CAPS I, would always talk about how awesome his music is; in fact @CAPS @CAPS started because of @ORGANIZATION. We were two different people; I didn'@CAPS even think we could be friends, or have anything in common. @CAPS' music brought us together.  @CAPS @CAPS I wrote a @CAPS to @LOCATION; I thought to myself ""@PERSON is not even going to look at it,"" but I watched @PERSON write the @CAPS. Weeks @CAPS weeks past by @CAPS I really thought @ORGANIZATION wasn'@CAPS going to read or reply. After that @CAPS @CAPS started to dilapidated. I felt discourage; we only talked about @PERSON @CAPS @CAPS photography project. We were really procrastinating toward @CAPS project; I had been a little distracted with cheer-leading @CAPS homework form the high school; not college homework. I was ignoring @PERSON calls @CAPS texts. Until I realize I had made a wrong choice; @CAPS I called my friend @PERSON--thank god I did. A week later @PERSON @CAPS I @CAPS two of my friends: @PERSON, my best friend since seventh grade; @LOCATION, my best friend since eighth grade, had went to watch this really vehement movie. After the movie we went to meet up with some friends at the dorms. On @CAPS way there, @PERSON @CAPS I were telling @PERSON @CAPS @PERSON about @CAPS amazing experience in health: @CAPS health teacher had given us an assignment about what a perfect body should look like. @PERSON @CAPS I, facetious made an alien-looking body. The toes of this alien were coming out of its shoes @CAPS @CAPS alien had warts all over. We laughed non-stop, obviously we didn'@CAPS turn it in. When we arrived to the dorms, @CAPS @PERSON presented me to his friend @CAPS.J; @CAPS was a big fan of @ORGANIZATION. ""@CAPS."" @CAPS we played various games I notice @CAPS.J, had some warts on his hands, @CAPS when @CAPS took off his shoes; to put on his saddles, I couldn'@CAPS help but notice @CAPS somewhat reminded me of @CAPS drawing.

I said ""In my eyes that's the perfect body."" We all had a good laugh @CAPS kept playing games @CAPS listening to @ORGANIZATION. The next day @PERSON @CAPS I had to meet, to work on @CAPS photography project. All we had to accomplish was to take pictures of each-other @CAPS the things that we like @CAPS dislike. It was called: getting to really know a person. I learned a lot about @PERSON threw this project. In my opinion, I sometimes live life to fast, @CAPS I can barely catch my breath. I want to do everything but school @CAPS sports sometimes held me back; not in a bad way. I just have less time to hangout with friends or simply rest. But I love my life @CAPS wouldn'@CAPS trade it; everything that I do gets me closer to my goal: @CAPS.B.I agent. This project was vehement.

I said "" @PERSON answer the phone!"" @CAPS @CAPS did. @CAPS said "" oh my god, @CAPS is @PERSON, I said ""stop messing around, now lets get back to work!"" @CAPS put his phone on speaker, @CAPS there it was; my hero on the phone!

12877,21503,8," On a hot @DATE day during the middle of @DATE and I were having a blast camping in @LOCATION. @PERSON and her family took me along on their camping trip we stayed in their @CAPS, our campsite was right by the ocean so we would go on daily walks there. We stayed in @LOCATION for a week. During that week, i believe on @DATE her older sister went into labor she lives in @LOCATION which is a pretty long drive from @LOCATION. That morning @PERSON's mom and dad woke us up very early in the morning around six thirty A.M, @PERSON and i had stayed up @TIME before until about three thirty in the morning so we were pretty tired at that point. We found out that we were going to take a little plane from @LOCATION to @LOCATION airport and we got it fairly cheap because @PERSON's brother works there. Sense we knew we had a long day ahead of us on only about three hours of sleep we both drank very strong coffee to keep us going. Then we were off to the airport the whole way there we were laughing about everything street signs, names of buildings, funny looking birds, songs, also we have @CAPS accents that we say every word with so it was that much funnier. My stomach muscles hurt so bad i don't know if we were laughing because things were actually funny or if we were delirious from not having much sleep and on top of that on a caffeine high and sugar rush. Once we got to the actual airport we still could not stop laughing @PERSON's parents were getting frustrated with us even though we were making them crack up also. We all boarded the plane and we sat next to each other of course. We swear still to this day that we had a secret agent sitting behind us he had on spy glasses, a suit and an ear piece @CAPS the secret agents wear that protect the president we kept making up stories about what he does we couldn't stop laughing. Finally he started to talk to us. We were very enthused he was telling us all the places he was going the place I remember the most is @LOCATION a secret agent! We knew it at this point. We thought how awesome of a job! Of course @PERSON's parents interrupted ""I'm sorry sir, are they bothering you?"" @CAPS we were some kind of pest, he replied ""of course not, i have nothing better to do."" We even had him laughing so hard that he was crying i guess you could say we are pretty funny when we are together. The best part was when her mom was having anxiety about flying i mean its not funny but she mad it funny because she was saying things such as ""oh my goodness were gonna crash, girls be quiet your freaking me out"" etc. @PERSON and I took advantage of the situation and made her even more scared. finally we landed. At the airport we went to the restroom and there was free toothbrushes so we took some @PERSON took a green one and I took a pink one. we used them all day in pictures and everything. Then we got a rental car and went to the hospital still laughing about everything we got into the hospital and finally seen the baby she was so cute. We started to settle down once we were in the room. After about an hour we went out to eat we were all so hungry. We ate then had to sit around and waste three hours we went to the mall then to @PERSON's family's house we crashed! @PERSON and I were dead! but we still had the flight home, dreading every step we didn't know how we were going to make it. Finally we got on the plane went back to camp and went to sleep. It was one of those ""had to be there"" days i cant put the emotion and laughter into words it was that funny.

12878,21505,8,"  Laughter to me is the best medicine there is, and indeed a big role in any good relationship. It's especially good for a couple who's serious and has forgotten how to laugh. Also for those who could use their mood lifted. I know that laughter made my relationship so much better.  In the begginging my relationship with my boyfriend wasn't so great. We barely laughed with eachother, let alone spoke very much. Only with friends would we laugh and have a good time. Though we weren't much of jokers anyway. All we could do was get upset or just not say anything. Even if the joke was funny.  Well that all changed one night when we decided to go to the @LOCATION and play a few rounds of @CAPS. When we got there we were kind of moody, and I was very short tempered. After we sat down the mood lightened a little. Then we finally got to talking and then one little outburst sent us practically rolling on the ground. We were cracking up. Faces red and gasping for air. We laughed so hard we almost cried, and the jokes didn't stop. Our moods totally changed once that happened. We couldn't even remember why we were upset. Almost like the anger just vanished.  Soon after we realized how rediculous we were and that it's alright to joke around, just so long as it's not mean. Later on we went to a friend's house and had an awsome time. We told a few good jokes, laughed an awful lot, and really had fun. Then when it got dark we decided to go home and were still cracking jokes. I don't know what it was about that night that but for the first time in a long time we were smiling and happy. Sharing that experience allowed us to really connect with eachother. Not only that, but it strenthened our bond, and brought us closer. Our relationship has been great ever since then. We can laugh and have a good time, without being so serious all the time. I know now why laughter is very important in a relationship.  Despite our little run in with moodiness, all that joking around reminded me that laughter is by far the best medicine there is. It did some things that others never could. Some @MONTH not think that laughing is best, but i believe it is. Those little giggles every now and then @MONTH not seem like much, but believe me there is so much more than you think. Laughter is everything to me. After what it did for me and my boyfriend, i don't know how i would live without it.    ",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12879,21506,8,"  I love laughing! Laughing makes me feel satisfied and happy. When I laugh with someone I don't know, I feel like I've known them for a long time. When I laugh with someone I do know, I feel fully content. But there is one person with whom I love to laugh with most of all, my cousin @PERSON. I think that laughing is an important part of our relationship because when we laugh, its magical. Magical as in how fast and @CAPS it takes to make one of us laugh. We will say almost anything, the most random but humorous things, then we will laugh until we literally cry.   One @TIME, when we were talking on the phone, we decided to call up our other cousin anonymously. When he didn't pick up we hung up disappointed. I was thinking of the @CAPS movie that I had just watched a few hours ago and an idea slowly started coming to me. I started talking in @CAPS to my cousin, pretending that I was our aunt from @LOCATION. I told her how I was coming over for a visit in the @DATE @CAPS they had better be prepared. I like my bed nice and soft, fluffy pillows, and my own bathroom. I was the picky aunt. I want everything perfect for when I come. We laughed and laughed. Then @PERSON says to me, ""@CAPS don't we call @CAPS again and if he doesn't pick up, we'll leave a message."" ""@CAPS will we say in the message?"", I asked. ""@CAPS'll just say that @CAPS're his aunt from @LOCATION and that @CAPS're coming for a visit and all the rest @CAPS'll just make up.""""@CAPS"", I said hesitantly. I dialed star six seven then his number and pressed talk.  Luckily, no one picked up. But when the answering machine beeped allowing me to record a message, I was speechless. Then I started in my high picky aunt voice, ""@CAPS @CAPS, this is your aunt @LOCATION and I..."" I burst out laughing before I could continue. ""I.. I'm coming over for a visit in.."", again I exploded. I could hear @PERSON laughing in the background, which made me laugh even harder. I tried again this time getting farther into the story laughing here and there. By the time I had reached the maximum amount of time for the message, I was @CAPS into it that I didn't want to stop. When the message ended, I was only half way done. @CAPS after the answering machine was done talking, I pressed two to here my message. As I listened, I couldn't help thinking about @CAPS a complete fool I sounded like. @PERSON kept shushing me each time I laughed to loud, but I could tell she wanted to laugh too. She was just holding it in. When I hung up, I called her back and when she answered I said, ""@CAPS do it again because I didn't finish.""@CAPS we called again and this time I said the rest more willingly and I barely laughed. I was saving it for when we listened to it.   When we had our fill of laughter and wiping tears, @PERSON said, ""That was the most hilarious thing we ever did together, we have to do it again sometime."" ""For sure"", I told her. But it was late into the @TIME, and time to go. When we had finished our good bye's and I love @CAPS's we hung up. That @TIME and every other time I laugh, I think @CAPS would it be like if no one could laugh. @CAPS a boring place this would be, @CAPS a lifeless life. When I laugh, I feel lively. I want to live to laugh another day. If there were no laughter, that would be a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.   ",25,20,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0
12880,21507,8," To me laughter shows the importance of life. I have always felt that in any situation whether @CAPS or bad laughter can completely change the way people handle those situations. When it comes to a relationship simply laughing can help anyone. Laughing symbolizes happiness and it is more than important for the people in a relationship to be happy. I have had many horrible situations where just laughing has helped us work through it. Laughing has always changed @CAPS mood and helped me through situations. When you get yourself so worked up about little things you forget about the @CAPS things in life and begin to lose your patients with each other, this has happened to me a lot. A time this happened to me was when me and @CAPS boyfriend were on our way to @LOCATION and it seemed like everything about that trip was going wrong. We went to @LOCATION for a vacation away from our hectic home life's and ended up wishing we were anywhere but where we were! They had over booked our hotel, our car broke down, @CAPS credit card account was being help for @NUM hours and it seemed as if that trip was the biggest mistake we had ever made. There was so much tension between us that we couldn't even look at each other without getting into a fight. We ended up going to some cheap hotel and spending the only cash we had. The next morning things got so bad that just being in the same room made us want to lash out and kill each other. He ended up leaving for the day and we didn't talk @TIME when he came back, but even when he got back after not being together or a day it was still hard being around each other. The next morning we woke up and by this time we were both fed up and have had more then enough. The only thing we did was mope around and fight, this made us realize we were really stuck and this vacation could no longer be called a vacation. There was no one we knew around to loan us money, no banks only an @CAPS and we realized we were not at our dream vacation destination more like in a nightmare. We had pretty much given up and lost faith in actually having a ""@CAPS vacation"" and had given up on each other. We were done, wanted nothing to do with each other or this nightmare anymore. This nightmare had ruined who we thought we were and we no longer looked at each other as a happy couple anymore, but more as two people who completely despised each other. The next day I decided to call @CAPS bank and see what was going on with @CAPS account, it turned out i forgot i changed @CAPS pin number to access @CAPS account. The entire time i kept entering the wrong pin so they locked @CAPS account to be sure someone was trying to break into it. I could not even describe how dumb I felt. I knew that as soon as I came back with the news even though it seemed like things would be alright, they wouldn't. When i arrived back at the hotel I could feel the tension as soon as I walked into the room. I began packing @CAPS stuff and when he caught on to what i was doing he asked where I was going, I replied ""to luxury"". Instantly his face lit up and he asked ""how"" and after I explained to him what had happened he instantly began laughing and hugged me. I knew as soon as i saw that smile on his face and heard laughter that things between us would be alright after all. We finally had the money to rent a car, and get to our dream destination. When we arrived at the hotel things were going great, we were smiling and laughing and actually enjoying ourselves. I can honestly say that even though all those horrible situations happened that I enjoyed our trip. I strongly believe that everything happens for a reason and that reason led us to a week full of laughter and true happiness.",20,16,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12881,21508,8," Laughter is necessary to survive in this crazy and beautiful world. It is something we possess with us throughout our lifetime. As humans, we grow old and eventually die, but laughter never does. It lives on forever. Laughter is often referred to as 'the best medicine', and why shouldn't it be? It brings joy to the sad, relief to the burdened, and life to the depressed. The best part about laughing is that it is completely and unchangeably free! Never will someone have to pay to gain a drop of laughter. On the other hand, laughter is also contagious. A single smile, throw back of a head, and a gut busting laugh can cause an entire room to become ill to this glorified epidemic. Laughter is the best release. When I was younger I had a neighbor named @ORGANIZATION. @PERSON was an older man who spent most of his time in his carpentering shop. He never talked to the rest of us on our street nor did we attempt to strike up a conversation with him. Day in and day out I would notice his little red pick-up leave in the morning and return at night. His life seemed like more of a routine and I was curious to find out why. @PERSON had a wife who, as well, became a vampire to the rest of us. This was completely fine, because to us, she was a monster. Countless times soccer balls would be kicked into her yard by pure accident and she would come out of her quiet house yelling and waving her hands in our direction. She even left a note on my family's front door telling them to ""take better care of your lawn"". I sympathized with @PERSON for having to live with the woman. Something in her voice seemed off, as if she was deaf. That aspect of her life always made me feel a little bad for her. Being different could have been a possible explanation to why she treated people the way that she did.  I will never forget the day the ambulance pulled up in front of their perfectly serene house. I sat on my front porch silently watching the medics go inside the house. Not long after, I heard the little red pick-up coming up the road. I knew, as far as everyone else on @ORGANIZATION, that this was not part of the routine. After about @NUM minutes, a body was carried out on a stretcher. My heart sank. Even though I was young, I knew the significance of a hovering white sheet over a being. @PERSON was very secluded after his wife passed away. Nobody could blame him for that. He lost the love of his life; he lost his routine. My family discussed and decided to bring him meals. The food was never anything particularly fancy, just something that would keep him going. I've never seen anyone so appreciative. Still, we knew to stay off of his lawn. His wife loved it and he must have felt like she was still attached to it somehow. He was lonely and my family wanted to be there for him. Soon after we brought over meals, my younger sister and I started walking his small, white, fluffy dog and invited him over for dinner as often as our mom would let us. He became more like a grandfather than a neighbor. One day, my friends and I were outside playing soccer on our small street. It was sunny and warm outside. Life was good. I could feel the vivacity of youth pulsing through my veins as I ran around. As of on its own, the ball rolled into @ORGANIZATION's yard. We all hesitated when we saw his door open. He looked pestered and quite upset as he slowly bent down to pick up our ball. I winced, knowing I'd hear about this later from my parents. Then the unexpected happened, @PERSON started laughing. The kind of laugh where a person might be considered crazy for being that happy. The kind of laugh where tears run down a person's face. Not knowing what to do, my friends and I started giggling to ourselves. @PERSON threw us the ball and went back inside. His laugh was a clear signal, @ORGANIZATION's grieving and unhappy soul had been relieved.  From then on, laughter has meant a great deal to me. Laughing can direct you straight to a person's soul. It can be the connection between people. Without laughter, life can seem dull. Once it is brought into your life, it has the powers to heal and restart. That is exactly what it did for @ORGANIZATION. Through laughter, he got his life back.",25,20,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0

So I called my mom on the home phone, and asked if my best friend @PERSON could come over. My mom said yes. I called my best friend @PERSON and tolled her what had happened, and asked her to come over. By this time I was crying my eyes out. @PERSON said yes to comeing over! @PERSON is my best friend in the whole world! She always knows what to do, and say when I'm upset.

I have always been there when all of @CAPS boyfriends had dumped her so it felt nice for her to be for me this time. I haven't had as any boyfriends as she had.

I didn't want to say it so I didn't. So started to talk and we desided to go to the mall. Thats always a fun place to be. So we ask my mom. She just got home. She said no. I really didn't want to be home anywhere was better any home at that time. So we went back to my room, I was crying again. So @PERSON started to say bad things about my ex-boyfriend.

To me, the best piece of a relationship is learning about one another and exploring the little things that make that person who they are. A trait I always search for is someones humor and when I can easily find it, I thrive on it. My story takes place nearly a year ago, while my freshmen school year was coming to an end. I had a suitcase of new memories I planned to carry with with me, but one more was still to be added. I strolled into art class merely @NUM seconds late on a particularly average day. The musty smell of rain and old paint settled in the air, something I had come accustom to. Instinct told me to take my seat, so with my headphones blocking the rest of the world out, I did. I paused my music to allow my surroundings to come into focus. A voice with a highly sarcastic tone came from in front of me. ""@CAPS to go! You're late."" @CAPS the teacher had moved all of our seats, I couldn't help but to laugh at myself as well. However, my seat remained unchanged, the only new aspect was the people sitting around me. I greeted the familiar faces with a smile as class began.  The teacher went on about art related topics that I was far beyond, so by habit I vaguely payed any attention. I was far more focused on the person sitting in front of me. I had never talked to this boy but there was something very intriguing about him. We barley said a few words on that day of class. As the next day approached, I continued my usual pattern of entering the room and sitting in the same place. It had slipped my mind that a stranger was going to sit in front of me. He turned into the room took his seat. @CAPS what I had forgotten made me excited. Today was a free work day, a time to be social and work at our own pace. Perfect opportunity for me to learn something not related to art. I casually introduced myself, trying to fit personality into my words. His introduction was far less enthusiastic. Him being uninterested made me thrive to try harder. I began to be myself and act as if I had known him for years, even though his name was brand new to me. It was then I had caught his interest and the conversations started flowing. By the end of that day I hadn't finished any of the work I was supposed to have, but I couldn't bring myself to care. I had just met such an alluring new person.  Each day went on similarly but I had taught myself a good balance of work and talk. I couldn't get enough of this person I had just let into my life. Everything he said interested me and each word pulled me in. I'm positive everyone in the room knew of how funny I found him because of how often my laughter filled the room. It didn't take long for me to become very attached to him and each hysterical thing he said. After a couple weeks, the hour of class wasn't enough for us, and he made the decision to give me a call. I intrigued him as well. So our time spent talking didn't stop at the end of the school day but spilled over into our phone conversations. More time passed and it became a usual thing to talk with him often. I no longer needed to act as if I had known him for years. It was well over a month and a half into our relationship when comfort was starting to set in for me. Although, along with familiarity came a sense of question. I was beginning to very well open up to him but was not getting the same in return. I would tell him something of my past and he would make a joke of it; I would explain an opinion of mine and he would pretend to have the same. I had never laughed so much in such a short amount of days, but it was coming time to feel more then pretend hysteria. I wanted to be able to tell him personal things, but get something from him too. I began to realize I was digging deep into shallow waters.  The amount of laughter in this relationship of mine was clouding my judgment of the person underneath the humor. I couldn't connect with him on anything more then simple things. I still wished to have him be apart of my life, to still enjoy his company, but I had no need to dig deeper. It was time for me find new waters to swim in.",23,20,0.0,43,0.0,0.0,0.0,43.0
12884,21511,8," One day on a stormy night i had gone to the wood shed to get some wood. The wind was thrashing the trees and all of the coyotes in the distance were barking to the moon. I was taking one piece at at time trying to make sure that the pile would not fall on me. As I watched my step i lost my footing on a small cylindrical log about a foot long and hit my head. My brother came out to find out what was taking me so long and arrived to my body unconscious. He took me into the shop which is connected to the woodshed out of the cold and turned on the furnace to keep me warm. In doing so he accidentally locked the door from the outside which locked him and me in the shop. As I woke up from my faint sleep with a splitting headache all i could remember happening was the rain pounding against the side of the woodshed. @CAPS was sitting next to me with a sad look on his face and also some shock as well. He told me what had happened with the door getting locked and how we would never get out till morning. I looked around trying to find something to get the door off but couldn't find out what anything was. My parents could not hear us over the storm since they were asleep and we were helpless no matter what we tried. So instead of looking on the gloomy side we decided to make some stories and tell jokes to pass the time till it was morning again. As we made up a game called @CAPS we found that we had a lot of similar interests and also we laughed at the same jokes. as we laughed the time seemed to fly by as if we were in a time warp. after three hours it seemed that we were both getting hungry and i had a couple snacks in my pockets. so we sat by the furnace and ate and told jokes about our friends and our parents and the laughing kept us cheered up for another three hours. After a while we started to hear the storm start to leave the sky like a ghost leaving this world to the next life. We started making fun of different movies and they're actors and actresses. I started talking about how big @PERSON's ears were and we both started cracking up with laughter uncontrollably he then came back to me with how big @ORGANIZATION's lips were and i laughed so hard i couldn't breath. we looked through the holes in the shop to see the morning dew on the grass and birds chirping in trees and i knew it wouldn't be long before we were found. As we waited for our parents to come find us we looked at each other and said thank you. We both knew by saying that it wasn't meant for all the times I tried to get us out of the shop or for @CAPS pulling me into the shop, no it was for the time we spent together and laughed. It made us closer than we already were and it also gave us a memory of laughter that we spent together instead of a night of disaster and horror. We have cherished that memory ever since it happened even though we @MONTH fight over the most tiny inconsiderate things sometimes and make fun of each other, we know that deep down we do it out of love.

12886,21513,8,"                       Laughter   @CAPS is like a drug that works better than any other painkiller, or anti-depressant out there. It makes angry people happy, and happy people ecstatic. One of the best ways and more common ways to have a good laugh is by watching a funny movie. Any time I'm asked @CAPS's your favorite comedy I say ""@CAPS with @PERSON"". I remember the first time I watched a @PERSON movie. I was about @NUM years young; I was in second grade, it was towards the end of the school year, and I couldn't wait to get out for the @DATE and just have fun. It was any ordinary boring day @CAPS school and I remember walking home hoping there would be something fun to do when I got home. I walked in the door to see my brother watching @CAPS, I asked him @CAPS he was watching but he just ignored me so I went to my room to do homework. I finished my homework and walked into the living room and plopped down on the couch next to my brother, I asked @CAPS he was watching a second time, he let out an annoyed sigh and said some movie called ""@CAPS @CAPS"" was about to start. Within the first five minutes we were already @CAPS, not just giggling or slightly chuckling, tears were rolling down our faces from all the @CAPS. I remember saying to my brother ""@CAPS is the funniest movie I've ever seen!"" @CAPS the end of the movie my brother and I couldn't stop quoting the movie, every @NUM seconds we'd quote it, it was non stop laughter. We sat there on the couch patiently waiting to see @CAPS was on next wishing and hoping it was another movie as incredible as the one we just watched, and sure enough after the commercial break we learned that it was a @PERSON marathon, and on next was ""@CAPS @CAPS"". The movie started out just as funny as the last one, with @PERSON doing something completely idiotic, yet absolutely hilarious, like growling @CAPS some dogs over a loudspeaker. We couldn't get enough of @CAPS guy, my brother was rolling on the floor @CAPS and crying, and I was still watching waiting to see @CAPS happened next. About half way through the movie my mom got home from work, she walked in to see my brother and I in hysterics, she said ""@CAPS's so funny?"" We just pointed @CAPS the @CAPS right as @PERSON started rolling down a hill. Soon enough our mom was watching it too, @CAPS just as hard as we were. I was having a great time, a genuinely great time with my family, @CAPS more could I ask for? How about another @PERSON movie? On next was a movie called ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS"", completely ridiculous, and completely hilarious, @CAPS's funnier than an overweight guy trying to be a @CAPS? We continued to watch the movie until dinner time, we inhaled our food as fast as we could and then raced back to the couch to continue watching. When it was time for bed I remember staying up late reciting quotes from the movie in our bunk beds until our mom came in and told us to be quiet. I don't know how we slept @CAPS all after @CAPS all night. The movies left us speechless, we had never seen @CAPS funnier, they made us laugh, they made us cry, they made our stomachs ache, and through it all it brought my brother and I closer. To @CAPS day my brother and I can sit down and watch one of those movies and laugh and remember all the times we have watched them before and all the laughs we shared, I swear half of my childhood consisted of @CAPS, and @PERCENT of that @CAPS came from those movies. The movies helped me to develop a funny personality, they shaped @CAPS I think is humorous, and they make me realize that after sharing something so funny with someone I love, that laughter is an important aspect in our lives, without it life would be plain and dull like a meaningless blob of clay. Have you ever gone a day without @CAPS? If so you know how long and dull it can get without having something that brings a smile to your face there. Laughter brings people together, it brings out the best in us, when you're mad or upset the best way to cure your anger or frustration is by having a good laugh.     ",18,19,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12887,21514,8," I think laughter should be a huge part in everyoneas life. For examlpe; laughter has brought my mother and I closer than we have ever been before. One time we were sitting in her camper and we had not been with each other for a whole month so we just let everything out, and laughing was one of the things. We were laughing about fake teeth, we laughed so hard that I made my mom tinkle her pants. We talked about fake teeth for about an hour. I think laughing makes everyone feel better about themselves, it does me. Laughing is a good way to show someone that you know how to have fun and it's not a bad thing. For someone to know how to laugh and to have fun is a good way to start a friendship or even a relationship. Another example is; @CAPS I'm with all of my friends I can never stop laughing, and I love it because I'm not sad. @CAPS I was a little girl my family and I went to disneyland and it was the beast time of my life there was not one moment @CAPS I was not laughing with all of them. One thing I don't understand is how someone couldn't be laughing or smiling at least @CAPS someone says or does something funny. Well back to my story of my mother and I, We were all tired and had a long day and fake teeth just made us all laugh, and laugh it was the best time I think I have ever ahd with my mother. I have always said to everyone I know ""live life while you can you don't know how long you'll have it."" I think that those words are very true and while your living life, laugh. My grandfather is pretty funny to @CAPS he is in a good mood he is always making everyone around him laugh. One time he had seen this commercial and it was a plastic grandpa singing ""I'm not your daddy I'm your grandpa"" and it said that maybe four times, and ever since he heard that he sings it all over the house. In conclusion laughing is the best way to feel better about anything. So @CAPS your blue just think about something that will always make you laugh and laugh about it.",15,19,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12888,21515,8,"      Well since you guys want to hear a funny story, I got a couple but I'm only going to tell you about one of them. This one starts in my @DATE. I was living out in @LOCATION and it gets pretty hot in the @DATE. I lived there a couple summers @CAPS I know how hot it gets. This @DATE I wanted to get a pool for the fun and to stay cool. But I didn't want a pool that just I could hangout in. I wanted to get a really nice pool for everyone. I already knew that those kind costed a bunch of money but, I wanted to get a big pool @CAPS I could have all my friends come over , hangout , swim and play my favorite game mar-co polo.I went to go talk to my dad about my pool idea. He said ""that he would love to get a pool for the @DATE"" cause he would come in and swim with me and hangout but, like I was saying @CAPS are expensive and @NUM exactly what my dad said. I told him that I would pay for half of what ever it costed. My dad finally agreed with me @CAPS we go down to walmart and look at there pools. There was some cheap small ones and there was a lot of huge expensive ones but, I was looking for one right in the middle, not to small , and not to much money. I found one for eight hundred that was perfect for what I wanted. I went to go asked my dad if I could get this one. He said ""that if I pay for four hundred of it like the original deal that i could get it"". Like I told him @NUM what I said I was going to do and @NUM what i needed to do"". We finally came to an agreement that we had to get the money first , @CAPS I went back to my house in @LOCATION to make a plan to get four hundred dollars, my dad was doing the same, but he has a job @CAPS its not that hard for him cause he gets paid. @NUM a lot harder on me cause I have no job. @CAPS I decided to fix my bike and go looking around for any jobs available. I went door to door to find people that needed any help around there house. I found a couple of people who needed some stuff done and @CAPS both agreed to pay me fifty bucks, @CAPS out of each I could get a hundred right off the bat.I had to haul a bunch of old tree branches and garbage away. When I was done I put that money in my pool savings for later. I also went to this place called @ORGANIZATION and I was good friends with one of the kids that was related to them. I talked to him about him asking them if I could do any work for a little cash. @CAPS said that ""I could go to every tree and put a pink tag on him and @CAPS agreed to give me eighty five bucks. I took there deal but, my bike can't go threw the mud where the trees were planted. My friend said that ""I could barrow his little fifty dirt bike and take it to put those tags on the trees"". @CAPS I borrowed it and got that eighty five bucks. I gave my friend ten cause he let me borrow his dirt bike.I'm almost half way to my four hundred. When I was thinking, I got @CAPS caught up in buying this pool that I forgot my birthday was coming up tomorrow. I told my dad that I wanted that pool for my birthday and @NUM like ""yeah I already knew that @CAPS I already bought it"". I was @CAPS happy that I got my pool.

Luckily @PERSON@NUM dad is rich, @CAPS he bought me another pool. He seen how crushed I was on my birthday and because he knew I wanted that pool. He also bought me a new bike and it was sick.

Laughter is what created what has been one of the most important relationships in my life thus far. Laughter is what unifies us, it gives each of us something in common despite our differences. This has been proven true in my life, especially with one person, @CAPS. I met @CAPS a year ago in a class of mine, we never really talked much or knew each other until that one day when she @CAPS me laugh. It was juts another day in class doing a lab when I see this short ginger hair girl twitching on a bar stole, I of course immediately begin to laugh. This girl was twitching around on a stole making awkward hand gestures and laughing, making me crack up, and not a single other person finds this funny, they are just giving us the you girls are insane"" stare. Others inquire what she is doing, @CAPS too hysterical to form actual words, I say ""hello dudes she is a dinosaur like from @CAPS the @CAPS, 'I have a bid head and little arms.... I don't think this plan was though out very well....'"" @CAPS response with a point to me and a head shake, I knew this was the beginning a beautiful, laughter filled, @CAPS.  There are countless times where laughter was been the center piece of my time with @CAPS. When we are hanging out it seems that we effortlessly humor not only ourselves but others even the complete stranger. The best example I can give is when we were at @ORGANIZATION, a hotel with an in door water park, for my birthday with two of our best friends. Our time there had already been full of laughs, pictures and a good time, but when we were all dressed up looking your something to do was the high light of the @TIME. Two nights of no sleep, loads of sugar, and energy drinks @CAPS our little foursome more insane than usual, giving @CAPS the courage to saunter up to very attractive complete stranger and get him to say hello to the birthday girl, me. @CAPS and I start to bust a move and proceed to fall to the ground in laughter, at this point most people would think these @NUM girls are strange I am leaving now, but this guy was entertained by our laughter even he joined in on the laughter. Perhaps the best memory of @CAPS's contagious laughter was when we went to see @CAPS to @CAPS your @CAPS, believe me when I say this night could have easily down hill very quickly. Basically @CAPS was yelling at the movie, cracking, jokes, texting, making us laugh, so all the things that get you kicked out of a movie and make the people around you angry. But for some reason the people around us ate up her humor and found it hilarious, they were laughing along with us. It was one of the best nights at the movies I have ever had, I have never been on such an adventure. They way laughter has impacted my life is by giving me this amazing best friends who is crazy and humorous. @CAPS is one of those people who makes you realize that laughter is what unifies us and is something to do. So go ahead, act like your @NUM even if your @NUM, you never know who you @MONTH make laugh and what friends you could make.""",17,18,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0

That morning we all woke up early and packed everything in the car. My dad and brother did most of the work while us girls got ready. After everything was packed we were off to @LOCATION. @LOCATION is a small little town surrounded by mountains with absolutely nothing but a couple of houses, a park, a river, and forests all around you.

It had a wood stove in one corner, bunk beds fulfilling almost half the cabin, and a counter that was always messy with all the food and supplies that we would bring. The whole ride over we were all messing with each other giving one another horse bits, the claw, and pulling on other peoples seat belts so that it would tighten across there chest. We were also telling @PERSON funny stories about one another trying to embarrass them. When we got on the gravel road my dad started making the car slide back and fourth scarring @CAPS.

12891,21518,8," Laughter is almost always a good thing, mainly because when people laugh it means their happy or something is funny. It can be very beneficial at times, for instance when someone is not feeling to happy people always try to make them laugh to make them feel better. When I am faced with someone I don't know usually my first instinct is to try to and them laugh. laughter has always been a source of enjoyment and it still is today, We have certain advantages now than we had one hundred years ago. For instance now @CAPS we want to laugh we need only to pick up remote and turn on the @CAPS, we can even choose what we want to laugh at and we even have the ability to go and search for something to laugh at on the internet. Sometimes people go to comedy clubs to go and see a stand up comedians. Comedy and laughter go hand in hand, from the very first time someone laughed comedy was born and will be around forever unless being happy becomes outlawed. I remember that when ever my parents would have a new friend over then only thing I would hear when they were at my house was then sound of both my parents and our new guest laughing. Soon the new guest was over much more often.  Laughing is also a very important part of any relationship because it makes the person whom is making the other laugh more of a pleasure to be around and thus makes them sometimes like them more, @CAPS you have ever noticed men usually try to make the women laugh in order to try to get that member of the opposite sex to like them. This and the accompanying of physical attraction help start the relationship. I have herd but am not certain that laughter can also be therapeutic, sometimes I like to laugh when I'm not felling so good so it @MONTH possibly be therapeutic for me. @CAPS this is so than people have been going through therapy for many years. Sometimes people laugh even @CAPS the subject is not funny they only do this because otherwise the situation would be somewhat awkward and one might fell kind of out of place. Everyone has a different laugh some are louder than others and some have a type of rhythm to them, my mother has a very loud and high pitched laugh and my grandpa has a low and scratchy laugh, no matter what your laugh is like it can help you feel better it can also help you become closer to someone. laughing is just one of life's greatest pleasures and we should all take a chance to just sit and laugh.",19,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

Some @MONTH say that a library is not a funny place but to my best friend @PERSON and I it was full of numerous and humerous adventures. There was the time with the creepy, stalker guy whom we like to call @CAPS @CAPS, the time that we decided to be super spies, and the different people who decided that we were to loud and weren't to nice about telling us. We worked hard in that library but who says you can't laugh a little on the job?  @CAPS @CAPS, by definition it means he is some one who likes to @CAPS, but @CAPS guy was just to funny. One day @PERSON and I had just got done working and we were waiting for her grandma to pick us up, when some strange guy sits down and starts staring at @ORGANIZATION like he knew her. He then preceded to ask us countless questions like, ""@CAPS your names?"" and ""@CAPS you guys have boyfriends?"". Being me I didn't say a word and let @PERSON talk the whole time. He also kept telling us how beautiful we were, which made us laugh even harder because @CAPS situation just kept getting weirder and weirder. Since his nickname is @CAPS @CAPS you can only guess @CAPS he asked us next. Oh yes he asked us if we wanted to start a @CAPS line in the middle of the library. Thankfully @PERSON's grandma showed up just in time to save us and we only saw the @CAPS @CAPS once or twice after that because he moved away shortly after @CAPS encounter. Being a spy was one of the most hardest and funniest things that @PERSON and I ever did at the library. It all started when we noticed @CAPS cute guy sitting all by himself at a table that we could clearly see through some book shelves not that far away. Being the adventurous type I talked @PERSON into letting me use her iPhone to take pictures of @CAPS guy without him knowing. Now some people would think that that was kind of like a stalker, I just saw as a chance to brush up on my spy skills. After successfully getting a couple of pictures undetected, I decided to get just one more before we went back to the other side of the library to see @CAPS we had. I was just about to take the picture when I locked eyes with the guy who was not supposed to see me. We then had to abort the mission and crawl all the way to the other side of the library so he wasn't able to see us again, so that he couldn't confront us about why we were taking pictures of him. The funny thing is the pictures were not that good and that just shows how bad of a spy we actually were. Normally libraries are quiet, right? Well @PERSON and I had a little problem with people wanting the library to be to quiet. On one such occasion a nice looking middle aged women was doing some homework at a table not to far away form where we were sitting. We were watching some videos on @ORGANIZATION's iPhone and we had the speakers on low. @CAPS lady told us very rudely that she wanted is to move somewhere else if we were going to have the volume up because she needed to get her work done. Not one please or thank you were said as we walked away. On a similar occasion an elderly lady who was sitting a few book shelves away form us also asked us to be quiet so that she could finish her book. @CAPS time the elderly lady used her manners but she had a very rude tone of voice. On both of these occasions @PERSON and I started laughing shortly afterward. @CAPS just goes to show how ""nice"" people can be when they want to get something done. All and all that @DATE was one of the most funniest summers I have ever had. Whether we were getting talked to by some guy who wanted to start a @CAPS line or getting caught trying to spy on a cute guy or even getting reprimanded by not so nice people, we could always find @CAPS somewhere.

Her daughter, @PERSON, safely tucked away in bed. ""@CAPS girls!"" @CAPS exclaimed, ""@CAPS's @PERSON?""  ""@CAPS on the field watching the shower with her real friends"" I said, making air quotations with my fingers.  @PERSON rolled her eyes and re gripped her pillow and blankets. ""@CAPS! @PERSON, can we sleep in here tonight?""  ""@CAPS!"" @PERSON said, ""@CAPS in and lock the door behind @CAPS.""  We walked in to the trailer and locked the door. As we plopped down on the beds @PERSON made some chocolate milk. ""@CAPS, ladies!"" @PERSON started out, handing us each a glass full to the brim with delicious milk, ""I want to know the good gossip! Why is everyone mad at @ORGANIZATION?""  ""@CAPS is mad at me because your daughter likes me more."" @PERSON said, shrugging and taking a long draw of her drink. ""@CAPS is that."" I said, ""@CAPS the other part is a long story. So yesterday I was talking to her about @PERSON. @CAPS know cute core-guy @PERSON?"" they nodded, ""@CAPS I told her about a conversation @CAPS and I had @CAPS I told a @CAPS stupid joke and out of pity @CAPS laughed and said 'that's cool' I was @CAPS excited and @CAPS was laughing at me because i was jumping up and down.""  ""That doesn't sound mean."" @PERSON stated. ""@CAPS! @CAPS then went on to tell me that @PERSON doesn't, and never will, like me. @CAPS said that @CAPS just thinks am stupid and feels sorry for me."" I was almost shouting, ""I mean out loud I agreed with her @CAPS in my head i was scream furiously @CAPS loves me! We are gonna get married someday!! I decoded his words with my heart!!"" I slammed my palm against my chest and pretended to cry. Then I couldn't help @CAPS laugh. All three of us were laughing hysterically at my faked passion. ""@CAPS should right skits for @CAPS!"" @PERSON said, gasping between fits of laughter. Suddenly @PERSON stopped laughing and said, ""I @CAPS want some coleslaw! Random @CAPS!""  ""I could go for some coleslaw right about now."" @PERSON shrugged. ""I could go for some @PERSON-slaw right about now!"" I said, smiling. Instantly new laughter erupted from everyone. I thought about how much humor this story would lose every time i retold it in the future. Some how I knew that I couldn't do it the justice it deserved. The laughter started to settle. We sipped our milk quietly, thinking. As we did i looked out the window to see @PERSON walking our way from across the field. With a groan I got up to unlock the door. ""@CAPS it!"" @PERSON said, ""and turn off the light. Anyone who hate my @NUM year old daughter doesn't need to be here."" I flicked out the light and made my way @CAPS to the bed. @PERSON got to the door and tried the handle. When @CAPS found that it was locked @CAPS softly knocked on the door. Then @CAPS waited. We stuck our faces in pillows to muffle our uncontrollably laughing. Giving up, @CAPS walked away through the gravel. We all burst out laughing, unable to control ourselves. Looking at the clock, @PERSON gasped, it was @NUM in the morning and @CAPS would be starting in @NUM hours. It was time to get some sleep. @PERSON went @CAPS to her bed while @PERSON and I said our good-nights and rolled over. The trailer went quiet. Laying @CAPS I thought about the happiness created by us. I knew that @ORGANIZATION would be @CAPS. @CAPS her being mad was worth what I learned. That @TIME I found out that if your happiness makes someone mad, that's @CAPS fault. Be happy and enjoy life! Anger is bred from the joy of others. So why not be @CAPS? It beats the alternative, doesn't it?",18,20,0.0,38,0.0,0.0,0.0,38.0
12894,21522,8," It was the middle of @DATE and I was ten, bored and constantly sleeping. Even at ten I still played with toys, and that was the highlight of most days. All of my friends from fifth grade were on vacation surfing in @LOCATION, or roasting marshmallows over the roaring fire with their families at camp, while I was stuck at home with nothing to do. That was about to be the most boring @DATE break anyone has ever had until one day in @DATE. The day I met @PERSON was the day I gained my best friend. I met @PERSON because of my brother and his sister, they had had crushes on each other and wanted to start dating. That was fine with our parents but, that also meant that her brother @PERSON, and I, would have to tag along also. I remember the first day being so uncomfortable and stiff. I could tell he didn't like me, he only chuckled when I would crack a joke here an there. As time went on though, I must have grew on him, because a few days later he was laughing at practically every joke I made.  Those jokes had eventually led up to a friendship that would last a lifetime. Which really started when his birthday had come up in late @DATE. He was having a small overnight birthday party which included me, his family, and his good friend @CAPS. @CAPS couldn't stay overnight, so it was just me and @PERSON. I didn't get much sleep at all that night, but that was fine with me because why i hadn't was a good enough reason not to.  We spent half the night talking, and laughing, and really just getting to know each other better. Anyone with eyes could see that we were becoming close friends. Even after our siblings separated from each other we would still hang out as just us two. The real test of our friendship took place shortly after his birthday when @PERSON, and his family moved to @LOCATION, where they were from. After they moved I still had contact with him and we talked to each other frequently. They had been gone for about a year when I got a call from @PERSON, telling me that they were going to move back.  I had so many questions that needed to be answered, but he had a really bad connection and the call was dropped quickly after I heard him say that. With many things left unsaid my overall emotion was obviously happy, but also slightly confused. Was he really coming back? That was the question that kept me wondering. It was days after that I had gotten another call from him, and this time we actually had a chance to talk. It was true, he was coming back, but as it turns out not forever. @PERSON came back for about another solid @NUM years, having fun and being the best of friends, but his parents already wanted to move back to @LOCATION again. This time was different because he wasn't coming back. He was going to stay there, without a thought of going back. @PERSON had left my life as quickly as he entered. He's halfway across the country now, with new friends and a renewed life, probably laughing at a new friend's jokes.",20,18,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12895,21525,8," Laughter can be a good think and sometimes it could be a sad thing. When me and my family went to @LOCATION we went for my two little brothers appointment. We left a little early so we could have some vacation time. When we arrived to where were going we got onto a fairy to go to a island up in @LOCATION. On are way there my sister @PERSON was acting like she was on the titanic she had the dress and everything. My brothers and dad and i just couldn't stop laughing at her because she is eighteen. @CAPS while we stayed down there we were at are uncles house and they have a little dog and she was running from it and she fell so hard and my family and i weren't trying to laugh at her but it's kinda hard. After we went to lunch with are uncle and aunt we went to there military base @PERSON would not keep here hands off of the jets. What my family and i thought was so funny is @PERSON is eighteen and the rest of us are fourteen or younger so i guess we just like to pick on @LOCATION. When we went to @LOCATION it was the night before the boy's appointment and are family and us went to the under ground tour of @LOCATION. Well after that was all done we went to the gift shop that come's up at the end of the tour well @PERSON buys a pin that said something no so good and after she bought it are @CAPS had seen it she threw it away because she doesn't like things like that but @PERSON pulled out of the trash. After that all of us got hungry so we went to this place where they sale some really @CAPS tacos and we got a order and we sat down well we also got some sodas and my other sister and i took a bite of are food and took a drink of are food @CAPS @PERSON says ""oh my gosh there are two really hot guys right there"" @CAPS sierra take the biggest gulp of tapattao and i don't remember what @PERSON said but she said something and it made me and sierra bust up laughing and we spit are food all over @LOCATION she gets up and screams. So of course are parents and family don't want to be there anymore because we embarrassed them so we all started to walk up to the car and right when are uncle @PERSON yelled @PERSON don't fall because thins is where i fell all you hear is are sister falling behind us is was so funny. What made it even more funny was that me and sierra just started to stop laughing and oh my goodness we were laughing the whole way to the car. Are whole way home @PERSON was mad at us because we were still laughing at her but we went to the beach she was over it. I think when we went to the beach that was the place where we started to bond a lot more because we were all playing no cell phones lots of picture rock climbing that was fun we left @PERSON and my brother @CAPS behind a couple of times @CAPS @PERSON tried to keep throwing me into the water so i would pushed him back @CAPS @PERSON threw a rock at @LOCATION and she fell over. When we were all taking a picture on a @CAPS log we were all shaking it and @PERSON sierra and i all fell of and i hurt my arm so we had to go to the doctors. A month after we got home are @CAPS took @PERSON, sierra, aunt @PERSON and i to @CAPS on ice and that was probably the best time of my life. Are @CAPS says ""i don't know what's funnier @PERSON waving to the actors on the ice that cant see her in the dark or the show."" @CAPS are aunt said""yeah thank you @CAPS for making me sit next to her."" @CAPS when the cartoon toys story came on sierra and i said""look @PERSON what are you doing on the ice arena and she thought that we were talking about the pig and we were all no the little troll and @CAPS and aunt @PERSON just busted up laughing it was hilarious. When we went home we were all talking about it and laughing and she got mad because were always making fun of her because she is short but when it comes to us she thinks its so funny. There is a lot of laughter in our family and i cant wait to have more in it so that when i grow up I'll have a lot of good memories beside me and I'll still look back like i am now and I'll say wow what good times i have had since i grew up. When we are family laughs together i think that is the time when we actually communicate",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12896,21526,8," I have a friend and her name is @PERSON. I have known her since we were both in the fifth grade and in the same class. We have been friends for about five to six years now and it has been a great friendship. About two years ago for her fifteenth bithday party she invited a couple of her friends and I to spend the day over at her dads house in @LOCATION. The plan was to hang out, have fun ,and pretty much do whatever we wanted to do because it was her birthday. There was a pool to swim in, and flatscreen television to watch movies, plenty of board games top go around, and quite a few people to have a conversation with. On the morning of @DATE we all loaded up the car around noon and made our way to her dads appartment in @LOCATION. A short @NUM minutes later we had arrived at the appartment complex. We were all so excited to get the entire day to hang out, and have an amazing sleepover for @ORGANIZATION's birthday. The second that the van had stopped all five of the people that were in the car including me unbuckled our seat belts as fast as we could and got up out of the seats to head to the house. Everybody had gotten there seatbelt unbuckled except for @CAPS friend @PERSON. She had thought she heard, and felt the seatbelt button click to release it, but it never disengaged. While the seat belt was still on she attempted to jump up out of her seat but at the last second the seatbelt caught her by the waste and jerked her back down to her spot. She had layed there with her arms to her sides with her head all the way back against the head rest and moaned for a good ten seconds. This was one of the many events of laughter that had happened that day.  A good two hours had gone by and the five of us were chillin' out in the living room and talking about what to do next. @PERSON had suggested ""@CAPS guys, we should all go to the pool for a couple of hours, swim, and tan."" The rest of us were all for it concidering the fact that it was probably one hundred degrees outside, the weather was super sunny, and clear, and because it was @CAPS @PERSON birthday, and she should be able to do whatever she wants. Then after the conversation we all got our swim suites on, grabbed our towls, and whatever else we needed for the pool, and headed out the door. Little did we know but the blacktop outside was boiling! Of course we were all barefoot because we were just going to go jump in the pool anyways. We all then took one step out on the blacktop, and all you could here was screaming, and yelling. ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS! @CAPS feet are on fire!"" @PERSON remarked. We had all agreed with her at that very moment of time. Since the blacktop was outrageously hot @PERSON started running for the grass that was about two hundred feet away. I would say thirty seconds later @PERSON had finally reached the grass and all we heard was. ""@CAPS!"" all of us looked up at @LOCATION. She was laying flat on her back because the sprinklers had been on recently and she didnt know so her feet flew right out in front of her and landed on her back. We all started laughing but running at the same time. I helped @PERSON get up off of the ground and then we all continued our journey to the pool. I think you can guess that something else funny happened with @PERSON.",20,19,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

We all were having fun daily because it was like my brother didn't have rules any more this made him a lot more fun to be around. At the beginning of the @DATE my brother and I were going fishing almost daily with our friends. It was a very fun for all of us. We all got to hang out and stay connected because there is nothing ells to do in our small town except for go to the lake and fish for bass.   @CAPS he graduated everyone close to the family gave him gifts like money or presents. My mother however couldn't decide what she wanted to get him. @CAPS she saw us always going up to the lake to go bass fishing she had an idea, she would send my brother and a couple of his friends on a fishing trip. My brother was very excited to here her plan. They spent many hours searching for a place for him and his friends to travel to. They decided on going into the deserts of @LOCATION to a huge lake to camp at.  I myself thought this was a very cool plan and i was happy for my brother. Little had I known my brother was planing on taking me with him. He told me his plans of who he would be taking a couple weeks before it was time to depart. I was so excited! My brother said we would be taking our friend @PERSON on the trip with us witch was cool because he is a fun person to be around. He was so so happy @CAPS we told him he was going because he loves bass fishing more than us.   Immediately @PERSON ran out to the garage to get his camping and fishing gear ready for the trip as did we @CAPS we got home that night. Two weeks later we all departed for a two week trip to the deserts of eastern @ORGANIZATION. The first day we were in eastern @ORGANIZATION before we even found the place we were going to stay at we went to a huge reservoir to go fishing. @PERSON almost caught a huge @NUM inch bass however his line on his fishing rod broke. My brother and I laughed at him and he was mad.  We spent the first night on the side of the road in the near freezing dry @LOCATION air because we had accidentally gone a day early and our camp sight was occupied in the campground. We were unhappy about it at the time but now we look back on that night with great laughter. The next few days went by with much fun. We met some collage students from @ORGANIZATION, they were very chill people to hang out with we all joined around the camp fire and told jokes. We laughed for probably a half an hour @CAPS one of the guys told us about some funny collage party things that had happened. @CAPS @DATE was a very interesting @DATE that was full of laughter and joy.

12898,21530,8," Laughter, one of the most joyous things there is to experience in this world. Everyone can relate to it and there's no one out there who would say that they don't enjoy laughing. It's human nature to want and to need to be connected to other people; we are social beings, and laughter is the best way to connect to other people. There is no negativity in laughing, unless that is if you are laughing at a rude comment, and in general, if people are laughing, they would say they're having a good time. People build relationships around experiences that they have with other people, for example dating. On a first date, it's to be expected, and an important factor, for the two people to be having fun and laughing. Other wise, when they separate from each other and are only left with their thoughts, their impression could make or break the relationship. That's why a first impression is so important. When the two people are reminiscing about the date that they just had, if they remember smiling and laughing, then they will most likely have a positive memory of their experience and want to hang out again. Think about any experience you have ever had with another person. If you remember the first time you met them, and how you felt afterward, the way you felt then, could tell you a lot about how the relationship went. Meeting new people, it's difficult, but you ask anyone about how to start a conversation with someone new, and they will usually tell you, ""make them laugh"". It's a universal term, anyone can do it. This past month, basketball season has started and I am playing on a whole different team then I did last year. Only half the girls on my team last year are still here, and I have had to make a connection with girls who are younger then me, and who I haven't yet gotten to know. I start to think about all the new girls, and who I have already made connections with and how I'm now good friends with most of them because of laughter. Everyday we get closer and closer because we find ways to laugh with each other out on the court. No matter how difficult the practice @MONTH get, you can never become to exhausted when someone is making you laugh. Laughter is needed in life to make it more livable. Think about it. If you could never laugh again, what would be fun about life? Image life if it were like detention all the time, never being able to just let loose, relax and have a good time. No one would want that. People would go insane, laughter calms people down and mellows them out. It helps create people's personalities and can affect others as well. Laughter is like a ripple in the water, it starts as just one single person, then expands out touching anyone near it. Laughing is contagious, like a @CAPS in mid @DATE, and brings joy to you and the people you can touch.  Laughter, it's the foundation of happiness.",25,21,0.0,46,0.0,0.0,0.0,46.0
12899,21531,8,"   @LOCATION has always been my place of choice to travel to whenever my parents question me of where I would like to go during the @DATE. The rolling green hills, stunning sunsets, and thrilling thunderstorms are certainly a large part for my reason to go, but the idea of seeing my @CAPS's side of the family again overpowers all of my other reasons. The core of my @LOCATION family has always been my @CAPS @CAPS; with her friendly smile, caring personality, and a sharp sense of humor, she makes friends and acquaintances wherever she goes. Yet, due to the fact that we live hundreds of miles apart, I'm only able to see @CAPS @CAPS three times each year: my family drives up to her house twice every @DATE, and she drives down to my grandparent's house for a few weeks in the @DATE. I cherish every moment I spend with her, especially when she accidentally makes a fool of herself and causes hysterics.   A few summers ago, @CAPS @CAPS, my @CAPS, and I traveled up to @LOCATION to check out some of the town's antique and flower shops before dinner. We had spent a few hours driving around town, scoping out all of these shops to raid them of any gems that either @CAPS or @CAPS @CAPS must have for their already old-fashioned homes. I had lost interest after the first few hours; antique shopping was never a passion of mine, and I was ready to take the one hour trip back to @LOCATION to go swimming with my cousins.     Once @CAPS and @CAPS @CAPS had spent most of their money on a couple of ""treasures"" a few hours later, we were exhausted and prepared to head home when we happened upon a pizza shop down the main street. Our mouths watered at the thought of eating a slice, but rather than going inside to eat, we ordered a pizza to take home and bake instead. In her white @ORGANIZATION pick-up, my @CAPS pulled into the shop's parking lot, leaving @CAPS and I inside while she grabbed the pizza. Upon her return a few minutes later, the aroma of the pizza wafted through the cab, making our mouths water and our desire to get home to grow exponentially. @CAPS @CAPS placed the pizza in the back seat, grabbed her coffee, and revved up the engine. We were all lost in our own thoughts about sneaking a slice of pizza when suddenly the front tires of the pick up dipped down and thumped onto the road. @CAPS @CAPS nearly dropped her hot coffee all over her lap, while @CAPS panicked and grabbed the handle on the door in reflex. We were all flabbergasted, stunned as little kids trying to grasp that the @ORGANIZATION didn't exist. Moments after the initial panic, we realized that @CAPS @CAPS had accidentally driven over the curb. We burst into laughter while poor @CAPS @CAPS had a red-rose face and an apologetic smile wider than the @ORGANIZATION. She cautiously drove with the traffic, laughing hysterically with tears in her sea blue eyes along with @CAPS and I.   Our hysteria episode lasted for a few minutes, in which time @CAPS @CAPS had pulled into a vacant parking lot; none of us wanted another unplanned adventure on the road. I wiped the tears from my eyes, trying to stifle the laughter and recompose myself. @CAPS was still giggling and wiping the mascara off her face. @CAPS @CAPS was doing the same, and then turned around to look at me. She locked her bright eyes with mine and smiled as sweetly as only she could, and we burst into more hysterics.   After @CAPS next small hysterical episode was over, we were finally able to pull back onto the street with the rest of civilization. As @CAPS @CAPS pulled out cautiously, I burst out, ""@CAPS not to run over anymore curbs!"" @CAPS drew up another round of laughter.  @CAPS @CAPS has always been there for me, through the laughter and the tears. Because we are family, we have a natural bond between each other. Yet without laughter, @CAPS bond would not be nearly as close and glued together as it currently is. Hundreds of miles of farmland and open road separates us. The occasional phone calls and e-mails are all we have to communicate between each other. My @CAPS is the most caring, humorous, and loving person I have ever encountered, and I unfortunately don't get to spend as much time with her as I would like. But every time I see her, I smile and think of the comical stories we have between each other. Without the humor and laughter we share, our bond would not be as close as it is, and we would both be clueless to our current world of joy.",23,27,50.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0
12900,21532,8," ""@CAPS days are diamonds and @CAPS days are stone,"" are the famous, melodic words of @LOCATION. He was absolutely right and the day of @DATE, was a very stony day. It began when I woke up late, having stayed up until eleven o'clock the night before in order to finish my homework. As I hurriedly pulled a sweater over my head, I ran downstairs and out the door, to school. Running under the dreary gray clouds, I suddenly remembered the geometry test that was scheduled for today. By my seventh period geometry class, the sleep deprivation was kicking in and my head was pounding. Of course, this had to be the day that @PERSON decided to cheat off my test. As his eyes swept over my paper for the third time, I sighed and stared pointedly at his own paper. I should have simply shifted in my seat so he could not see my test, but I wanted him to get the point. @PERSON, however, seemed to think I was cheating off of @PERSON. I took the reprimands silently and went to my locker. After collecting my belongings, I turned to go home. A loud ripping noise caught my attention and I realized, with a groan, that I had just torn my sweater on the corner of my locker. Without acknowledging the stares of my peers, I turned and ran out into the pouring rain. Once I had reached my quiet road, I could not contain myself. With my face turned towards the stony sky, I shouted until I my throat felt like sandpaper. I had never had any sort of emotional breakdown before and the feeling was strange and alien to me. I hoped that no one would ever see me like that, as I had transformed into a stranger, hurt and lost. Following my explosion, I trudged slowly home and entered the house to find my @NUM-year-old sister, @PERSON, begging me for macaroni and cheese. I sighed and put a pot of water on the stove. Maybe it was cruel fate or possibly just stupidity, but either way I ended up with half a pot of steaming water spilled down the front of my body. Granted, it was not very hot, as I had just put it on the stove, but all I could do was sit down on the cold kitchen floor, put my head in my hands, and cry. My sobs sounded like a frog croaking. I looked up suddenly, however, when I felt a small hand tapping my shoulder. ""@CAPS?"" @PERSON asked tentavely. ""@CAPS did the dog say to the cat?"" I just stared at her with leaking eyes. ""@CAPS are a cat-astrophe,"" she answered herself. A small smile was set on her pink lips as she started giggling. Then I started giggling, too, which led to uncontrollable laughter. It was a ridiculously humorless joke, but the laughter felt like cold water running over the painful burns the day had forced upon me. There we sat, a giggling little girl and a messy, laughing teenager, sitting on their kitchen floor on a very grey day. One little joke, with just one fit of laughter, had transformed my entirely stoney day into a perfect little diamond.",25,25,0.0,50,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0
12901,21533,8," My dad and i went out to teach me how to drive after recently getting my permit. I was nervous in the beginning ofcourse, but quickly became comfortable behind the wheel. I drove all over town completeing some errands we had to do along the way. Now it was time to go through the car wash, my first time in a carwash with me in control. I didnt think a car wash would be difficult to achieve after driving all around town, but i was wrong. After having a hard time pulling up to the right spot so the wash could start i had to roll up all the windows and fold the side view mirrors. Before i could do all that the wash had started! As a hurricane of soap swirled around the car i rushed to fold the side view mirror and was succesful. Unfortunately due to my slow reaction times i could not also roll up my driver window as the soap came back around and enveloped me in white foam. My dad and i were all wet and the inside of the car got all cleaned even though that wasnt the plan at first. I finally rolled up my window looked at my dad. He looked back at me not saying anything, the car was silent. After our minds finally developed wat happened we broke out in laughter. We had not stoppped laughing through the whole car wash and after because of the rarity of that situation. All i could say after that was that people go there whole lives without having that type of car wash incident, so why did it have to happen to me!",17,18,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12902,21535,8," You know when you're talking to a friend and they tell a hilarious story about that one time @DATE when they spilt soda all over the person next to them at the neighborhood barbecue, or they tripped in front of an entire classroom full of people on the first day of school? And then you think its so funny that you laugh so hard you cry? I remember days like those, you always tend to feel better when you laugh. When friends hang out laughter is usually involved. To be able to joke around with someone and be able to laugh you usually need to be comfortable to be able to find something funny. Laughter brings people together even on the worst days.  Everyone has those awkward times when you're talking to someone who you aren't having the best of relationship with but yet you have to make due and try to make it less awkward. There's also the random joke when someones upset to try to lighten the mood. When you get someone to laugh its so much less awkward because then you know they are in a somewhat of a good mood and its easier to talk with less tension. I've had plenty of days when I've gotten into a fight with a friend and I've had to talk to them for class or they insisted on talking. It's just like they just keep talking or just listening to you and you don't know what they are thinking or if they are judging you as you speak. But you know they aren't when you can get them to laugh because then they aren't really thinking badly of you. It also helps the tension. There's also the time when one of your friends is crying over something which makes you want to cheer them up or let them talk to you. Sure there's still tension cause of the fact that they are crying but joking about it or trying to get them to smile or laugh does help distract them and get them in a better mood. It's said that ""Laughter is the shortest distant between two people."" and I think that's true because when you joke with someone you learn more about them and they are more comfortable to open up with you. Also if you can have a good laugh with someone they are more likely to become a friend of yours since you know how to make them laugh and it's fun to talk to you. The more you and a friend can joke and laugh together the more close you usually tend to get with them cause you enjoy spending time with them and you're more comfortable with them and you know them better. And also when you can joke freely with someone you can usually also talk freely to them about anything and you know they'll be there for you when you need a good joke or someone to talk to. I know that I personally love to hear funny stories, I never really have many of my own that I remember. I love hearing jokes and laughing with my friends. It always brightens your day to have a good laugh with someone you know. But most people tend to giggle or smile when uncomfortable too. You know those times when someones having an awkward conversation with you and they ask a question you don't want to answer or don't know how to answer and all you cam do is giggle and smile when they look at you expecting to answer. Or when you have to talk to someone you don't know and you just laugh and keep messing up your sentences cause you don't want to mess up. I don't know if laughing when you're uncomfortable is just a way to make it less awkward or because you're too confused on what else to do. Sometimes when you get awkward and laugh it can make it even more awkward when they just find it weird and sometimes it helps when they then joke with you or just keep the conversation going and make it less awkward.  Even when you know someone you can still have those awkward conversations or those moments of laughing so hard you cry. It is also said that's ""Laughter is the greatest medicine."" I also agree with that because when you laugh you always tend to be in a greater mood and when you're in a better mood you tend to feel better in any way and you also tend to be more positive about things. Laughter brings people together in awkward, sad, good, or just normal conversations. The better you can relate to someone, the more you guys can joke together, the more comfortable you are with that person. Your day is always brightened when you share a good laugh with a friend, a classmate, a parent, anyone, even a stranger. It always helps lighten your mood even on the most stressful depressing days.",20,15,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12903,21536,8," Have you ever had a memorable time, where you laughed so hard with friends or family? Well I know I have had several of those times with my friends and family. I love those times that you laugh so hard your stomach starts aching really bad.  First, one of my most recent memorable laughing moments I spent with my mom that I don't see often. So this moment meant a lot to me as you can imagine. The last time she came to see my older brother and I we went bowling. She brought her friend down with her as well. My brother and I hadn't bowled in a very long time, but we knew we would still beat them. It turns out my mom beat me though. We had a lot of great laughs over that, actually I think that was the first time I wasn't a sore loser. Although, I'm still not sure how she beat me, she would through the ball down the lane sideways and some how it would go right down the middle. When you have moments like these, that you can look back on to help you through the hard times, it's really inspirational. All in all we had some really great laughs that day that were shared with my mom.  Another memorable laughing moment was spent with my dad and brother. Every once in awhile my dad, brother and I sit in our living room and talk about several different things, some good and some bad. They can be about my mom, school, our animals or all three of our compassion for sports. These talks always mean a lot to me because we never spend much time together. We don't get to spend much time together because my brother and me are always at school or in some kind of sport and my dad is always at work. These conversations have several effects on me sometimes they are sad and other times they make me feel better about things. There are so many laughable moments just in our living room. One thing we always like to laugh about is the way my dad always says album. For some reason he thinks he has to add another @CAPS in front of the @CAPS so it spells alblum. My brother and I enjoy making fun of him for that but we all have our moments we like to laugh at each other for. That was just one of the many things we love to laugh about.  Sometimes laughter is a very important part in someones life. For someone who is on the edge, or upset, just saying something little to make them smile or laugh makes all the difference in the world. Laughter is a great way to make people feel loved and excepted, also a great way to put people back on track when they're down. I know smiles and laughing makes me feel so much better inside. I hope you have had some great laughing moments spent with the people you love and care about.",15,20,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12904,21537,8," In the @DATE of @NUM' I spent two weeks at my aunt's house. At the time my cousins were living with her. My cousins and I are very close so we liked to spend time together. On evening we decided to watch a movie. I remember it was called my bestfriend's girl. So we started to watch the movie and it was super funny, we laughed constantly through out it. My cousin named @PERSON has an awesome laugh, everytime he started to laugh I couldn't help but laugh too. We watched the movie and afterwards we went to go get some food. We were all in a very good mood, making jokes and doing crazy things to make each other laugh or be funny. My cousins would change their voices, making then higher or lower repeating lines from the movie or just making things up. That night we ate @ORGANIZATION. When we got back to my aunt's house none of us were tired so we decided to watch a late night program called @CAPS @CAPS. It was a program composed of a bunch of short cartoons. They were all very funny. We would make fun of them and laugh and mimic what the characters did.  We stopped watching it at about @NUM in the @TIME, I was very tired but my cousins were not. For awhile we just sat on the couches and talked, continuing to make jokes and say stupid things that would make us laugh. About a hour later we all fell asleep and continued to watch movies and just hang out for the two weeks while I was staying there. It was probably the best time of that @DATE. I was very happy and enjoyed my @DATE because of my two cousins and the time we spend together. I laughed so much that my stomach would hurt all the time, but I didn't care because I was happy. I still spend time with my cousins and laugh a lot. I believe that our time spent together and shared laughter has brought us closer and more involed in each others lives. A person who can laugh, knows how to have a good time, and is fun to be around.",16,17,0.0,33,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.0

Breathing seemed virtually unachievable, as if I was choking on air. Everything around me blurred, spinning viciously as I clung to the fresh cut grass. Tears diluted the burn in my eyes, but not the sting in my nose, though neither caused my body to tremble as @CAPS did. Attempted screams came out as muffled moans. Alone @CAPS helpless, I could feel her staring at me, unsure of what to @CAPS. My best friend stood @CAPS watched as I grew more violent, pounding the dew soaked lawn with my fists, whimpers transforming into shrieks. A door slammed behind me @CAPS I felt the arms of my father, trying to guide me towards the house. Once inside, my dad buried my face in his chest in more of an attempt to silence my obnoxious wailing rather than comfort me. He apologized repeatedly, I imagine he didn't know what else to @CAPS. @CAPS was too early for the In a better place"" speech, but too late for everything to be okay. I continued to cry as stumbled up the stairs to my bedroom, @PERSON trailing close behind. Sitting on my bed @CAPS seemed like nothing was worse in the world. Suddenly, I was over-whelmed by the feeling I was missing something, like he was closer than I knew. I sat up to see his plastic sunglasses sat staring at me from my dresser. A black frame with neon blue sides. He @CAPS his ""stunna-shades"" danced through my head. Him standing out the car sunroof flexing shirtless, to propping himself up pretending to be awake in class. Seeing the glasses was like looking into his eyes. In my mind, his face held grief @CAPS frustration, he didn't want me crying. The few times tears fell down my face he'd say, ""@CAPS on, suck @CAPS up @CAPS take @CAPS like a man!"" I knew in my heart he wanted me to be with the people he loved @CAPS he wanted us to be smiling. With the morning sun beating on my back, I pedaled my bike as fast as my legs would allow. Reaching her front porch, I realized immediately the time I was about to spend in that house, would be like none before. When I let myself in as I always did @CAPS peered around the corner, eyes swollen @CAPS discolored. I took four steps forward @CAPS met her with a tearful embrace, in which I apprehended @CAPS wished I was him. @CAPS loved him in a way I'd never fathomed, but the desperate longing to be held by a loved one, I knew all too well. We cried @CAPS held each other because there was nothing more we could @CAPS. When there was a pause in the sobs @CAPS @PERSON actually looked at me for the first time, noticing I looked just as terrible as @CAPS did. I reached into my pocket @CAPS pulled out his sunglasses. @CAPS was hard not be selfish at a time where all I wanted was to be comforted, but I knew what I had to @CAPS. Forcing a smile seemed infeasible, but I knew @CAPS was my next step. Her gaze drifted down to the palms of my hands. ""@CAPS @CAPS."" @CAPS started weeping once more, I held her @CAPS tried to be strong. More of my friends crept out of the kitchen, tear stained @CAPS reddened as well. I smiled at them gently. They all took notice to the sunglasses in my hand, but didn't understand, they hadn't know him the way @CAPS @CAPS I did. We spent the day gathered around with a loss of words @CAPS hunger, our pizza sat untouched, the television on just to break the silence. No one said much, about anything. ""@CAPS you remember the time he hid our biology project in the freezer?"" I felt the question @CAPS up like vomit, too large to swallow. They just looked at me, not sure what to think. I feared I spoke too soon, I began to assume all of the melancholy @CAPS crying was supposed to continue uninterrupted for longer than @CAPS had. @PERSON smiled @CAPS nodded to my relief. ""@CAPS you got mad because he kept putting the nuts in your noodles."" I laughed aloud, I couldn't help @CAPS. I was flooded by the memory of him trying to act confused as to why the boiling water had cashews floating on top. ""@CAPS you remember how he'd always braid your hair?"" @PERSON smiled even greater.  The rest of that month was filled to the brim with tears, but @CAPS overflowed with laughter. When @PERSON died, laughing was the last thing I wanted to @CAPS. @PERSON always generated the larger portion of my laughter, @CAPS with him gone I never imagined I would @CAPS again.

12906,21540,8," Laughter in my life is one of the most important things, because it is often the motivation I need. Whether it be an embarrassing situation that I laugh at looking back on, or when I'm feeling angry and my best friend does something to make me crack up. Sometimes I just feel sad, and if I'm around the right people, the ones who bring the laughter out in me, I know it won't last long. I know that to get my mind off of something, all I need are a few giggle here and there.  Recently, I started going to the gym. I have always been overweight and out of shape, so the gym, like many other attempts, seemed like it wouldn't last long. When taking the tour of my gym originally with my mom, who suggested we try it out, I was pretty excited. Of course this was because it was something new, and I was pumped up enough that I wanted to start that day. My mom, being the more logical one, and of course, the one who would be paying monthly for the membership, wanted to think and talk it over a bit more. In the end, my mom decided that it was right for us. At first my mom kept me motivated. Because I was so out of shape, I got tired after five minutes on the elliptical, at the easiest setting. Seeing my mom beside me on the treadmill, working at it and not even slowing, kept me motivated. Just looking at her made me so happy that every now and then I'd just let out a short burst of laughter, followed by a questioning look from her, but then she would also laugh. Sometimes I thought it was just because I was tired and somewhat delirious from the exertion, but looking back on it now I know I was just happy that my mom and I finally had something to do together. The happy gym days were short-lived, because as usual, my mom was too tired and whatnot to go anymore. I promised myself to go once I was able to drive myself regularly. A few weeks after my birthday, I got my license, but another thing got in the way; my car was a @NUM-speed, and I only knew @CAPS to drive automatic. So after begging my mom almost every day to take me to practice on my new car, she finally took me. In the dark church parking lot, the same one I started driving automatic in, more laughter between us started. She would have me close my eyes and ""feel"" where the clutch and accelerator @CAPS about halfway. At first I thought this was so absurd that I would just start cracking up, and my mom would join in with her laugh. Once I finally got the hang of taking off, which to me is the hardest part, but, like always, laughter was there to make things easier. I learned to drive stick quickly, and because I had made that promise to myself, my first trip for myself was to the gym. My motivation that time was being able to finally do something progressive just for me, and the satisfaction was doing it by myself. The whole way to the gym, I sang @PERSON in the twangiest voice I could muster, which led to more laughter. The first few times of going to the gym were based solely on the knowledge that I was doing something good for myself. After about the fourth time, though, my motivation started to dwindle. Instead of listening to my iPod while on the elliptical, I started to watch ""@CAPS I @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS,"" because it would get laughs out of me while I was still working my butt off. Before I knew it, the episode was over and I had been going strong for almost an hour, burning @NUM calories. I was so impressed with what I had accomplished that it felt like the motivation was fully replenished. I started going daily again. In a week and a half, I had lost @NUM pounds just by going to the gym, working out, and most of all, laughing. Part of it was self-motivation, but another part was the laughter that so easily distracted me from the task at hand. Because I had been getting into shape, I was also able to increase the ""@CAPS"" level on the machine, and am still going every day. Each day it feels easier and easier, and now I have ""@CAPS"" and ""@CAPS @CAPS"" to make me laugh even more while working out. I believe that in many cases, laughter has saved me. Whether I be sad, mad, down, or in this case, not motivated enough, it was always an option. Knowing I have those laughs to look forward to at the end of the day makes me keep getting in my car to drive to the gym. I'm still losing weight, and this is the first time in my life I've felt truly energized. Laughter was a huge part.",20,25,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0

Here is an example in which laughter brought my boyfriend and I together. I had been crushing on the same guy, @PERSON, for two months. I was way too nervous to speak to him. One day my friends and I were walking down the hall where he happened to be. When i saw him I tried to turn around and walk the other way, but my friends pulled me back. They then told me they heard from a ""little bird"" he liked me too, so we continued to walk in his direction. We stopped walking right in front of him and my friends pushed me into him then ran off. I told him sorry as I turned bright red. My best friends had set me up. We stood there for five minutes in an awkward silence. All I did was stare into his beautiful blue eyes. All i could think about was how hot he looked in his black wrestling shirt and his faded blue jeans. He probably thought i was a freak. He had been leaning against the wall standing mostly on his right leg. Then when he went to switch to his left leg he let out the biggest fart i have ever heard. We started laughing. After we had settled down from laughing hysterically, we started talking. We ended up talking for two hours. A couple weeks had gone by and we had been talking more and more each day. Another week had flew by and we went to our first movie. I called @CAPS our first date. That night he asked me to be his girlfriend. I of course said yes. Ever since the day he farted I have thanked @CAPS for @CAPS. I wouldn't have him as my boyfriend if @CAPS weren't for him braking the ice with his embarrassing moment. Most of all I thank my friends for shoving me into him that day. There could not have been a better way to meet a guy. This is just one example of laughter and how much @CAPS @CAPS change or affect a situation. Laughter is the medicines of all medicines. @CAPS is one of the most important tools a person @CAPS have.",20,18,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12908,21542,8," Laughter is what I'd like to call a ""@CAPS @CAPS of @CAPS"". Because no matter what language or tongue you speak, when something funny occurs, the natural reaction is to laugh. This reaction is present for all people, and when it takes place; it's contagious and helps to bring everyone together. Laughter also emits a sense of happiness and joy, which in return makes people feel more free and open to join in and laugh as well. In many instances, if there is an awkward situation at hand, laughter plays a big role in lightening the mood; and making the atmosphere a little more comfortable. In @DATE laughter was a big key in the success of our annual @ORGANIZATION.  Our @ORGANIZATION consists of around @NUM people (including cousins, and some close friends); so as you can see it @MONTH not be easy to get to know and interact with everyone. However, at dinner time we like to switch it up, and sit next to relatives that you wouldn't normally sit next to. At first, it's usually very awkward, and sometimes even frightening for the younger kids, when they end up to sitting next to our very loud and opinionated aunts and uncles. That is until my @LOCATION decides to crack one of his hilarious jokes.  My @LOCATION is somewhat of a @CAPS of awkwardness. Not necessarily that he enjoys being in awkward situations, but rather that he enjoys watching them play out. Eventually about halfway through the meal, after eating in close to utter silence; he decides to stand up and give a little toast to the @ORGANIZATION. Following the speech, he always concludes with a well rehearsed joke; which, gets everyone laughing. Some of the younger cousins don't always understand the play on words. But what really gets them going, is listening to all of our aunts and uncles hoot and holler things like ""@CAPS @CAPS"" and ""@CAPS help me"" mixed in with their obnoxious laughs. After all the fun dies down, the awkwardness always seems to drift away, leaving us with the feelings of happiness and joy that I described earlier. I believe that those feelings directly correlate to lightening the mood, and in helping to get everyone more comfortable with who they happen to be sitting by. Once all these things occur, conversation gets flowing and everyone ends up getting to know a @ORGANIZATION member, that they otherwise might have not gotten the chance to truly meet. Laughter is one of the keys to happiness in life; because without it, life would be very dull and boring. Laughter also has the power to change situations, and to make them better for the most part.  In @DATE, laughter changed a situation in my life for the better, just like it has done so many times since then. In my eyes, laughter is the best @CAPS of @CAPS out there. If you really want to get to know a person, all you have to do is make them laugh!",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12909,21544,8," I choose to have a positive out look on life and I'm generally a happy person. Who wants to go through life mad all the time? Even at my lowest I know that I have a lot to be thankful for. Because of this, laughter is an every day factor of my life. When I'm with friends and family I am always laughing. Laughter is my medicine and I wouldn't be the same girl with out it. When I was in the fourth grade my family and I began going to a new @CAPS I didn't know any one there and I was really nervous about going to @DATE @TIME. Mom walked me down the stairs to the classroom and the teacher introduced herself to me. Her name was @PERSON. She was pretty and very tall with a funny australian accent. She was wearing alligator skin boots with black jeans and a pink top. Ms. @PERSON introduced me to the class stating my name and grade. after taking my seat we recited @CAPS versus and read short clips of @CAPS stories. When @CAPS had ended mom came downstairs to gt me. Reculctant as I was to see her I took hold of her hand, said bye to @PERSON,and went back upstairs without one word from any of the other kids, but on our way upstairs a girl about my age, from which i recognized from the class said goodbye to me. I returned her nice gesture with a smile and a wave. One week later mom took me downstairs to @ORGANIZATION. This time I was relentless and determined to make a new friend. I went and sat down next to the girl who said goodbye to me last week. I introduced myself to her and she told me her name was @PERSON. We soon became very close. Every week I was so excited for @CAPS so I could spend time with @ORGANIZATION. We became best friends! We played on the same soccer team together and we pretty much live at one anothers houses. In fact @PERSON has her own toothbrush at my house and I have one at her house as well. One time @PERSON and I were in @CAPS, and now that we are older we go to the main service, we laughed so hard we almost peed our pants! @PERSON and I have so many great memories together and though we are becoming older the memories will last forever.",15,16,0.0,31,0.0,0.0,0.0,31.0
12910,21545,8,"          Making jokes or just talking about funny stuff and laughing with people can make conversations comfortable and lets people see your true self . In my opinion.                         Laughing is one of the most important things you should have in a relationship with someone because you need to keep having fun and laughing about funny things. Laughing also make you feel close too people because once you and that person get to know each other you'll just laugh about anything even if its not that funny.For example when i first meet people i am very shy, I don't really say much but if the person that i am talking to makes me laugh, it makes me feel comfortable and makes me want to joke around with them, it makes the conversation fun.  If there is no laughter in a relationship the relationship is practically dead. No one wants to be around a person with no sense of humor. In my opinion everyone has a funny side, some people like to show it and some people like to keep it to themselves. Some people might be funnier but the things is we can all be funny in our own way.  I've had many experiences where laughing has benefited my relationship with people. Me and my friend met in middle school ,I was good friends with his sister but i never really got to know him until I went to high school. I had a lot of classes with him so i started talking to him, but because i already knew him I wasn't very shy. The first day that I talked to him at school he was making fun of me but not an a mean he was joking around how I brought chocolates to his house and I didn't offer him any , it was more of like an inside joke. The thing is our relationship started off with us laughing and joking around. So I immediately felt like i could be my self around my new friend and not worry about what he would think. Now we are best of friends,we laugh about everything and we have are own little inside jokes.When I am talking to my friend I can say anything that I think is funny and I know he will laugh at it. Laughter has really made my friendship with my friend fun. One of the best relationships I have with a person is with my sister and its because we just laugh all the time when we are together . When either of us is going through a ruff time we still find a way to make each other laugh and forget about all our problems for a while. Even though we are sisters and we naturally have a bond, laughter just makes are sisterly bond ten times better. We have very similar personalities, and we are both pretty funny so the laughing never stops between us there is always something we laugh about.  Laughing in my opinion is very important to have in a relationship, without laughter it would be a miserable, unhappy relationship. Laughing brings out the good side of people in most cases, it brings out truth in people. when you first meet people, laughing really makes conversation comfortable and not awkward. Starting a relationship with laughter can really make you good friends for example like my friendship with my friend. When you are sad or mad,it really makes you feel better when you have someone that makes you laugh it just makes everything better it really can change some peoples mood and make them forget about the negative stuff in their life for a while. Laughter is just a great way to bond with people. Having someone to laugh with is just very important to have in life.",20,18,36.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0

I got out of bed that morning, throw on a pair of old torn up blue jeans and when downstairs to get some breakfast. On my way I could smell the sweet aroma of eggs and hash browns that made my mouth water. My brother was up and about and had just finished his plate. My mom handed me my plate and and I reached for the bottle of @CAPS.Ethan was sitting across from me as i ate and said""We'll leave in an hour or so"".I said okay and went on eating.After breakfast we gathered our poles and tackle boxes and put them in the car along with an old boat we kind of jacked of the old neighbor lady. We put our stuff in the van and mom drove us into town. It was about eight in the morning so we wouldn't get back home till about three or four in the afternoon depending on how the fishing is. There was a little store in town and the creek went right behind it. It was a small creek. I grew up on it so I thought i knew what to expect. We put in behind the store and our mom left after telling us to be safe. It was a chilly @DATE morning and a little cloudy. The water was cold and my brother said I should wear his waiters. I thought it was silly seeing as we would be in a boat. Burt I put them on and we put the boat in the water. This was the first time we ever even used the boat so it was exciting.   As we went down stream the water got fast and loud and the embankment was like a wall to the outside world. As we took the next corner there it was. A water fall about as tall as a man. Not the kind you would see in the movies but it was good enough for our eyes. Right in the middle of it was a big rock and water went around both sides of it. We where pushed right up agenced the rock and where all most thrown from the boat and we grabbed the rock for dear life.We where stuck and I looked at my brother and he kneaded as if to say down is the only way.So with that being said we both let go and let the water have us. As soon as we let go it was like being om the back of a two thousand pound animal in a rodeo the only lasts a second. When the boat sunk my waiters filled up instantly and and it took all i had just to hold on to that boat that was pulling us down stream now. We lost all of our gear except the tackle boxes, an oar and that stupid boat. It took all we had but we finally got the boat out of the water and poured the water out of it and the water out of me. I was scared for my life now. This was suppose to be a fun fishing trip but it was now a game of survival. We couldn't turn back now. the only way to got home was to go the rest of the way. I was cold and wet and didn't have any options. We had to continue so we tried it again just to sink. We spent most of that day carrieing the boat around rapids and throw brush all day until it mellowed down and we could put the boat back in. We got to a big pool, so big you could fit a house in it. There where some small rapids running right throw the middle of it. It dint look bad but with what we had bean in we dissuaded to be extra car full. We went around the rapids through the pool. As we went we burly braised the end of the rapids with the boat and we went in. I tried to keep from sinking but my waiters where to heavy. As i tried to swim to shore my shoe fell off and went down stream. Being stupid a chased after it on my belly to get it. The water was faster then I thought as I let it @CAPS me. I was swallowing so much water and i couldn't breath. I could feel it begin to get deeper and soon I couldn't touch bottom at all. My shoe was right in front of me and I finally got to it with burly anything left. I got to shore and just law there choking up water. After ten minuets I got up and went back. I think it was freak luck we survived that day but some how we did. I learn a lot that day and laugh about it now.",17,18,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12912,21547,8,"  It is true that laughter is important in any relationship, friendship, and in life sometime laughter gets you out of trouble sometimes get you in to trouble. but the more we laugh the more we are going to be happy. I time that laughing came in handy was in @CAPS school.  In the @NUM grade @CAPS person was split into a group. The popular girls, band nerds, hippies, and the jocks. The lunch room was always how you knew who was who. The popular girls would sit with the jocks everyone of the girls had a boy to flirt with, the band nerds on the floor making straw recorders and drums out of milk cartons, the hippies all in a circle eating salad out of one tray. None of these groups ever intercepted each other.  I fell into the group of the hippies. we wore green everyday and peace signs on as many clothing we were able to get on our tiny little bodies. We were the nicest group, We helped with @CAPS @CAPS friendly activity there was to do. We did recycling everyday. My @CAPS school experiences was outstanding. The best thing about our group was that we knew how to laugh, we would giggle chuckle, or laugh so hard that our mouths were open and we were holding our gut but no sound would come out.  On a beautiful @DATE @TIME we decided to sneak out of the lunch room, why did we? I don't know. We all just really wanted to sit outside and eat. The golden rule at lunch time was: @CAPS person had to raise their hand to be excused and then take a green card to be able to @CAPS outside. After you got a green card you had to take it to the outside teacher which showed her/him that you could be outside. But instead of waiting to get excused, we walked all the way around the other side of the building to sneak around to the bright green lawn that was filled with flowers. I don't know how we managed to sneak around with no teacher seeing us, but we did. When we saw that bright green lawn we ran to it like a four year old running to a ice cream truck. We all skipped, danced and ate our lunches that our mom's packed us. we all sat in a circle and passed around food. the day couldn't get any better. In a matter of fact it got worse. when we were done eating we went and played on the play ground forgetting that we weren't aloud outside in the first place. We swung on the swings, climbed on the monkey bars. we were screaming, laughing talking. Which led to a teacher coming over and told all of us to come to her. Her voice was calm like she was trying to keep a bear down her throat so it wouldn't come out and eat us. We sat there with big bug eyes and all held hands. The teacher said we were in really big trouble, and there would be really bad consequences. And we all knew that before she told us. A few seconds after she told us that, I just started laughing really hard. I couldn't stop, it was like someone put a spell on me to never stop laughing. Everyone looked at me like seriously you pick right now to bust out laughing. I was on the ground curled up in a ball with my hands holding my stomach and my face was bright red. I couldn't stop laughing. Finally i got a hold of myself i looked up at everyone around me looking down at me. I looked at the teacher and she started busting out laughing. We all sat there in silence staring at her. Now she was the one on the ground, I couldn't even believe it. she looked at all of us, and said ""@CAPS have fun, it is a beautiful day out and you girls are nice ones, i will let it @CAPS this time, but just don't do it again"". We all hugged her and ran off to the swings and monkey bars. To this day i will never forget that moment. Just a simple laugh got us out of being in so much trouble. who would of thought. it is true that, laughter is important in any relationship, friendship, and in life. having laughter in life makes the world @CAPS round.

12913,21548,8," Laughter, one of the wonderful things that we humans can enjoy. Laughter with friends, family, and with people we do not even know. We all can enjoy and share laughter, it is one of the amazing things that can bring us together no matter what ethnicity, age, gender, or disability. We all can enjoy it together, and no one can take it away from us. Laughter is simple, but yet complex in many ways. It is like falling into a pool of @CAPS. Laughter, just the word ""laughter"" brings me joy! When our days go sour laughter is there to sweeten it up. Where would we be without the wonders of laughter? Laughter, it is like a tool. It is the thing that has helped me make new friends. Also, laughter has helped me get out of conflicts from both friends and enemies. It has also aided me into achieving the things I want. Laughter is @CAPS my middle school years. My family and I moved a lot, and every time I moved I had to make new friends. It got very difficult for me to make new friends every time I transferred to a new school. After I have settled down and got used to the surroundings of the new school I then started to make friends. I noticed that laughter was a key element on making people like you, and then later consider you to be what is known as a friend. After I have made new friends, and became very comfortable with my school the time to move came again. It gets difficult to make new friends, but its even harder when you have to leave the new friends you just made behind. After moving so much I just got used to making new friends, and later on laughter slowly became more like a tool than something that I should enjoy. A tool for just making friends. After I got into high school I just stopped trying to make new friends, because I felt that I knew I was going to make new friends, and then transfer to another school, and then start all over and make new friends again. I gave up trying and decided to get more involved in school and achieve good grades. Later in the year I felt like a kid with no friends, because I stopped trying. I decided to go and make new friends, but somehow it became a lot harder to make friends in high school than middle school. I tried to be the funny guy like I was in middle school, but I just didn't have it in me anymore. Also, when people get older the type of humor people enjoy changes. As time went by I realized that you don't have to make everyone laugh, so they can be your friend. It was about getting to now the person, and to be able to relate and to be a there when they needed you the most. Making friends at a new school is not easy, but it also is not very hard. All you got to do is be open to people and let them know who you are. This is what I learned about making friends. You can't make everyone laugh, because everyone has a different taste in humor. Humor and laughter are different from each other. Everyone has a different taste in humor, but we can all come together and have a good laugh. Laughter is wonderful. It is what puts people in a good mood. We as people @MONTH have our differences, but we can still all laugh together. It feels very good when you get a good laugh, but its even better when you know that the person who made you laugh did it so you can be happy. We should not take laughter for granted for it is something that puts a smile on our faces.  ",15,20,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12914,21549,8," In the story i am going to tell you, it involves one of my friends and myself. After school one day meself and a buddy of mine went to my house for the night. It was alot of fun, we started off playing video games and laugh really hard when one of us would die in the game. Then after awhile of that it was dinner time and my mom told us to get off and come eat. it was really fun at dinner, we throw stuff at each other when my parents weren't looking. It was a blasted, until dinner was over and we didn't have anything to throw at each other anymore. But now it was time to start playing games again. Now at this time it was about teen o'clock and we were getting really tried so we put in the movie step brother and watched it. It was the best time we had all day we were laughing non stop at everything that was said in the movie and it was great. We both loved it and really wanted to watch it the next morning. But before we could my friends dad was there to pick him up so that was the end of the best time with my friend and the funnyest time ever too. It was great we laught non stop the whole night.

12915,21550,8,"Have @CAPS ever had that one friend who was your best friend, that @CAPS could go to for anything, that @CAPS were so close to that @CAPS guys knew everything about each other, from the way their nose flared when they laughed to their deepest darkest secret. Well @PERSON was that type of best friend to me. Us two crazy monkeys became friends in first grade. We were never the type of girls to sit down in class and read a book or stay calm all throughout school, no, we were the girls playing sports with the boys, getting dirty and scratched up. We always were laughing and playing and having a great time. Laughter was a big part of our friendship because,well, we were always laughing. We would get in trouble for keeping our parents up late at @TIME with our crazy jokes, loud laughing, and hyper psychotic ninja adventures we would take during the middle of the @TIME. No matter what we were doing, we could always make a joke out of it all. "" @CAPS guys are perfect together"" said my mom one day, and all I had to say in reply to that was "" I know, we are two monkey ninjas.""  @PERSON and I had this one restaurant that we loved to go to, it was @PERSON @PERSON. @CAPS, @PERSON s @CAPS would take us to there at least twice a month and we would always get the same exact thing every single time. @PERSON and I could make some things funny that no one else understood. We would sit there in the booth with @CAPS and talk about the funny times, the stupid fights, and end up laughing uncontrollably throughout the time we were at @ORGANIZATION. It was a warm @DATE @TIME, @PERSON had come over to my house and was planning on spending the @TIME. We had our whole @TIME planned out, we were going to call her @CAPS and talk him into taking us to @PERSON, and when we got back home we were going to go on a jog, then get ready to go on an ""adventure"" is what we liked to call them. So we called @CAPS and had creatively talked him into taking us. But the catch was, was that we had to go over to @LOCATION s house mow the yard, plant some plants, weed some of the garden and then he would take us. So we went of course and did all the work that we agreed on doing, and we went to @ORGANIZATION, dirty, sweaty, and exhausted. By this time everyone at @ORGANIZATION knew our names by heart. We made jokes with them and sometimes even got to go in the back room and get our ranch if there wasn't too many people there. We ate our food, got extra fries, extra ranch, and were sitting there with full bellies. We were all ready to leave, but @CAPS had to go to the bathroom. So @PERSON and I sat there and waited while he was in the restroom. He was taking a longer amount of time than he usually does, which was fine with us because we wanted to talk about this one boy that @PERSON was having a ""thing"" with, which we couldn't talk about while her @CAPS was around. Finally he comes out of the bathroom, and i notice his zipper is down but he is so close I didn't want to say anything to @PERSON about it until we were further away from him, and him being in his playful hyper mood wouldn't let us get far enough away from him so I could tell her. As we were walking out of the door, I finally told @PERSON to tell her @CAPS that his zipper was down. So as she turns and looks she bursts out into laughter because while his zipper is down he is talking to a group of people that work there. So as we are both laughing hysterically we are trying to tell him. We finally got him to start walking out of the door, and at that time @PERSON says between giggles "" @CAPS your zipper is down,"" he looks down and does his nervous/oh my goodness laugh and zips it up.  The whole ride home, @PERSON and I are busting a nut laughing as hard as we could. Our stomachs were about to explode because of laughing so hard. @CAPS was in the front seat occasionally giggling because he couldn't believe that his zipper was down the whole time. And as we were nearing my house he says "" there was a song playing, and I wanted to hurry and write the lyrics before they were over, I really liked that song ."" That to me, was the funniest thing @CAPS ever said. @CAPS went home and bought the song on i @CAPS, and also learned to check his zipper more often. @PERSON is the perfect best friend for me, we are just a like in many ways. But our sense of humor is the most alike.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

I road around the block a couple of times, when I hit a curb and crashed. My handle bar hit me in the lower rib cage. My mom took my to the doctors office to see if I broke a rib. The doctor said I had only bruised it.  On the way home I was in so much pain, my mom made a stop for some ice cream, that didn't help. When we got home I just lade on the couch for a while. I heard knocking, it was @CAPS. The first thing he did was asked what happened, I said I didn't wont to talk about it rite now. We ate diner then played a game. Then we watched some movies eventually we both fell asleep.  We woke to the smell of bacon. I was still a little asleep, by the time I realized that I had woke up @CAPS was down stars. I was in so much pain I couldn't get up. So I just lade there for a short while. @CAPS came back up the stares to see why I didn't get up. He seen me just laying there. We just started to laugh, I noticed that i felt a little better but I didn't think much of it. After we ate we turned on the @NUM, my mom said for every one to clean but @CAPS and I could play, cause I was hurt and @CAPS was a guest. We play mortal combat @NUM, @CAPS and @PERSON, and @CAPS and @ORGANIZATION. I won most of the time, tell he started to cheat, but it was still pretty fun.  When we were done we watched a funny movie, we laugh so much, that when it was I almost for got about my rib cage. We went to the park to shoot some hoops. As soon as he shot it then it bounced off the rim and hit him in the face, I thought that was funny, he didn't seem to think so. When we got bored we headed down to the market to get a snack. When we were eating I told him what happened with my bike, he ask if it made a visible mark, we look and seen it look just liked a smile face, it was funny but creepy. When we got home, he said that he wanted to ride bikes. At first I was a little scared, but nothing big. We rode around my yard for while. His mom got their shortly after.

12920,21556,8," The new trimester had started and leadership was my second period. With no idea of what the responsibilities of a leadership student were, I was skeptical on taking the class. After days of taking the class, I began to enjoy it more and more. After a week or so, the teacher announced we would be on stage helping set up and organize the upcoming assembly. I had never done anything of the sort so I was somewhat excited. Days went by and the entire class practiced setting up the assembly, running to our places, moving props, and stacking chairs. The day of the assembly finally arrived, it was time for the show. The students poured into their seats as we scurried around behind the curtains. Everything was set up perfectly. The curtains rose and the assembly began. My peers and I stood behind the stage watching the assembly unfold. The school band preformed a long boring set of songs, the curtains fell and the entire leadership class ran out on stage, picked up and stacked the chairs that the band just used. After, we all ran to get the bleachers and dragged them out to the front of the stage. The choir was now going to preform, we then retreated back behind the curtains.  The choir sang their songs, and we watched, but as they proceeded to set up for their last song, students moved around leaving a large open spot in the top row. With the choirs last song, they preformed a simple swaying dance to go along with their song. My leadership class friends and I, noticed this large open spot in the choir and thought it would be hilarious if one of us went up there and pretended to sing and dance. However, none of us had enough courage to do it. The choir finished their song and dance, the first assembly was over. We then cleaned up and got ready for the second assembly. It was time for the second assembly and everything was going to be preformed again. The students came in, sat in their seats, the band played, we stacked chairs and moved bleachers. It was time for the choir to come out and sing once more. The thought of how funny it would be to go up on the bleachers and dance came upon us once again. Finally we convinced one of our classmates to do it. She ran to the choir room and put on a choir robe, put her hair in a funny bun fixed on her forehead, and stepped up onto the bleachers.  She took the open spot in the top row. The song began as well as the dance. She broke into random dancing, not in any way matching up with the other dancing choir members. It was obvious she did not belong up there. The crowd soon began to realize what was going on. Laughter broke out in the seats, but soon after laughter broke out behind the stage as well. I was laughing like I had never laughed before. It was painful, tears pouring down my face, I was gasping for air. Running out of breath and bracing myself for a deep inhale, when right at that moment the song had a dead silent pause. The auditorium went completely silent, I inhaled in, and as I took in that air, my body managed to let out an extremely loud embarrassing screeching noise. People behind the curtain stared at me, I knew that it was heard throughout the auditorium. Embarrassed I laughed even harder, causing more pain, tears, and lack of oxygen.  The song ended followed by the end of the laughter, then by the end of the assembly. The girl stepped down from the bleachers and we all scrambled out of the building, hiding the robe along the way. We laughed all the way to our next period, listening to the students in the hallway talking about it. Giggles filled the school for hours. Talk of who it was, what actually happened, and why it happened were on everyone's minds, except for ours. The second period leadership students knew exactly what had happened. We had the pleasure of telling everyone in school about the dirty little details. The following days however, the teachers also got word of it. Not thinking our actions all the way through, we would soon have to face the consequences. We were told it was irresponsible and child-like. We had a plethora of possible punishments, in school suspension, @DATE school, a referral, an apology to the choir class, and loss of the privilege of being in leadership. After the school board talked to our parents and gave the event serious consideration, we got out of it with having one day of @DATE school and apologizing to the entire choir class. The school board, realized it was just a joke, letting us off easier than it could have been. In my eyes the prank was well worth it. For weeks on end, every night I would go to bed laughing about that leadership assembly.",23,21,0.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.0,44.0
12921,21557,8," Have you ever laughed so hard that you cry? Your chest is bubbling with the laughter, and tears spilling out of your eyes; faces turn bright red and your body is practically having convulsions. This is not the forced kind of laughter, this is uncontrollable. This is pure joy. I laugh like this at least twice a day, tears and all. If it is even possible for your laugh reflexes to be connected to tear ducts, I swear I would have it. If I have a good laugh during the day, then I wont be so sad later to come. It has made me a much happier person. And it has even been able to bring me together with other people.  @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION was not a time when laughter was abundant in my life. This was a time in my life where I worried and would dwell on the past. I was a deep fourth grader. But my friends were much different. @CAPS did have their bad moods on occasion, and whenever we were feeling down we would sit on the @CAPS @CAPS. Very creative, I know. This @CAPS was navy blue, and sat right at the corner of the playground right where the baseball field started. We would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives.  One day as we were dismissed to recess, four of my close friends and I went over to the @CAPS. We watched as the boys ran as fast as @CAPS could to the field to get their daily game of football started. Almost every guy in the @ORGANIZATION would go to the baseball field and play touch football. It was the cool thing for the @ORGANIZATION studs. And sometimes the girls joined in too. While we were sitting there sulking on the @CAPS, a few boys walked up to us.  ""@CAPS to play some football with us? We could use more people!"" @CAPS said. We weren't in the mood for playing football, but with the persistent nagging, we had to give in. The square field was soggy from the @ORGANIZATION rain, and the grass turned into muddy mush wherever you stepped. Us girls would avoid any contact and we ran much slower then the boys. But we managed to score a few points for our team, and duck for cover when needed. The football lightened our moods, and was much better at making us happy then the @CAPS @CAPS. So a new tradition was formed. Every day we would go out with the boys and not have a care in the world as we chased each other around. We dove into the mushy mess of a field to save a ball, and lunged to tag any person we could get to. The @CAPS was out of all of our minds as we ran around having fun.  But one day while we were playing it was extra muddy from a storm the night before. It was hard to navigate as you were running around on the slick field. People were slipping and falling constantly. And then something amazing happened, it started raining all over again. But nobody had even thought of quitting. We just laughed and kept going. The rain blinded us, and the slick ground was no help. So a collision was inevitable. One of the girls picked up the football. The ball had been through a lot, and now it was covered in mud. She had a clear shot of the end zone, and sprinted the best she could given the circumstance. When out of nowhere a boy from the other team popped up in front of her. But instead of swerving to miss hitting him, she slid. It was a priceless moment, almost taken from a cartoon. Her legs slid out from under her and she landed square on her butt. Everyone on the field was already peeling over, clutching their stomachs from the laughter. But she continued to slide. The boy in front of her was too busy laughing to notice she was headed in his direction. That is when she took him out too. But he was unfortunate enough to land on his face. His body sprawled on top of hers with his head directly in the brown wet ground. Even the two that fell couldn't help but laughing. The game was halted as we all shared this priceless moment. We were brought together by a simple game of football, and uncontrollable laughter.",18,25,42.0,42,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.0
12922,21558,8," Many believe that laughter is the key to the start of a great friendship. @CAPS can mend the broken bridges between people and even make awesome relationships even better. Laughter can be such a powerful thing and most don't understand @CAPS powerful. I especially didn't know until two years ago when I met @PERSON. @CAPS only took the move of my former @CAPS @CAPS to understand laughter's full potential of the beginning of a great friendship @CAPS all started a couple weeks before school ended when the news was received. At the time i was part of a small @CAPS group, in a small church, in a small town. @CAPS @CAPS, @PERSON and @PERSON were moving, and would no longer be able to lead the @CAPS group. The entire church congregation was saddened by the sudden news. But none were as depressed as the @CAPS that they had touched in their many years in ministry. We had grown used to the couple. Many of the few that had been around the longest , including myself, had spent nights at their house, or in my case babysat their young daughter. They were like family to all of us and no one wanted to see them go. But sometimes I wonder if they hadn't what would have happened. Many well wishes and tears were exchanged between the day they had departed. As a congregation everyone thought that no one could ever touch our hearts they way that they had. But that was just a thought. Two short months later, word had gotten around that someone from @LOCATION was traveling here to our small town in @LOCATION for an interview for the newly open position. All the teenagers were guarded the moment that he had walked through the door. His name was @PERSON, only in his early twenties, but had quite a lot of experience in ministry. My first thought was that this must be some kind of joke! @CAPS could he lead a group of kids if he's only a kid himself!? I wasn't very keen of him. Neither was anybody else. But something was very different about him. He wasn't afraid to tell us about his life, @CAPS he had grown up, and seemed to be totally honest with everyone of our questions we asked. And that was when we knew as a @CAPS group that maybe he was the one.  Even though I knew @PERSON would be our new @CAPS @CAPS I still didn't want to accept @CAPS. I tried and tried to avoid him although @CAPS always seemed we were having to deal with each other more than either of us wanted to. So finally, @PERSON decided @CAPS was time that the two of us needed to get to know each other. One @DATE @TIME my mom got a call from someone at the church, she wouldn't tell me who, but that I needed to go. So I did. And who was there? @PERSON, in the sanctuary just the two of us and the associate @CAPS, because @CAPS would be too inappropriate for us to be by ourselves. "" your mom didn't tell you @CAPS your here, did she?""I laughed, "" @CAPS no she didn't"" "" @CAPS do you feel you and I talk? Go hang out, wherever you want?""""um....ok @CAPS do you feel about going to @ORGANIZATION?"" The question was puzzling to him, @CAPS did to most, but he accepted the idea. ""@CAPS @CAPS are we going to @ORGANIZATION?"" he said as he pulled into the parking lot."" I don't know @CAPS was just the first thing that popped into my head.""We both chuckled. I felt more at ease with him now and actually thought for the first time that maybe this would be a pretty fun trip.  As we walked through the building @CAPS started to be quite boring. But the boredom faded away as we decided to pass through the toy aisle, and set off all of the toy alarms and sirens. Toy after toy had started to go off as we went through the aisle touching every toy that made some kind of absurd noise that would drive anyone up the wall, which many did. Finally we walked around the store to other departments in the store and got to know each other a little better. @CAPS surprised me that both of us liked a lot of the same things. He told me more of his childhood like @CAPS he was adopted and what @CAPS was like before hand and afterwards. @CAPS was wierd that only a short time ago I didn't want anything to do with @PERSON and now I was walking around @ORGANIZATION laughing and just having a good time. That was about three years or so ago. Shortly after @PERSON had to leave. Many rumors were told @CAPS because he didn't really tell anyone other than the fact that the council had asked him to leave. No matter the reason I still am in touch with him and am glad that the day at @ORGANIZATION had happended.",18,20,0.0,38,0.0,0.0,0.0,38.0
12923,21559,8," Though my sister and I have very different personalities, and much of the time do not find humor in the same things we have still shared some humorous moments. It's the times you decide to just go with the flow and enjoy someones company instead of letting it bug you.  One sunny day in @LOCATION I had some how convinced my sister to go rollerblading with me. My dad drove us to a park that had a huge pond in the middle of it. The pond was nice in the fact that there was a smooth side walk that circulated all the way around the pond for my sister and I to @CAPS on. The pond was not so nice in the fact that it was very littered with ducks ans geese and of course their droppings as well. We always thought of the ponds water as one of the most disgusting things on earth. We got our roller-blades on and carefully stood up. Our dad was going to take a nap in the car wile we made our laps around the lake. As we skated we noticed a man and a woman sharing a date together in a very small boat. They were totally unaware that their boat was tipping strongly to one side. My sister and I thought it would be hilarious if all of a sudden the boat tipped over.We let that thought pass and continued in our rout. On our next lap around we heard a woman yelling. we looked up and saw that it was the woman who had been in the boat. The woman was now standing on the shore yelling at the man to get all her belongings that had fallen out of the boat and were now floating in the gross pond water. The man was waiting in the water up to his chest collecting their items and trying to deal with his upside down boat. ""That date was defiantly unsuccessful"", I thought. We could hardly contain our selves from bursting out with laughter. We roller bladed back to the car as fast as we could. My sister was in front of me and when she tried to stop she couldn't. She basically body slammed the car, fell back, and rolled right underneath it. My dad rapidly opened the door to find me crying with laughter. We pulled my sister out from under the car and drove home.      ",15,16,0.0,31,0.0,0.0,0.0,31.0
12924,21560,8," When I told my mom that I wanted to @CAPS from sunset to sunrise to raise money for a trip to @LOCATION, she laughed. Her laugh was one of utter sarcasm, as if she was saying, ""Is this a joke?"". Yet, when the crazy idea of running for @NUM hours straight was truly thought through, the laughter began to melt away. The idea made sense; I wanted to go to @LOCATION with my school's band with a cost of roughly @MONEY. My family didn't have that money, and I certainly wasn't going to bribe my neighbors penny by penny to buy cheap cookie dough from a magazine. I needed to earn my money, in a way that not only was meaningful, but also efficient. What better way to do that then to do a long distance @CAPS; a skill that I not only loved, but was also good at? The plan started small; I would @CAPS from sunset to sunrise with some friends, wanting to raise about @MONEY. After consulting my distance coach, I realized that running for @NUM hours would entitle me to over @NUM consecutive miles.So what if I was fifteen years old and had never even ran a marathon before? Something in me told me it was possible. And so we laid out the plan; I was to @CAPS about @NUM miles a week, with three hour runs on @DATE. I ran about ten miles a day, including hill repeats, running backwards, and many, many lunges. For some reason, both my coach and I agreed that I could do it.  Running was one thing, but then there was the reason behind the running; raising money. A family friend, @PERSON, who was both a runner and an organization whiz, helped me out. When I informed him that my goal was to raise @MONEY, he looked at me and firmly said that I could do better. We started out with local businesses, asking for things ranging from bananas to an energy gel called ""@CAPS"". @PERSON taught me how to dress, talk, and present to each business, helping me create a flier to put up in coffee houses, and a way to organize the money I brought in. Next, came the friends. Surprisingly, I found that a lot of my friends not only wanted to donate, but also wanted to participate in the all-@CAPS @CAPS, and thus was created the running ""shifts"". Soon, I had about twenty people who were going to @CAPS with me, ten businesses who sponsoring me, and four ""drivers"" who drove cars with mattresses, food, and water in the back to support me and my ""crew"". Before I knew it, my whole community was cheering me and that crazy, laughable idea on. The @CAPS of the ""@CAPS @CAPS All-@CAPS @CAPS"" came before I knew it. The day before my stomach was twisted in knots, and it almost impossible to rest. Yet, as people arrived ready to @CAPS, drive, and cheer the whole event on, my fears began to subside. The weather was wonderful, with clear skies and decently warm temperatures for early @DATE, and everybody who came were cheerful and encouraging. As the sun set on that fateful day of @DATE, a group of roughly twenty teenagers all with a crazy goal and strong spirits, set off from my home in an awkward jog, knowing that they would return when the sun rose the next day having conquered something almost impossible. As we ran, headlamps were turned on, music was cranked up, quirky runner games played to pass the time, and silly songs were sung to keep our feet moving in the briskly cool @CAPS. The hardest part for me was returning to my home after @NUM miles for a bathroom break around @TIME and realizing that I still had seven hours left. As the miles and minutes began to blend together in the seemingly endless @CAPS, it became hard for me to believe that the sun would ever rise again. We all wanted so badly just to stop, rest, and sleep. That @CAPS, with our feet pounding the cold pavement, we ran like shadows through the endless @CAPS, our eyes searching for the sunrise that would signify our time to stop.  The sunrise that rose the morning of @DATE at @NUM am was the most welcoming sight I had ever seen. @NUM miles behind me, and well over @NUM for each person in my group, we were all exhausted and cold to the bone. Everyone who had been resting jumped out of the support cars and joined me for the last mile, every one of us watching with awe as light seeped into the darkness, stunning the quiet, frost-covered world on with warm light. The sun rose big and orange, and when my feet finally stopped, an exhausted yet exuberant shout left the throats of everyone. It was then, in that gorgeous sunrise, that me and mom hugged and laughed; a laugh that was not sarcastic, but spoke of how a girl who had done the impossible.",28,22,44.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.0,44.0
12925,21561,8," My best friend is probably my brother, @PERSON. It was in the middle of @DATE and we were sitting outside on top of the wooden table in our mother's backyard. @PERSON started telling me how much he wanted to be done with high school and that he was, ""just done with all this."" I sat there listening attentively for maybe thirty minutes as @PERSON poured his heart out, and nearly broke mine with how distressed he was. @PERSON's best friend, @PERSON, had just told @PERSON that @CAPS he went out with the girl @PERSON liked, then their friendship was over. @PERSON was extremely hurt by this betrayal added on top of how he was afraid of getting kicked out of school because of his grades, and the amount of pressure coming from our parents at the time, was simply too much for seventeen year old @PERSON to handle. I talked to @PERSON for at least another half hour after that about what I thought he should do, at the end of our heart to heart talk I told @PERSON that, ""@CAPS you don't get it together and start geting good grades, their going to kick you out of school, @PERSON. Honestly, @CAPS that happens I'm going to be really mad at you; becaus the only person @CAPS and @CAPS are going to have to nag on is me."" We both laughed quietly for a minute, paused, and laughed until we cried.  I don't know to this day what was so funny, maybe how serious everything was when we were just kids or @CAPS it was simply a release of stress and anxiety for both of us. My tiny, little, lame joke that I dropped at the end of our talk just made it all seem okay, made us think about how young we are, how minor so many of these problems were in the grand scheme of life. That inital laughter made is possible for us to simply let go. After this happened @PERSON and I went on with our lives as @CAPS this had never happened, never speaking of it. Except that @PERSON never got a bad grade in the rest of his high school career, he chose his friend over a chance at the girl but found another girl who has @ORGANIZATION's approval. Was it laughter that helped @PERSON get through this difficult time? I couldn't say, but what I do know is that there was laughter there and @PERSON did what he needed to do.",18,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12926,21563,8," The sound of laughter could be one that breaks all barriers. Just a single giggle or quiet chuckle can expand someone's world. Laughter is a sign. It's something that tells someone new ideas, desires, or dreams are going to be created. Once one laughs, he or she getting along with someone -- they're forming a relationship. The first time @PERSON and I laughed together, there was no doubt in my mind it was the start of something new. Once I heard his cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS-so-very-cute giggle, I was set and ready to be swept off my feet.  I was privileged to hear that laugh for three days of my summer in the year @DATE. It was a @DATE, and for the past four days I was bounding and skipping throughout mountains and hills in the never ending desert of @LOCATION, @LOCATION. That day, my cousin @CAPS and I were about to wander in to a familiar territory of ours: the mall. As a bonus, that cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS-so-very-cute giggle was bounding and skipping along with us. When @PERSON walked over to us in the food court, he definitely succeeded in playing it cool. You could tell he actually made time to comb his hair and decide what he was going to wear just to look as spiffy as he was. ""@CAPS, hey guys!"" he called out smoothly. Our eyes met immediately, and already my cheeks hurt. The next few minutes that we spent together were crucial. I needed to make a good impression on this guy. We stood in the line of @ORGANIZATION, where he would retrieve his usual order of two @CAPS @CAPS' @CAPS without lettuce, a large order of fries, and a large @CAPS. Pepper. As for me, all I wanted was a small vanilla ice cream cone. Glancing over at the other register, I saw @PERSON turn his head my way in the corner of my eye. ""@CAPS, do you have @MONEY?"" he hesitantly asked me. He fiddled with his pockets a little, while also brushing his luscious blond locks from his face. I chuckled silently to myself, and his reaction was one that is to this day one of my favorite things about him -- his smile. Still chuckling, I said ""@CAPS,"" and carefully handed him the @MONEY. To this day, @PERSON is my very best friend. Eventually, I did get back the @MONEY he owed me. Ever since that one moment when we were standing in the waiting line at @ORGANIZATION, the next several hours were jam-packed with laughter. I don't really remember a single thing he said that didn't at the very least make me grin as hard as I could. Literally, with several leaps and flips, on that day I made a new friend. And even then, I was completely unaware of the amazing journey there was to come with this boy. It was all because of that very first natural instinct @PERSON and I both had towards each other; to laugh. If I had never laughed so hard my stomach was aching, or never laughed so hard tears were running down my cheeks, there is just no way we would have had the connection that we did. His unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS-so-very-cute giggle never gets old. Laughter is one of the main keys in our friendship. One of us has to let out a little cackle every once in a while. Also, @PERSON is still in @LOCATION. I'm not. As badly as we both wish we could be, we're not in the same place. We need to be able to thrive and grow in separate places. So, with that, if someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" then they were absolutely correct. When @PERSON and I laugh together, it doesn't feel like we're fifteen hundred miles apart. So this laughter, this just @CAPS-so-very-cute giggle, is an element and part of my life that I am indescribably grateful for. This laughter formed one of the greatest relationships in my short fifteen years of life, and I sincerely hope it will form many more wonderful memories in the years to come.",21,25,0.0,46,0.0,0.0,0.0,46.0
12927,21564,8," The surrounding area is dimly lit, accompanied by a fluorescent lamp shaded in the corner. Our blaring television screening an action packed, science fiction movie drowns out profane rap music escaping from my brothers headphones. Cuddled up on the couch my sister, @PERSON, and I alternate braiding each others hair. Our small kittens @ORGANIZATION and @PERSON race to their food and water. As always @PERSON is superior and @ORGANIZATION scurries up the dining room chairs, defeated. Irritated @CAPS @CAPS sighs heavily with frustration once @ORGANIZATION trips his laptop charger and rips it out of the socket. Keys jingle, the door slams, speedy footsteps: @CAPS's home!   By now it is @NUM o'clock and we have settled on the couch and everybody seat checks after snatching some food. The aroma of spicy @CAPS food steams the entire apartment as everybody feasts on chalupas and gulps down @ORGANIZATION from @LOCATION. Napkins are distributed and the cats linger around our feet, waiting for their share. The last bite of my chalupa is portioned between the cats, which causes a bit of ruckus. @PERSON undertakes @ORGANIZATION! The thief in @PERSON's attitude begin to shine through as she robs @ORGANIZATION's portion. This causes @ORGANIZATION to hiss at her, and proceed to hop onto the coffee table. On the way, she charges through the five drinks at the end of the table, managing to knock over two of them. Then the nacho cheese, being very unnoticeable, coats her striped gray paw leaving one-inch, yellow-orange circles to puzzle us. Minute but sharp white teeth are exposed and she devours the remains of @PERSON's chalupa. Raining down the coffee table are trails of blue fizzy @ORGANIZATION, and puddles gather at my feet the new suede couch. Smothered by booming laughter, @PERSON screams at @ORGANIZATION for stealing her chalupa. Following the escape of @ORGANIZATION, @PERSON trots innocently behind her. My sister is still steaming angrily so in attempt to calm her down, I take off my newly @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION-stained sock and catapult the mess toward her head. Instead of the sock slapping her in the face like I had hoped, it whistled past her ear and splashed in the fullness of my mothers stomach. Between the sock and the cats, the whole family is cracking up! @CAPS @CAPS reenacts the situation and his wild sound effects encourage our laughter even more. After a few minutes, the chuckles die down and we prepare ourselves for the next humorous incident.  I am freezing and muddy after a rainy softball practice, my siblings are just lounging around, @CAPS @CAPS is frustrated from failure of employment, and @CAPS is weary and exhausted from a long day at work. We all look forward to what the night has in store for us: laying our busy brains on a fluffy pillow and allowing slumber to take over our life for the next @NUM hours. Looking past our sleepiness, we can still happily spend time with one another. Considering the fact that @PERSON is younger than @ORGANIZATION, hilarious situations such as this, amuse my family daily. Surprisingly @ORGANIZATION wore the warrior suit this time which added a few extra minutes to the process of the hilarity. Not only that, by also the fact that it took a toll on everybody's dinner. My family is blessed with the knowledge of seeing light in odd situations. The main element in our memorable moments is laughter. Laughter is one of the few bonds our family will hold forever.

Not too long ago I also discovered that laughter can relieve you from stress, and it even helps you lose weight, which, I thought was pretty interesting. My sister on the other hand still did not quite believe that laughter could do all of that. She thought it was just being blown out of proportion. She believed that if her friends didn't want to hang around with her, then there was something wrong with them, that if we didn't have enough food in the house, it was probably my parents fault. There was always some one to blame for whatever happened to her, there was always a bad side to everything. But that @DATE it was going to be different she was about to find out that she didn't have to live her live that way, because there is always an alternative.     The trip to @LOCATION was something everyone was expecting, even me. I was actually really excited to see my cousins and the rest of the family. Everybody packed their things, we got ready to leave, got on the car and left to the air port. My aunt @CAPS was already waiting for us at the @LOCATION city airport. Everything was going great. So far... When we got there, my aunt drove all of us to our little town in the state of @LOCATION, just about an hour and a half away from the airport. As we were getting there I noticed my sister had a strange look on her face, she seemed somehow confused, lost in her own thoughts as if she was worried about something.""@CAPS's wrong with you, are you okay? you look all weird..."" I said sounding a little sarcastic and hoping to start a conversation.""@CAPS face is all weird!""she said and that was the @DATE thing she said to me until we reached our destination.  As we got to our grandparents house we begun to see all our family members already waiting for us outside. The joy of seeing them there was incredible. I looked around around and i saw my sister, I was glad that she looked happy, i thought she was actually enjoying the moment. I did not know @CAPS was wrong with her and her sudden attitude changes until we got to the little playground my grandma has in the backyard. During my time there I met new family members, saw some old familiar faces and remembered some good and also bad memories, memories which I thought had vanished from my mind already. Turns out they were still there, all the way at the back of my head were I had tried to hide them so that they would never come up again, but somehow they managed to get out and make their way into my thoughts again, and that is when I started to feel like a monster once again. Suddenly I had a flash back to the time when we came to visit, a couple of years ago. That's when it all came to me i saw the whole scene once again I felt horrible. There she was, my little sister @PERSON playing in the swings, suddenly she let go of the swing and she felt right into a mud puddle that was there. Every body laughed, I laughed. I thought it was funny, but she didn't laugh, she didn't cry either, she just got up and ran inside.  I never stopped to ask her if she was okay, I didn't realize how my actions had affected her. It was all my fault, I knew she was really sensitive when it came down to some specific situations, but I did not help her, I didn't give her the comfort and support she needed from her big sister, so she never learned to laugh at herself and keep going. That would have been a nice advice to give her instead of laughing at her. Then, after a couple of minutes of reflection about it, I went up to her and apologized, she looked a little confused at first, but then she realized where i was going. This made the rest of the trip a lot more easier, now that I knew @CAPS was wrong, we both tried our best to fix the problem and work on her self esteem.  Laughter was the perfect therapy for her. All she needed to do was to learn how to laugh about her self when things did not go the way she wanted them. It was hard but we accomplished our goal. My sister discovered the power of laughter, and she learned to get back up from her mistakes. Life taught both of us an important lesson that @DATE. I'm sure that was one of the most exciting trips we've ever taken and the memories from that trip will stay with us forever.",19,18,0.0,37,0.0,0.0,0.0,37.0
12929,21567,8,"Laughter I've always been one who laughs a lot. It does not take much effort for me to bust out in a laughing fit, the topic doesn't even need to be that funny. I'm not the type to do the ""nervous laugh"" though. I think my laugh fits me well because I am quiet, just like my laugh. I always get a little embarrassed when my laugh gets louder than usual.  The weather lately has been very cold with snow falling here and there. I have just been itching for some good, warm swimming weather. This past weekend my boyfriend, @PERSON, and I went up to the mountains to play in the deep snow. After a few hours of being up in the snow we headed back down the mountain to go to his house and use his hot tub.Obviously it was very cold and me, being more of a fair weather girl, just wanted to go somewhere to warm up. First we stopped by my house so i could grab my swim suite that I recently ordered off line and was dying to use it.  We left our clothes in the back room and ran out in the cold to get in the hot tub on his back patio. The hot water felt so good; it relaxed my body of ice and my tense muscles. We were in the hot tub for about forty five minutes before we noticed how hungry we were. Since we had gotten all warmed up we decided @CAPS sounded good. We jumped out of the hot tub and ran for the back room to dry off and get our clothes on. I had gotten all dried off and started to put my jeans back on. When I put my first leg in my jeans I just had a feeling that I was going to fall. Sure enough, when I got my second leg half way in the other side I lost my balance, tripped over a huge exercise machine, and fell hard on my butt. I started busting out laughing, along with @PERSON, I was a bit embarrassed but at least it didn't hurt too bad. After I had gotten up and walked around for a few minutes my butt started to hurt more and more.  @PERSON kept making jokes about me falling, even though they were pretty funny, I tried not to laugh. He was facing me while we were having a conversation, when we were done talking he turned towards the door to leave and hit his head square on the exact same exercise machine I had tripped over just minutes before. Instantly, I was bent over laughing. I could not move, I was laughing to hard. It looked like it had to hurt when he hit his head, he had a nice red bump under his eye. He didn't find it nearly as funny as I did and just walked out the door. Still, laughing hysterically I tried to follow him out the door but it was hard to move from laughing so much. My stomach was hurting from all the laughing when it finally started to subside.  Still having a little giggle left in me, I walked to his pickup to wait for him while he was talking to his dad. When I turned around to see if he was coming I started laughing again just seeing him walking to the pick up. The look on his face when he seen me laughing again was just priceless. I could imagine why I looked ridiculous to him; sitting all by myself in his pickup laughing hysterically again.  Laughter is one of the very few things in this world that is free. Everybody's laugh is unique and can change due to the situation. There are many different laughs a person can have such as nervous, happy, giddy, and so on. If people can share a laugh it can bring them together. Through out the world laughter is a universal sign of happiness. People of any age, race, or religion can share a laugh. Over all, laughter is just a great feeling.",20,25,0.0,45,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0

When I noticed that I have woken up ten minutes late, and so I jumped out of the bed and sprinted to the shower. When I was finished, I got dressed in my @CAPS-shirt and jeans, which is what I normally wear, then unplugged my cell phone from the charger and placed it in my pocket. Having dealt with the situation at hand, I went down the stairs and into the kitchen to prepare the modest meal of oatmeal. After I was finished eating, I packed up my books and walked back up the stairs to brush my teeth. After doing so, I swiped my coat and hat in one fell swoop. I secured them to my person, grabbed my back-pack , and walked out the door. I stood there on that cold and rainy morning, pondering what the day would hold for me. Suddenly , their was a great noise, I turned to face the approaching threat only to find that the bus had arrived. My mind quickly recovered from @CAPS slightly startled state and I stepped onto the bus. The bus ride was no different from the others, kids squawking about what happened at school yesterday, what they are doing @CAPS @DATE, and other seemingly useless conversation. There I sat my eyes fixed gazing out the window of the bus, watching , studying , and mapping the present course of the massive vehicle. We stopped at one of the bus stops, and on the bus came my good friend @PERSON. As usual she came and sat down next to me and we started talking about the usual cars, music, and the occasional jokes. As I started to develop a creative and captivating joke, she just belted one out right off the top of her head. We both just started busting up laughing, I even felt a tear form in the pit of my eye. We didn'@CAPS stop laughing until we got to the school,and my joke was successfully forgotten.  The joke lingered in my head all day long, to @CAPS day I still think it is one of the best I've ever heard. Through all of the countless jokes, underhanded comments, and puns I've heard, that one brought about the most laughter of all. But then @PERSON moved away to another city, @CAPS was a sad day. The very next day I heard the age old saying, ""@CAPS one time at band camp....."", story and laughter was restored to my life.

12931,21569,8," It all started when my eighth grade class had a plan to go see a movie together. I had the idea to see a movie, so i picked a few movies that were in theaters. The choices were between, '@CAPS @CAPS,' @CAPS of the @CAPS,' and another movie that i cant remember. We, as a group, decided to go to @CAPS of the @CAPS. The movie stars @PERSON, and @CAPS from @CAPS @CAPS. I thought that the movie was really good but there was one part in the movie that made me laugh so so hard. The scene starts out with @PERSON and @CAPS wandering around trying to find a place to stay for the night; and they seemed to have @CAPS @LOCATION; @LOCATION plays an important part on the movie. After a long day full of scary situations, they find a good size cave that they decide is a good spot to stay for the night.   Back tracking a little bit, earlier that day, and in the movie, @PERSON came across a native fellow named @LOCATION. @LOCATION is a a man like creature that walked like a monkey but has the face of a human but has an all around harry body. They came across him while traveling through the desert and saved him from execution; for that, @LOCATION is very grateful and is @CAPS guide around the mysterious @CAPS that is foreign to man and that has never been seen by man.  Back to what i was talking abot earlier, when @PERSON and @CAPS end up in the cave the see two full body skeletons sitting at a table that has an old record player on it, but the record is playing and making music. Just a second later @LOCATION comes in the frame of the scene and does a little dance that puts him close to, but in front of the table. Then @LOCATION does multiple pelvis thrusts to different directions, basically humping the air.  Watching that scene made me laugh the hardest that i have ever laughed in my life. To this day i look back at it and laugh just as hard as i did the first time i saw the movie.  About a month later, I went over to one of my good friends houses and we watched the movie again. When we got to the scene of @CAPS jig, we both fell down, off of the couch laughing. We replayed that scene about ten more times and ended up crying because we were laughing so hard.  Laughter is good for the soul and moral, and for friendship building. Thank the @CAPS that he made us laugh!",18,16,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0

The concert was the best concert i have ever been to and probably the best one i will ever go to because @ORGANIZATION is my favorite band. They even played the song that made them, its called @CAPS @CAPS. When we were there the music was really loud and a bunch of people were drinking and getting drunk and doing stupid stuff. Like this one guy who was standing behind his girlfriend who was sitting down in the grass, this guy had a few too many to drink. He was standing behind his girlfriend laughing at a joke that oneof his drunk buddies told him and then he leans on his girlfriend but just falls on her and folds her right in half like a lawn chair. My @CAPS and @CAPS started laughing, it was pretty funny. But then the guys girlfriend got up and walked out of the stadium so he got pretty sad. The rest of the concert was pretty funny. The front rows seats were only for people over @NUM because during the concert the band would bring out some beer guns and shower the front rows with beer. The front rows were the craziest rows. The back rows were pretty crazy too, people were smoking marijuiana in the back rows, but we werent. When we left we all smelled like weed and didnt want to get pulled over for any reason and have the cop think that we were drugies. It was a long ride home, we live in @LOCATION, @ORGANIZATION and we drove to @LOCATION, @LOCATION and back in one day. I was so tired, we didnt even take any chairs to the concert so we had to stand up in the same spot for about @NUM hours. But it was all worth it to see my favorite band in concert. They had a few other bands before them that were also great. Bands like; @PERSON, @CAPS/@CAPS, and @CAPS. So it was deffinetly the best concert I have ever been to. The second best concert ive ever been to was a @CAPS concert in @LOCATION with my @CAPS @PERSON and @PERSON @PERSON during the @CAPS @CAPS. There were a lot of things we did before the concert like; look at animals, eat, go on rides, buy things, eat more, get drinks, and walk around the @CAPS. A lot of things made @CAPS laughlike when my @PERSON stepped in horse and goat poop and when my mom dropped her food on her lap. The concert was really cool, they played some songs to there new album @CAPS and @CAPS. It wasnt as long as the drive to the @ORGANIZATION concert and it wasnt as good.

12933,21571,8,"                                                The Laughter In @CAPS @CAPS are so many elements in a person's life that are important. Many are to make friends, be successful, but mostly to find happiness. Everyone wants happiness in their life right? The biggest form of happiness comes from your heart. Many believe that laughter comes from your heart and is believed to make you and others around you truly happy. One element to laughter being important in a relationship would be optimism to your partner and friends. This shows people that you aren't just a pessimistic, rude, unhappy person all the time. You can actually enjoy life and have a good time.After all no one wants to hang out with someone who is always negative and only looks at the bad things. Your partner will get sick of you and you will lose friends. Being able to laugh and joke around with people makes life a whole lot easier.It @MONTH not seem like much but it takes some stress off your shoulders if you have a good time and kick some giggle's. Another reason why laughter is so important in a relationship would be the sound of your laugh. What if you get a boyfriend our girlfriend and they had never heard your laugh before and once they heard your laugh they thought it was the most annoying thing in the world? Studies show they would be more than likely to leave you. On that note, if you do have a terribly annoying laugh and that is the reason you dont want to laugh, I would stick with smiling because us girls have pretty cute smiles that let us get away with alot. Lastly, @CAPS is one more main part of laughter being important in a relationship and that is happiness. You need to laugh to to be happy. Without laughter what is a smile? Without laughter how will happiness shine through? Lif e can get pretty boring when all you do is act like a mime. No smiling, no laughing, not fun! When you laugh, it helps others to laugh and have a good time. Plus, its fun! Like when you laugh so hard you cry or when you need to go to the bathroom really bad and it makes it worse when you start busting up laughing. Laughing makes memories. And memories are a very important part of growing up. So now that you have learned these three elements as to why or how laughing is important to anyones life, relationship or friendship, go out and laugh. It will make you feel a whole lot better. :)",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12934,21573,8," Hello my name is @CAPS @CAPS i am going to walk you through one of the most hilarious experiences i have ever had. It is a story about me @CAPS my friends @CAPS a little adventure we had @DATE, a day we would never forget. It starts off on one of the nicest days i had ever seen, i mean amazing, blue sky's, warm @DATE air, @CAPS the sound of the laughter coming from the children playing in the street. Me @CAPS my three friends @PERSON, @PERSON, @CAPS @CAPS were sitting on my back porch in a circle playing our guitars, as usual @CAPS we decided that we needed to go do something, something new. As we sat @CAPS thought about what we could do nothing came to mind. Until @PERSON suggested that we go to the beach @CAPS meet up with his cousin ""@CAPS has a nice house right on the beach @CAPS probably wouldn't care if we stopped by."" @CAPS said. The three of us looked at each other @CAPS looked an @PERSON @CAPS said ""lets go!"" We packed our boards, guitars, @CAPS food @CAPS we headed out. On the way we decided to go to the @CAPS city skate park, none of us had ever been @CAPS. We drove around for at least an hour looking for it. Aggravated @CAPS about to give up on finding the park we decided to take one @DATE loop @CAPS @CAPS what happened. ""@CAPS it is"" yelled @CAPS ""@CAPS's the park i found it."" We looked off in the distance @CAPS @CAPS it was. The cradle, the snake run, everything. we pulled in @CAPS parked. We got out of the car ready to skate, but then out of nowhere it started pouring @CAPS the park was soaked. we headed back to the car seeking shelter only to find that @PERSON had locked his keys in the car. Luckily @CAPS had @CAPS so @CAPS called them @CAPS had them come @CAPS unlock the car. it took them an hour @CAPS a half to find us @CAPS unlock the car. Now we were all mad @CAPS wondering if it was a good choice to go on this trip. @CAPS leaving the park we decided it would just be best if we went to @PERSON's cousins house @CAPS stayed @CAPS for the @TIME. When we got @CAPS we were greeted with open arms @CAPS warm clothes, ""looks like you guys have had a rough one"" @CAPS said, ""I'm @PERSON, I'm sure @PERSON has told you all about me by now."" @CAPS we changed in to the clothes @PERSON had given us we went @CAPS sat by his fireplace to warm up. The five of us sat @CAPS @CAPS talk for what felt like forever. Then I said ""i wish we could have a big fire on the beach."" ""we can"" @PERSON said, ""i know the perfect place."" @CAPS took us to a small bay on the beach about @NUM yards away from his house, @CAPS called it driftwood bay. ""@CAPS, told you i had the perfect spot."" @CAPS it was perfect, secluded, sandy, @CAPS all the firewood you could ever need. We built a fire @CAPS kept throwing wood on it until it was over @NUM feet tall. For the rest of the day @CAPS on through the @TIME we sat around the fire, playing our guitars in a circle, @CAPS telling the story of our day. Laughing @CAPS noticing that even tho the beginning of our day wasn't very fun we closed it the only way we could have wanted, sitting around a fire, music playing in the @TIME, @CAPS sharing a good laugh with your friends.",17,18,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0
12935,21574,8,"     Laughter means a lot in a relationship in @CAPS opinion. Laughter can mean a few things. It can mean that you are having fun and that you're enjoying life. All of @CAPS friendships and relationships contain laughter. Half of the time we laugh, the other half we express ourselves. Laughter could also mean the beginning or ending of a relationship. A lot of people would think that laughter is a joyful reaction, but sometimes a person could be laughing because they are nervous. But I think what we are talking about here is the joyful kind. All of @CAPS friendships contain laughter, but they also contain the moments when someone needs to be listened to or heard. One of @CAPS friendships that contains a lot of laughter is with @CAPS friend @PERSON. Ever since the day that I first met her, we've laughed a lot. Usually, its @PERSON being the joker and me being the audience along with a few other people. But, there are also moments that don't have laughing involved. Moments, when @PERSON can be a great listener.     Making jokes and giggling can show how close you are to someone. Like @CAPS friend @PERSON and I. She's one of @CAPS closest friends. We share everything with each other, well at least almost everything. We tell each other whats going on in our families and all that good stuff. But there are so many moments that are just filled with laughing, giggling and making up jokes about @CAPS knows what. Whether its twisted in some weird way or even when it doesn't make sense we still laugh about it. It doesn't matter how stupid I @MONTH act around her, we always laugh it off and make fun of each other. Not in a bad way.      Usually, when people fall down, they feel embarrassed or scared of what everyone else would say. There was a time that I was sitting on @CAPS friend, @PERSON's skateboard, just sitting and rolling up and down the sidewalk, when I came upon a bump. I'm pretty sure you could guess what happens next. I flew off the skateboard and landed on @CAPS butt on the cement. I sat there for a second and just stared. Shocked that I had flew off of a skateboard while just sitting down. Pretty disappointing. But the next thing I knew, I was laughing, like it didn't even matter that I had just landed on @CAPS butt, infront of one of @CAPS friends. @PERSON was laughing too. I didn't mind. @PERSON didn't even tease me about it. Laughing can shrug things off your shoulders helping you turn it into a joke. That's what I did.     @CAPS relationship with @CAPS @CAPS is full of jokes. @CAPS @CAPS is the type of guy @CAPS just loves to tell jokes and/or act like some historical figure to confuse people. When I answer the phone half of the time @CAPS @CAPS tries to see if I'll fall for one of his little tricks. One time, he tried saying that he was @PERSON and that he invented all these different electrical items. I shook @CAPS head was like, ""@CAPS, you're not very good at acting."" @CAPS he said, ""I'm not your @CAPS. this is seriously @PERSON."" I laughed and said ""@PERSON is dead. How could he be talking to me over the phone when he's dead, @CAPS? I know it's you."" @CAPS @CAPS laughed, ""@CAPS told you I was dead? Obviously, I'm still here, little lady."" I smiled, ""@CAPS huh. Sure. And I'm not a little lady."" ""@CAPS fine, I give up. You can't get a joke, can you?"" , he said. I frowned, ""Of course I can what are you talking about, @LOCATION? It's just you're not very good at acting."" ""@CAPS sure, blame it on me."" , he laughed, ""where's your mother?"" That's when the joke ended of course, but @CAPS @CAPS and I actually have a strong relationship. He's @CAPS adopted @CAPS, in case that hasn't been mentioned. So, when I first met him, we weren't as close as you could probably guess. But after a year, we got closer and I learned that I could trust him. And that half of what he says is basically a joke. Sometimes, I wonder if he ever knows how to be serious, so he doesn't confuse people, for example, me.     For me, relationships should always have laughter otherwise it just makes it all serious. Making it very hard to stay close, in @CAPS opinion. And me, myself, I like laughing and having close friends. Because when I'm feeling down, it's always nice to have someone there to make you smile and laugh. It's a great quality to be able to laugh and help people. Without laughter in the world, like I said before the world would be too serious, way too serious. @CAPS would want that? I wouldn't. That would be terrible.  When people laugh, it makes the world a better place to live in, in @CAPS opinion. Laughing is a gift, a very special gift.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12936,21575,8," To me laughter Is someone showing joy and excitement to the others around them. Laughter @MONTH some times be used In the wrong kind of way such as @CAPS someone where to get hurt In any kind of way the other person laughs at them when @CAPS hurt them. When I can make someone else laugh or giggle @CAPS not only makes me fill good but also the other person I was talking to. @CAPS shows both of us that we can be happy and that there Is joy @CAPS of us. I have a friend that I go to school with everyday and he always just looks so grumpy and or upset. And when someone asks him what Is wrong or @CAPS he Is okay @CAPS seems that he just gets more angry. So me being one of his closer friends I try and help him with that, and so far @CAPS has been working and I can make him happy by laughing and getting a big smile on his face. Every time I see him In the hall way or even out of school I will always say something to him to get him to smile and laugh. And by the way I show him I care and him knowing that I don't want him to be grumpy to others we have grew a bond and we seem to spend a lot more time together. And by him being In a better mood @CAPS makes his hole day of school lot funner and more enjoyable, and for all the others that are around him. @CAPS I were to explain who I was I would say that I am a very happy person and that I have respect for others and I express and show others that. Being happy brings joy to other people that are surrounding you witch usually leads to laughter. Laughter Is a very Important part of your daily life and I think that @CAPS brings people closer, so use @CAPS don't be afraid.",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12937,21577,8," Laughter is important in any relationship because it brings two people closer, connecting them between something they have in common forming an unbreakable bond between the two of them laughter is the glue that holds together any relationship and keeps a person from breaking into tears when something wrong happens. In fact without laughter I probably would not even get through my day to day school life. Without laughter one class in particular would be a nightmare.  In @ORGANIZATION we are dissecting cats and we are working with a partner, if I was not making jokes and laughing while I worked, my partner and I would have hated each other. We got to choose our partner and work at a lab station with another pair of students, fortunately for me I knew all of the people I was working near and with, and I was friends with all of them. we had to wear gloves and suits so we didn't get fluids or ""cat juices"" on us. First, we had to skin the cat, of course there is more than one way to do this, you can cut, slice, rip, and pull to remove the skin. Then we had to view and identify the muscles this was especially hard because we could not tell where one muscle begins and another ends. Next we had to remove the muscles and identify the bones and digestive organs. After we identified the bones and digestive organs, we had to remove them and view the stomach, liver, intestines, and kidneys. We had to cut open the stomach, intestines, and kidneys to look at the structure of them. lastly, we had to remove the heart and lungs. The class was told we are doing dissections for about a month and it has only been three weeks. You can only imagine how horrible and fascinating it is and how much I need laughter to keep myself together and from going insane. My friends keep me from breaking into tears and keep me laughing.  Dissecting cats in @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION was challenging not only physically, but mentally challenging as well. It stressful, fascinating, and gross, and without the jokes and the laughter I do not think I would have never made it through it. My friends support there when I needed it guided me through the terrible assignment. So as you can clearly see, without laughter I would not be able to do some of the day to day things I do at school.",18,20,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12938,21578,8," A couple years ago when I was in middle school I meet one of my bestfriend which who I have great times with. When I first meet her was in math class where she had an assigned seat next to me. We started talking and eventhough we did'nt know each other very well i could say laughter was the closest distance between me and her. We would just laugh at really random things that happened because we did'nt really know what to talk about. Sometimes it would'nt make sence of what we were laughing about. But we laughed any way eventhough we did'nt understand each others jokes.Laughing was something that keped our distance close. Time went by and we became good friends. Laughing was the one thing that keped us cose together because we had nothing better to do. We both are people that like to laugh a lot and if not we get bored. If me or her had no humor when we first meet I don't think we would of got along so well at the end. We did'nt really have anything to do because we did'nt know each other very good. We would only hang out during lunch and any other class we had together but all we did was laugh at what we thought was funny which was really dumb. We had nothing better to do.  A couple months latter we seemed to become really close friends and not just in laughter. We knew each other much better and finally had things to talk about and we found out we had something in common. Laughter still had something to do with our friendship but not as much as the begining of when we first meet. During math time we were always talking and laughing at the things we would say. That had never happened before. But now we were able to talk about other things too not just things that made us laugh and we new that laughter is'nt the only thing that is keeping us colse together. Now we had other ways to get along too. We both had friends that we could get along with differenlty. I had some friends with not a really close distance but we would laugh a lot. With some of my other friends I did'nt really laugh that much and we had a very close friendship. My friends and I can get along in different ways not just in laughter. We all have differents ways to get along and have fun. Some of them are really calm and some of them like to laugh a lot like me. Mostly all of the are just the type that like to be laughing all the time but we are closer because of the way we are with each other.  I think that laughing could be the shortest distance between two people. There are other things that can keep two people close together. Laughing does help people have a good time together but I don't think is a big, big part of a friendship. I think its how they get along and if the have somethings on common. It also depends on how they get along and how they treat each other. Everybody has a different way of what keeps them close to a friend so I think it's different for everybody.",16,16,0.0,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.0
12939,21579,8,One day when i was going to school with my friends i step t in dog poo and all of my friends laughed at me and it was so embarrassing and i was so mad that my shoes was dirty and now i had to go back home and clean my shoes that i just got for my birthday and now i had to tell my mom that i got dog poo on my shoes and when i told my mom was not mad at me i wood think that she wood be mad at me because she worker t to get the money to pay for my shoes.The next day i went to school all of my friends laughing at me i just went to my class and sat down and stared my math work and when my best friend came up to me and said did you really step in dog poo and she gave a peace of paper that had a dog pooping on a girl and i got so mad i stared craning.When i went home after school mom ask me how school ?

12940,21581,8," Laughter to me seems like the foundation of a relationship; if it is a relationship with your parents, best-friend, or your spouse, it can all be formed with a single laugh or giggle. I have seen on @CAPS that when a guy try's to ""pick up"" or ""hit on"" a girl, most of the time he will try to be funny to ""break the ice"". When that so called ""ice"" is broken the air is open for both people to start showing each who they are.  My best friend and I have been friends for five years now and I hope that we will be friends for more years to come. @PERSON (my best friend/and only friend) has shown me how to be myself @PERCENT, with her and try to with others. Together @PERSON and I have had many funny adventures together, that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Just recently @PERSON and I went snowboarding at @LOCATION in @LOCATION. @CAPS was her second time going snowboarding and I have been snowboarding for about three years now. I promised her that I would stay and help her on the slopes until she got the hang of the board under her feet, I also promised that I would fall down with her when she fell. When we got there I showed her how to clip her bindings on, what the stomp pad was used for, and also how to skate. The word skate means that your foot boot is in the front binding and your left foot is not, you push your back foot on the snow to slide or skate on to the ski lift. It took us three hours to get down the first bunny hill slope, normally it takes a person no more than ten minutes to get down. While teaching, laughing , and bonding with @PERSON I noticed that when I laugh with her I get feelings of love, caring, and happiness. Laughing with her always makes my day. In fact that is how we became friends; was by laughing together. After we got of the slope she said some words to me that I will not forget, ""@CAPS you are the best friend I could ever ask for, if you were a man I would marry you and have your children, I love you."" @CAPS meant a lot to me, for @PERSON is the kind of person that keeps her feelings of love and caring inside. @CAPS was the first time she has ever said she loves me. Laughing together for five years now has made it so that @PERSON feels more open with me, enough to say something that she never told to her family. Laughing and even giggling together is what @PERSON and I look forward to in our relationship. ",20,18,36.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12941,21582,8," I am so good at making people laugh, @CAPS is just one of my very awesome qualities. I have lots of stories of when I have maid people laugh. One time i was on my way to camp with some of my friends and I looked out the window and saw a sign. ""@CAPS butts, unless, that ""@CAPS"" is an ""@CAPS"" @CAPS @CAPS must be @CAPS @CAPS."" I said. @CAPS was so funny i maid everyone in the car laugh. @CAPS later on, on the drive to camp with my friends we stopped at @CAPS in some city. When we stopped there I got inside a shopping basket and my friends and I were racing down the isles and maid all the other costumers laugh. When we where going to leave I bought a whole bunch of food. When we were back inside the car I crabbed the box of doughnuts I had bought and let everyone else in the car have one. We all started eating them and we had established that the doughnuts where really gross. The doughnuts tasted so dry, @CAPS was like they didn't even have any frosting on them. I opened my chocolate milk and I had to drink my chocolate milk with my doughnut just to make @CAPS taste a little bit more sweet. None of us had anymore doughnuts. @CAPS was so funny, we threw the doughnuts out the window. On the way back from the camp that we had gone to, my friend @PERSON was driving home and I sat behind him and I messed with him so much. I had turned my phone up onto its highest volume and played a scary ring-tone and I scared him and maid him jump. @CAPS I had licked my finger and put @CAPS inside his ear @CAPS he freaked out, because he thought @CAPS was really gross. After that he had his window open and I opened my window and stuck my hand around and grabbed his arm and scared him. @CAPS we had stopped by the store in some small town and god some soda and I bought a soda to drink. When we got back in the car and left I Said: ""@CAPS't get pulled over, I just opened a beer. Haha."" @CAPS I took a drink of my soda and as I took the drink I started laughing again and some of my soda went up into my nose @CAPS I said: ""@CAPS burns so bad. My nose is burning."" All of us where laughing. The ironic part was that like thirty minutes after i had said that we got pulled over. We where driving down the highway and my friend @PERSON who was driving thought that the speed limit was sixty-five miles-per-hour but the speed limit was fifty-five. The cop pulled him over and clocked him doing seventy-five. I was gonna try and make the cop laugh, to see if we could lighten him up a little, but my friend @PERSON said no because he was so mad. He ended up getting a ticket and the cop was a real idiot. He looked at the license plate and @CAPS turned and asked @PERSON if they where @LOCATION plates, when clearly they said right on them @LOCATION. Everyone in the car laughed so hard @CAPS was hilarious. The cop was really dumb. I @CAPS't think that anyone who went with me to camp that weekend stopped laughing. I am so good at making people laugh, @CAPS is just one of my very awesome qualities.",19,15,0.0,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0
12942,21584,8," Laughter... what is laughter? Do you expect me to tell you what laughter is? I wish I could but I can't, describing laughter is like describing what water taste like or feels like (besides using the word wet) it's just one of those things that you think its easy to describe to someone because it's a part of your every day life but in reality it's one of the most complex things there could be out there.Even though I can't describe it I do have general concept of it.  Now there's many reasons to laugh or the type of laughter or the feeling behind it. In my case I believe I'm a person that @CAPS @CAPS laughs once a day. I laugh all the time from my friend falling , hearing a joke , remembering something in the past , from just pure exhaustion (yes I laugh @CAPS times when I'm just so worn out and stressed) the list go's on and on. In short I live my life laughing every day. I don't think I'm such a happy go lucky person that makes others laugh alongside her, but I have gotten comments from my friends saying that's the case. This is one of the wonders of laughter if you see someone laughing enjoying their time you just somehow end up laughing along side them. It makes me happy when I hear one of my friends say "" oh @PERSON you just made my day..."" why? It makes me happy because I know that, that friend just now I was able to make even if just a little a nice day. One time in my life though I met someone, someone that now I hold very dear, someone who I just can't picture my life without that someone would be right to say he lost his laughter. It was @DATE, and my friend @CAPS had invited me to The @CAPS @CAPS in @CAPS to meet up with some of her @CAPS friends. The reunion with her friends was @CAPS this coffee shop. I knew no one but her so i felt out of place. So after just sitting back like a wall flower I decided to go to the ice cream shop just next to the coffee shop and when I realized one of the boys in our group decided to come as well. We hanged out he told me about himself I told him about myself as well.  After that day we stayed connected we had long hour conversations through this video calling site called @ORGANIZATION. We chatted in @CAPS @CAPS every singled day, and pulled all nighters on the phone just talking to each other. After around a month of talking and staying connected we became more close, close enough for him to talk about more serious matters with me.   Well now this boy I hold very dear to me has had such a hard life. Where could I possibly begin to tell you the hardships his been through. Oh what about the fact that his adoptive ...hhmmm nah many people out there are adopted that's not that harsh for most. Okay what about the fact that his adoptive father abused of him every chance he got and his adoptive mom literally sat back and watched him do it, not good enough? Okay what about the fact that the one thing that kept him going his friend, the one that was all ways next to him. His to say child hood friends, the child hood friend you can do @CAPS in the world yet would not judge, would not think the worst of you if you did something to be ashamed of, the one that was willing to stay up with you for days in a row just for you not to cry your self to sleep. That friend of him passed away in a car rec in his second year of middle school. His life consisted of waking up in the mornings walking to school and being ignore by everyone around him. Coming back from school and putting up with your adoptive family screaming @CAPS him, called him names ending up to being beaten just because they can.  Do you think he laughed? Well actually he did but, his laugh was not a laugh of joy. Even though he laughed it was as if nothing no feeling what so ever was behind that laugh a robotic laugh. This for me is such a hard thing to stand. It tears me up because this person is someone very dear to me his such a wonderful individual his just now part of my life and I cant see him out of it now. Yet he is suffering he cant even laugh and feel joy. Up to this day I still see him and I have decide that one day for sure I will make him laugh. We laugh when we talk but I want him to experience the laugh he has yet to have experience and I know one day for sure he will.",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12943,21586,8," When I think of laughter you think of memories you shared with people. When I was about six my family and I went to my cousins ranch in @ORGANIZATION. The happest time started with us pulling up to the house as I slowly open my eyes from the long car ride seeing the porch light on. I quickly grabbed up all my toys and some playing cards and waited eagerly at the door for some to answer while the rest of my family are getting the suitcases. My @CAPS @CAPS came to the door first to greet us. I walk under his arm to set down my toys in the living room when I saw @PERSON sleeping on the coach. He was my best friend in the whole world and I always looked forward to seeing him everythime. He had brown hair always wearing wranglers with a trucker hat and his plad tucked in shirt. We always played gold fish together every time I came over, any time of the day. I was so excited to see him I started to run twards him when my other cousin @PERSON grabs me and starts to tickle me tell I fell on the floor and was screaming of laughter. My laughing woke up @PERSON as he came running to me picked me up off the ground and saved me from @LOCATION. He put me on the couch and started watching @CAPS tell I feel asleep.  The next morning I woke up to hear cyotes howling outside while the sun was coming up, when I smelt bacon and eggs coming from the kitchenI shot up to eat breakfast. My dad and all the boys went out to go goose hunting on the farm. Around lunch time while my mom and @PERSON were cooking up some hamburgers the boys all came back in time for lunch. Lunch wasn't ready right then so @PERSON and I startded to play gold fish tell we were told it was time to eat. After lunch we went out to the hay barns to find all the rattle snakes and bull snakes curld up by the bales. Almost every foot step we took there was another snake curld up in the bales. Every time @PERSON would tell me to jump back to shoot the snake in the head. After hunting @PERSON figured we needed a laugh so he grabbed a bull snake and we started to walk to the back yard. I wasn't to sure what he was doing tell we got in the back yard and @PERSON jumped out of her chair and started running to the house. Everyone started to laugh when @PERSON cut her off and she was running in a circle in the back yard. @PERSON finally let her go in the house after about five minutes of giving her a heart attack. We all came back inside to visite in the house. @PERSON and I headed to play more gold fish at the table for the last time of my visit.  The next morning we woke up at five to start working on the farm. I went back to sleep in the tractor tell they were done. When we were done we started loading up all are clothes in the car and gave everyone a hug good bye as I stood by @PERSON not wanting to leave but my mom said I couldn't stay so she picked me up and put me in the car. As we pulled away I looked back to see them all waving good bye.  After we visited @DATE we got a call from my @CAPS @PERSON with some bad news. @PERSON was heading home and saw @CAPS truck on the road but when he pulled up he saw that he killed himself two weeks before he graduated. We went to the funeral that @DATE and when it was all done I sat in @CAPS room and only could remember all the laughs we shared. I knew to always laugh and always to remember the great times I had with one true my best friend. My memory of him hasn't gone away after all these years and because of him I always laugh when I can laugh and live to the fullest. He taught me so much from the little time he was he but whenever I need a laugh I think of the last time I saw him.",18,21,0.0,39,0.0,0.0,0.0,39.0
12944,21587,8,"I think laughter is one of the most important things people need to do in life. The more you laugh in life it makes it so much better and easier. Its better to laugh at something that's bad, like for example falling by someone or even making a simple mistake. It makes life not so difficult and more simple and easy. Laughing can make people happy and enjoy things better and possibly help them look forward to things in the future and help them conquer things that they wanna do in life. One thing that always make me laugh is my family and friends. They make everything easier for me by making me laugh. They don't always say the smartest or funniest thing in the world but it means a lot to me that they do it that. Especially when im not feeling upset or i just happened to not in a good mood, they say something that ll make me laugh and i usually feel a lot better knowing that they made me laugh to make me feel myself again. Most simple things make me laugh more and be happy. Like for example if someone says something totally stupid and know one else laugh's but me. But one thing that normally doesn't make me laugh is if someone got hurt pretty bad, like if they tripped. I wouldn't laugh at that because i wouldn't want someone to laugh at me if i fell and got hurt. I always hate when people brag about stuff that know else knows about that happened to them, like for example if they talk about they did over the @DATE and how ""high"" or ""drunk"" they got. Its really annoying to me and also very pointless because when they talk about it I never pay attention or just walk away because all that stuff annoys the heck out of me. Why would i wanna hear about how your ruining your life? Especially at a young age or even at all. Well that's my story and why i think the benefits or laughter is important.",15,15,0.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12945,21589,8," They say laughter is the best medicine @CAPS I personally think that's true. For one jokes are a great thing fro laughter but it depends on the joke sometimes because some jokes are extremely funny @CAPS some or @CAPS plain horrible. Another reason why laughter is @CAPS great is when your laughing that automatically means that your in a good mood @CAPS i love to be happy or in a good mood i hate being all mad @CAPS upset it @CAPS isn't me. I @CAPS love it when i cant breathe i am laughing @CAPS hard those are the best jokes also you @CAPS about wet your self especially if your extremely ticklish @CAPS i know quite a few people that are @CAPS i feel sorry for them because i would be down right embarrassed if i wet myself in front of anyone. My whole life has had laughter in it to me anytime is laughter time.  Well I have quite a few stories about laughter but i am only gonna tell you one @CAPS its one of my favorites its when me @CAPS my friends are all hanging out at at mt grandmas house for my @NUM birthday party @CAPS were all having a great time on the homemade slip @CAPS slide the food @CAPS the drinks (soda of coarse not alcohol). But anyway my cousin @PERSON has these games that he came up with like the @CAPS relay , @CAPS fishing , @CAPS the gum in the whip cream, @CAPS my favorite @CAPS. @CAPS is a game where you @CAPS have as many players as you want @CAPS all the supplies you need are a lot of sting a lot of balloons @CAPS one person to start out as the @CAPS. @CAPS say you have @NUM humans @CAPS one @CAPS all the humans would have balloons tied around their waists @CAPS they all try @CAPS run away from the @CAPS @CAPS the @CAPS hide anywhere inside the boundaries @CAPS it doesn't matter how your balloon pops who pops it or what pops it once it is popped @CAPS your a @CAPS until there are @CAPS humans left @CAPS you start a new game.

12946,21592,8," We all understand the benefits of laughter. Laughter is definitely the most important part of my best friends and I relationship. Without laughter, we couldn't possibly have as much fun together as we do. If I am having a bad day, I can always count on my best friend to make me crack up, and forget about the day I have had. If we are out and about, or just relaxing at home, my best friend and I are always laughing. The end result is usually us both with tear streaked faces from laughing so hard. There are actually quite a few different instances in which I remember laughing particularity hard. This last @CAPS @CAPS's eve for example, it started snowing at around three a.m, so my best friend and I ran outside screaming at the top of our lungs. Snowballs started coming from every direction. During a game of hide and go seek, we decided to bury ourselves in a snow covered leaf pile. Within ten minutes, our legs were freezing. So what did we do? We put on our swim suits and jumped into the bath tub together. Having her there to laugh with me, made the situation a lot better.  Another situation in which I remember being particularly funny, was the entire third trimester of freshman @CAPS. I needed a first period class and the only thing open was intro to manufacturing. I definitely was not looking forward to it, until I found out that my best friend had it with me. We made a bad situation a lot better by laughing at every single stupid mistake we made. Since we are not exactly experienced in the field of metal, there were quite a few mistakes. With out my best friend there to laugh with me, I have no idea what I would have done. I believe that whenever I am in a bad situation, laughter will always help me. One last situation in which laughter helped a lot, is when I used it to cheer up my best friend. A couple of days ago, my friend had, had a really bad day. Things just weren't going her way. After school I could tell something was wrong. I tried talking to her about it, but that wasn't really helping. So, I brought up some of our past experiences together. Within a few minutes she was laughing and I could tell she felt a lot better. Laughter really does help us out of some tough situations. Laughter is by far the most important factor in my best friends and I relationship. Our relationship is mainly based on laughter. Without it, we just wouldn't be as close as we are today. If we need it to cheer each other up, or cure boredom, I know that laughter will always be on our side. ",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

You would think everything would be calm, but it was the exact oppasite.I wouldnt talk to him or even look at him. He was trying so hard to get me to laugh but i just couldnt. I was so furious with him that i thought nothing between us would ever bee the same again. I thought that our three months together was up, and it scared me so much. He left for his trip the next day, and he left without saying a word.       I cried myself to sleep for a week. I knew he was back in town already, but he hadent called or said anything to me. After weeks of wondering and waiting, i could feel th at it was over. I talked to my sister and she told me that he would come around again and i had to be patient. I tried to take her words in my heart and i wanted to believe that it was true. I called his house everynight, but everynight i got the same answer, ""he's not home, but i'll let him know you called"". i wanted to believe that i would hear from him, so to pass the time i kept my self busy with cleaning and going out with my family. A couple of day's of not thinking and worrying about him did me good. I was smiling and laughing again. I felt like i could begin to breath a little and have fun. My sister's advice ended up working cos a week later he called me and told me that he wanted to see me. I told him he could come by @DATE and that i was very excited to see him again. The call ended and i was smiling from ear to ear.            The next couple of day's i was in a complete fenzy, getting everything clean, figuring out what i was going to wear. Everyone thought i was going crazy, but the truth is that i was scared. Scared of what he will say to me, and were we would go from here. Th days seemed to fly by and the next thing i knew, he was knocking on my door. I let him in and he took my by surprise with a big hug. We sepnt hours jsut talking and listening to music. It was as if nothing had ever changed. Before we knew it it was dark out and he was leaving. I walked him to the front of my trailer park, and he sat me down on the side walk and took my hand's. I was shocked and didnt know what to do but listen. He told me that he was sorry for the way he acted and that tonight he realized how much he wanted to be with me, and that he was completely in love with me. I couldnt do anything except cry and laugh at the same time, and soon enough he was laughing with me. I couldnt have asked for a more perfect moment.      It's been six months since @TIME. We are better than ever becuase we have the laughter. It's what help's keep our relationship solid, and it keep's us close. Everyone need's a little laughter in there life. Im glad that i found someone special enough to always keep me laughing. It's like we never stopped. If you ever feel hopeless and like there's nothing for you.

12948,21595,8," Have you ever experienced a time with your friends or family where you laughed so hard your stomach hurt, and your eyes were filled with tears? Laughing is something every person needs. A great laugh can make a persons day and put a smile on their face. If no one laughed the world would be a terribly sad place.  My friends and I are always laughing, to the point where were rolling on the ground, clutching our stomachs laughing. We sometimes laugh over absolutely nothing. I honestly don't know who I'd be if I didn't laugh, or what I would become. I remember this one time when my friends @CAPS and @PERSON, and I were having a off day. We all woke up in bad moods and everything seemed to be going wrong, especially since we were woken up by my mom in the kitchen banging pans and pots around. When we woke up our favorite cereal was gone and so we wanted to go to the donut shop but no one would take us, and even though I realize that's not the end of the world now, it seemed like it then. My brother and sisters, with the @LOCATION blasting and running around the house yelling, were irritating us and we were already mad. The dog and cats, who kept trying to keep sneak in the house, were annoying us too. The weather outside was all gloomy and disappointing. We were all ready done with the day before it had even started.  We eventually decided to get up and get ready. We came up with a plan to walk down to river behind my house even in the poor weather. The river was after our big backyard and past the quad track so it was about a mile away. When we asked my mom if we could go down to the river she said no she didn't want us walking down there by ourselves, which we had already done a few times before. We begged until we knew she wasn't going to let us. That put us yet again in a foul mood. We had to go find something new to do and it didn't seem like there was many options. We lived clear out of town about @NUM miles, not exactly walking distance.",18,18,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0

I got ready for school after getting out of bed. When i got to school every thing seemed like our normal homecoming tell there was a announcement on the intercoms that had told every body out of no where there was a dance tonight. So after school was done me and my friends were going to head over to our house's to get dressed for the dance. After we were all dressed @PERSON picked us all up and we headed to the dance looking fly.  When we got there every body was looking dressed to dance except one guy, he was wearing corduroy pants with a red tucked in flannel and some brown worn out work boots. We look at him from head to toe and we thought to our self are we in a messed up hillbilly dream? That was just the beginning of what was yet to come. As every body started to get in grove of the beat we soon all started dancing to the music the music was good and every body was having a good time even the kid with the flannel. But just as every thing was going good a song came on that was called cotton eyed @CAPS when the flanneled kid heard this song he almost jumped out of his corduroy pants he soon stared kicking and swinging his feet and arms like if they had no bone or joints in them. Every body started to form a circular around the kid and every body was laughing and copying the kids movement even us. He didn't rely care he just kept dancing and singing to the song. The funnest thing about this was that the dance was a formal one and yet this kid manged to pull off wearing a flannel, some boots, and a pair ofcorduroy pants this kid was out of his mind in fact we still laugh and talk about it tell this day.",15,16,0.0,31,0.0,0.0,0.0,31.0

That trip was the bast @PERSON worst hunting experience of my life. it was the worst because we shot @PERSON missed at two bears @PERSON one of the biggest bucks of my life. But it was the best because we all reached that tired state when every little thing was funny.

12951,21599,8," I sat at the table, speechless, as they told me their story. The @CAPS had been through a lot in the past seven years. @PERSON's youngest son was born three weeks early and the doctor told her he would only live for three days at the most. As she told me, she stared off into the distance as if she were reliving the moment. She told me that her baby, @PERSON, had a rare disease. Half of his brain was smooth, instead of the the normal rigid. She told me about those first days and how scared she was. Seeing @PERSON next her was the only thing that kept me from bursting into tears. He had lived longer. @PERSON told me about how as @PERSON grew older he couldn't walk. His pediatrician told her that @PERSON would never be able to take his first steps and would have to live life confined in a wheel chair. @PERSON was given another miracle. He walked. With the aide of a camouflage cane he beat the odds once again. @PERSON told me about how @PERSON couldn't talk. He only speaks through sign language. She also taught me how to take care of him. He was a normal kid who liked to play with cars and @CAPS. He wasn't any different then the rest of the kids. This was going to be a roller coaster of a week.  I had only met the @CAPS early that @TIME when they had arrived to @CAPS @CAPS, a @DATE @CAPS for disabled kids. I had only known them for a few hours and they were telling me their life story. I got the next week to become best friends with @PERSON. We went swimming in the river, played with sticks, went on nature walks, even rode a horse. The smile on @ORGANIZATION's face lit up my day every time I saw it. @PERSON got to experience things that a child of his kind would never be able to in a lifetime. We got to go tubing, ride on jet skis, and fish in a stock pond where we were sure to catch something. Having the best time of our lives we parted each night to bed, him in his cabin, and I in my tent. Each night as I left I could hear the family laughing and talking about how great the day was and how much fun we were having. To be a part of making a child happy was the cherry on top of my @CAPS experience. One event in particular from @CAPS that week will always stay close to my heart. @PERSON had been experimenting around on a tricycle made specifically for children with disabilities. He tried for hours to make it go. No matter how hard her tried he couldn't move. My heart broke when I saw him start to cry. He was so frustrated. @PERSON gave up and moved on to the swings instead. The rest of the day was filled with the look of sorrow and frustration on his face. I wanted to fix it. I had to fix it. He needed to be happy. That night I went to our @CAPS directer, @PERSON, and I told him about what had happened and he brought me to the garage. The garage was so chaotic and unorganized. I didn't quite understand what he was doing until he emerged with a brand new shiny bike. One with foot straps and supportive seat complete with dragons, and a bell. It was the perfect thing. I was so excited to let @PERSON try it out in the @TIME. The next @TIME, after a delicious blueberry pancake breakfast, we set off to try out the new toy. This moment was big for @PERSON and his parents. He was told he'd never walk, or ever be able to ride a bike, or talk. He had lived through miracles before. He could do it again. @PERSON strapped @PERSON on the bike, put a helmet on him and started him off. The anticipation was almost too much. After a few seconds passed, the wheels began to turn. @PERSON was riding a bike. Tears streamed down our faces, this was the greatest moment of @ORGANIZATION's life. The way he smiled and laughed at his new found capability was a great sight. To be part of something so special was an honor. @PERSON rode his bike all around @CAPS that day. He even rode it into his cabin, and continued to ride in circles around his bunk. I left the family to enjoy their night and went off to bed myself.  The rest of the week was filled with a great deal of fun, but when the end came the goodbyes were hard. We didn't want to leave each other. I had become part of @LOCATION's family, they trusted me and I felt at home with them. @PERSON and I were new best friends and couldn't wait until the next @DATE when we would meet again at @CAPS @CAPS where we could do it all over, and make new memories.",25,22,0.0,47,0.0,0.0,0.0,47.0
12952,21601,8," As I remember back, it was @DATE. It was a hot, humid day. I can remember that day like it was yesterday. I woke up that morning and decided I was going to go swimming. But the only problem was I had no one to go with me, and @CAPS attitude was turning for the worst. The day @CAPS off fairly well for the most part. I called around to all @CAPS friends to see what they were doing for that particular day, but as I went down @CAPS friend line everyone seemed to be to busy to go anywhere with me. I was most certainly bummed. @CAPS happy go lucky attitude turned into the dumps really fast. The only thing that was left for me to do was use @CAPS back up plan, @CAPS aunt. We gathered our swimming gear, blankets, tanning lotion, and ourselves and packed it in the back of the van and headed towards @ORGANIZATION. I was really not in the best of moods, and it seemed that everyone that was around me was turning into a grump as well. Totally bummed that all of @CAPS friends had ditched me and left me to hang with @CAPS aunt all day wasn't @CAPS explanation of fun, sorry enough to say, but it wasn't.  As the day went on the more I thought about @CAPS friends the more I got frustrated. Then finally it came to me, why let their stupidity of ditching (the best thing that had happened to them) me, ruin @CAPS day. I @CAPS laughing and having a grand time, and pretty soon, in all reality forgot why was having a bad day. When we got to our swimming hole, I looked around and noticed that everything was well. Everyone there was having fun. So I @CAPS to loosen up and have a good time. Jumping off rocks, making a fool of myself, laughing, and having a good time. We spent the whole day enjoying with what we had.  When I got home and I had realized what an awesome day @CAPS day had turned out to be, I realized that I shouldn't let @CAPS friends get me down. Laughing and having a good time can make any day turn around for the best. The most important lesson that I have learned from @CAPS experience that day, is to make the best out of each situation. Don't let crushed plans crush your self confidence. Put a smile on your face and turn your frown upside down and laugh. laughter makes life better.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

Her skin was kissed by the sun and flawless in every way. Those lushes ruby red lips looed about as juicy and refreshing as the taste of a freshly picked pink lady apple. From the moment she sat down across from me i couldve sworn i was dreamin. How can any woman look so perfect and exist outside of a movie or game? Thats all i could think of, thats all i wanted to imagine. Just me and her together, but the thought of it was to great to come true I couldnt find a way to bridge this gap i felt between us. Neither of us had ever met or seen each other before and yet still i couldnt resist. it was like when adam was presented with the golden apple from eve. That smile, perfectly straight teeth with that sparkling shine that could blind anyone without sunglasses. Thats when she inally spoke and said ""@CAPS you know the answer to number three?"". I was stunned by her voice. It reminded me of a thousend violins played by angels. my mouth droped and all I could say was ""nope"". I was a complete mook nothing more then a hoser, but then i noticed she was wearing a cross to match her outfit. So I attempted to redeem myself with ""thats an amzing cross ur wearing, what kind of gem is that in the cnter?"". She smiled and batted her eyelashes and told me ""thank you, I like your cross too. mine has a ruby in it"". I smiled back then i got a text message from my friend wth a new joke he wanted me to hear. As I read it I started to burst out laughing. The angel in front of me was then curiouse to what I was laughing about. When i finally finished the joke she too bursted out laughing and I finally gave myself a proper intruduction and told her my name. She was smiling fom ear to ear after the laugh we sared and she told me her name was ""@CAPS"". Ah @CAPS surly it had to be a name given to angels. To this day I still thank my friend who gave me that joke, because if I had not made her laugh then we probably wouldnt have gotten to know each other. If we had not gotten to know each other then she probably wouldnt be my girlfriend. To this day I still feel like the luckiest man in the world and if fate see's fit to split us apart then I will always remember that laughing is the best way to get to know someone.",17,18,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0

Without laughters, the distance between my friends and I would be a big gap, but with laughter, we would not have any distance between us! Then I noticed that the other group of people. Maybe they just had the bad day, they had no amile on their faces. When they sat together, nobody talked or laughed during the lunch time. They seemed they were not friends anymore.

12955,21605,8," Laughter is an integral element to many situations. These situations vary greatly, disasters to the desire to be cheered up to simply wanting to be amused. Humor can make light of circumstances no matter how grave, terrifying or uneasing. The recent earthquakes and subsequent tsunami in @LOCATION made me very worried for my friend @CAPS. He lives in @LOCATION which I at the time I, and many of my other friends thought was close to some of the more affected areas. Of course, we were all scared for him, but we tried to the best of our ability to make light of this disaster. Our fears were made even worse when he never logged onto the ning or facebook, but we know now that was just because electricity was down for him that night (night for us). When we learned he was safe, at least for the time being we were all incredibly relieved. Humor really helped diffuse the situation, as it has many times before. As of now this is still a story in the making because as this is being written there are still great dangers for that region, not the least of which is the threat of nuclear meltdown. The jokes are continuing into the week. I believe humor can be very helpful during worrying times because making light of a serious situation in a way, makes it feel less serious.  Of course many people look down upon doing this, which is completely understandable. They either don't see that we are legitimately fearful or don't understand and believe we're just joking about it to be ""edgy"" or ""offensive"". People who feel the need to joke about dangerous situations aren't intent upon being malicious or uncaring, they, most often, are people with with a sense of humor and a sense of distress.",18,18,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0

She was running hot laps back and forth all around the room and the more she did that the harder I laughed. It was like the most funniest thing I have ever experienced in my life.

So @PERSON and I went down stairs to see if her mom @CAPS knew why @PERSON was acting so ridiculous. She had no clue. So then we went and asked her dad @PERSON, and he was convinced the dog was just crazy. Obviously the dog had some issues, but that wasn't the problem because @PERSON never usually acted this hyper before. Then @CAPS, @PERSON's sister came down stairs and told us to shut the dog up, but we couldn't. @PERSON was running to fast to catch her and was way to crazy to try and calm her down. So we took @PERSON back in @ORGANIZATION's room and just laughed and laughed because there was nothing else to do but to sit there and wonder what the heck was wrong with this dog.

Eventually, @PERSON, the janitor, came out, spotted him and quickly called @NUM. The ambulance hustled to come pick him up and rushed him to the hospital for emergency care. As soon as they got there, they found out he had had a heart attack. He'd had a couple minor ones before this one. However, this heart attack was big. It took his life and they weren't able to revive him. @PERSON was pronounced dead on the day of @DATE.  Our principle called for an emergency assembly when we all had arrived at @ORGANIZATION that @TIME. We had known something was wrong, considering the strange looks on all of our teachers' faces. All the students gathered together in the small gym of our @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION. The air was filled with anticipation as we waited for something to happen. After a bit, a man we all knew walked out in front of us with a microphone in his hand. With slumped shoulders and a grim face, @PERSON, our principle, told us of the tragic news. My mouth fell open and I gasped. I could hear people adjusting in their seats and murmuring among themselves as they struggled to take in the devastating news. Looking around, I saw the same shocked expressions on @CAPS of my classmates' faces. I didn't know what to do. I wanted to cry, but I couldn't just yet. @PERSON explained the situation further as we intently listened to the sickening words coming out of his mouth. I was in shock. I didn't believe that @PERSON was gone.  After our principle was finished speaking, we were ushered out of the gym by melancholy teachers and told to report to our first period class. As I made my way to my locker, I heard sobbing, but it was mostly silent. I quickly grabbed the folder for my first class and closed the locker, wanting to get out of the hallway and into a more private area. Walking into the classroom, I sat at my desk. People in my class filed in through the door and took their seats as well. Our teacher for that class didn't talk to us, so we presumed we weren't doing anything. Sitting there in silence and feeling helpless I put my head down on my desk and started to cry. It really happened, I thought to myself. The reality of the @TIME was setting in.  By the end of first period, the sleeve of my sweatshirt was drenched in tears and mascara. Nobody had really said anything, but that was okay. Seeing that I had been crying, people stopped to hug me as I sluggishly walked down the hallway to my second period class. I expected my next class to be a lot like the first, but it wasn't. In place of the cold silence, was the soft sound of music. Instead of crying by themselves, people were being comforted by friends. Students were making cards for @PERSON's family. We were all reminiscing the good times we had with @PERSON. We retold the stories he told us of his life in the classes he taught. We remembered the funny crack he would get in his voice when he raised it in even the slightest way. We laughed when we remembered how he couldn't hang up anything straight and that the evidence was on his classroom walls. For the first time in that already long day, we felt alright. We felt as if we could celebrate his life, not mourn it.  The rest of the day was alright. Not because we lost a great teacher, but because we could love and appreciate a great teacher. Laughter eased the pain and sorrow of that dreadful day. We could remember and laugh about the good times we had in the classroom with him throughout our @CAPS. @ORGANIZATION and @ORGANIZATION years. We could remember the man @PERSON was through the small tickle in our bellies. Laughter brought us together in a time of need.",25,23,0.0,48,0.0,0.0,0.0,48.0
12958,21608,8,"One thing that people in the world love to do the most is laugh. Why is it that we like to laugh? Laughter is every important in our lives because it brings us joy, happiness, and most of all it just fills our stomachs with butterflies. One major thing that about laughter is the whole point of view. Of course everyone makes jokes, dorky things, or simply a funny comment. All those things cause laughter, sometimes laughter helps people grow a good relationship and it builds up to be strong.  In relationships like boyfriend/girlfriend, parents with their children, family, or even friends have to have some laughter in their relationship because if not then that would be a boring relationship. At times it's hard to bring laughter in the picture but we at least need to try to laugh it is healthy for us to laugh once in a while. In families its important to grow a relationship with the child or parents and they need some funny feelings in their stomachs that make them giggly inside and its all could laughter. Friends always will have funny moments to laugh about, it's sometimes the pranks that they do to each other, the funny comments, the jokes and it's easy as that to start laughing and creating the good relationship with just laughing with each other.   Sometimes laughter could cause bad things if we use for bad things and that could cause a bad relationship. We also don't want to hurt someone's feelings by laughing at them because something that happen or if someone made a comment, because that could leave us not laughing to much after we loose a relationship with someone. The smiles that people have on their faces is a wonderful thing to see. In all relationships laughter is a big thing because it can always come in handle. People have bad days sometimes and we always try to make them happy and how do we do that, well it's called laughing. I know if I was having a bad day and I felt all depressed and mushy I would like someone to make me laugh by simply saying a hilarious joke.  In my personal opinion I love laughing and especially making people around me laugh. At times I have my bad times and need some laughter in my system to make me feel at least better. I know that sadness can sometimes take over but we all need to think positive and not let the negative things take over. Life is so much better if we all have laughter in them. Imagine the world with just laughter, how life would be. i wish that could happen because that would make everyone full of happiness and smiles on the faces.   In my personal life my family and friends are full of laughter. I have to make jokes at times when things are getting diffcult and everyone is freaking out. Laughter is a part of us either we like it or not it's always going to be with us no matter what. Eventually I would say that laughter is a element in my life that I will always carry and I hope that everyone in the world has the element of laughter in them because seriously it's important in this this world.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12959,21609,8," Laughter, to me, is an important aspect of my relationship with anyone. I cherish laughter, and I employ it at every chance that I receive. To many, laughter @MONTH be trivial, but to me, it holds the key to my relationships with other people. Without laughter, many of the wonderful people I have met in my life, might not be their because I used laughter to develop them into friendships.  Friends were hard to come by in my childhood. I did not make good choices, not with whom I associated myself with; rather, with how I approached other people for the first time. I would come off as brash, rude, or annoying, to name a few among many. I had no experience with making relationships, and the first impression is very important. Just like any meal, the first sense that is appealed to, is sight. The image of the meal floods the mind, next, the aroma floats aimlessly towards you, and you begin to salivate in anticipation. And like any recipe, to perfect it, you must practice, and that is what I did. It was a long and arduous process, but come my sophomore year in @CAPS @CAPS, I began to feel like I mastered the art of making other people laugh. As students, and individuals, people come and go, we @MONTH truly end up forgetting their entire being, or we @MONTH leave an impression on their mind. I try this through laughter; to be remembered if not, only for a day. Using laughter, I acquired new opportunities to make friends, and I did not squander those opportunities. I surrounded myself in a net of laughter, I developed the necessary skills to make people laugh. I enjoyed it, and I still do. One relationship that I built, is with a young women. I had never spoken to her before, until our teacher put us into a group together. Laughter was the essential building block of our future relationship. I was myself, I would not pretend to be someone I'm not, I would express puns that our youth are so fond of, euphemisms our generation know all to well. We would listen to the same music, and gradually, our relationship was nurtured into a stead-fast friendship. It has developed to the point were, in class, we long for each others company. We look for classes to have together because we love to make each other laugh. And because of laughter, I have made a friend with whom I share secrets, time, and moments with which I shall forever cherish. Recently she has decided to start playing tennis. Needless to say, I was ecstatic. I would like nothing more to help her, and whomever so decides to partake in my leadership. I do not necessarily claim to be the best, but I am confident in my abilities to teach the techniques, and fundamentals of the game. Their is not much more I would like to do, that is to play the sport that I love, with the women I love. And most of the credit belongs to laughter because, when her amiable face lights up from something I said, it means all the world to me, whether she knows it, or not. I have many such connections with other people from both sexes, but none so much as hers. I worked hard to build connections with other people because they would make life that mach easier, and that much more enjoyable. In @CAPS @CAPS their are no exclusive social groups, or roving bands of football players ready to pick out the weakest of the student population. We are all friends, we are all one community, we all belong, and that is due, in part, by laughter. Laughter connects people from around the world, it is the universal language every race, skin color, and religion all speak. It can bring us together or it can tear us apart, but in life, the medicine most prescribed, is laughter.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12960,21610,8," People always say that the worst parts of life are the sad parts, the moments where no one is there to make you laugh or smile. These sad moments trump the problems caused by work, or by the society, and show how important laughter is in our lives. A time when someone is feeling joy so strong that it pours out of them in the way of a suppressed giggle or booming laugh, are the times that make life worth living, worth the jobs and the bad breakups and the over priced society. It has been said by those infamous ""they"" that your worst most tragic moments are the ones remembered forever because they hold the most emotion, but i have to disagree with ""them"". Moments in the life whether they be seconds, hours, weeks or years, can be cherished also if they are built up by the bonds of love and laughter. Just recently was my birthday. This year it fell on a @DATE and I had made no plans to celebrate in any way. Sure my parents had gotten me loads of presents but the joy and jittery excitement that i had always felt previous to my birthday wasn't in me. These feelings were most likely because this year i had decided that now that i was in high school, birthday parties were a no go. With no plans or exciting activities to await, my birthday was not eagerly looked forward to as it had been every year previous. What would i do?! I definitely didn't want to spend the day home in my pajamas with my parents and two sisters, that's what i did almost every other normal @DATE. These thoughts and realizations brought that sad lonely feeling in me, those feelings that make up the worst parts of life. My mom, noticing my birthday gloom, suggested a trip to the beach and a one night stay in a yurt. I love the beach, I would even go as far as to say that its my favorite place in the world. I also love yurts. Yurts are big round cabins made from canvas draped around a wood structure, with a skylight directly at the top of the pointed roof where you could see the stars at night. Staying in a yurt at the beach sounded better to me then being at home, so naturally I agreed to the beach trip. Way deep down I was excited, I was thrilled, a beach trip with my family! In my head I was stuck still in my foggy state of gloom as thoughts swirled in my head about how I would not have a good time if there were no friends to laugh and hang out with, and how much of a loser I was for not doing anything with friends but instead my family. Our household consists of my mom, dad, and two sisters ages four and @NUM months. We are not the most well functioning family. I find my older sister to be an annoying brat sent by the devil to ruin my life and make everything my fault. Two out of the three of us girls have to always be in some kind of brawl, and that drives my mother crazy which gets her all flustered and my dad angry until we realize that buzz light year has ruffled all of our feathers. This scene is exactly what I imagined my family birthday beach trip to turn out like, but caused by a long car drive and hungry kids rather than buzz light year.  The day approached and we woke early to pack our bags and pack the car. My mom, bless her, made a family announcement to us that today was my day and anything I wanted was what I got. This meant that I got to choose what we would eat, what we would do and could make any comment including telling my little sisters to bug off if i wanted to. By lunch, we had visited the beach, gotten settled in our yurt, and enjoyed a lunch made up of various snacks we had brought along and I found that I was enjoying myself. No one had fought all day, raised a voice, make a snarky comment or do anything to upset the happy atmosphere we were in. I was laughing. As we visited the aquarium with all its odd fish i laughed. I laughed at my sisters when they were doing silly things. I laughed at the things my mother told me. We all laughed at a bicyclist running into a pole, and fish doing vacuum like motions with their lips. All the laughing, all the smiles did a lot for me. It pushed those negative thoughts straight out of my mind and told them never to come back. Laughing helped me to see all of the love that circled around in my family, it made the love visible. Its healthy to laugh. Without laughter in our lives, some things like love, that can sometimes be invisible, become visible again through laughter. ",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12961,21611,8," Why is it that people can look back at something and laugh, but not while the action is taking place? For example, if you were to witness someone being hit by a car. During that event, nobody would be laughing. There would most likely be people rushing frantically for help and ambulances everywhere. But we see people get hit by cars all of the time on the @CAPS and it is considered comedic. On a hot @DATE @TIME, something quite similar happened to me and my friends.  I live next to the @LOCATION. I know of this one spot on the @LOCATION, its called @ORGANIZATION @ORGANIZATION. It has a pretty strange name due to the fact that the water is actually a greenish color because the reflection of the tree's that surround it. The @LOCATION is about thirty yards wide, nobody knows how deep it is because it is impossible to touch the bottom. The main attraction is a cliff-side, which ranges from @NUM feet too @NUM feet. On the other side of the @LOCATION, there is a beautiful, golden beach with massive tree's behind it. The hike to @ORGANIZATION is about one mile of steep decline, which leads right to the cliff's edge. The @LOCATION bed and the gorge is lined up just the way that it is shaded for most of the day, except in the mornings.  On this particular day, I was going to bring @CAPS, @PERSON, @CAPS, and @PERSON. My friend @CAPS is a dare-devil. Although he's not very good at athletic things, he is willing to try just about anything. He was also home-schooled until freshman year of high school, so he's also pretty socially awkward and definitely not used to resisting resisting negative peer pressure. On the other hand, I am the kid to do crazy things, but I can pull them off. I was doing gainers off of the cliff's edge that was only about @NUM feet off the water. Somehow, @CAPS ended up getting pressured into trying one as well. As he was getting mentally prepared for this stunt, we all gave him a count down. @NUM, @NUM, @NUM, @CAPS! We all shouted at the same time. He ran to the cliff-side, just like I showed him, he jumped out, then brought his knee's to his to his chest. Nothing happened! That was the problem, @CAPS tucked but he never rotated. He fell like a rock. His back aimed strait at the water. There was what seemed like a @NUM second pause between the moment he jumped off the cliff and the moment he smacked the water. His upper back was the first thing to make contact with the water, there was a giant splash, and the sound of a clap almost as loud as a small firecracker. @NUM seconds later, @CAPS emerged from the water, he was attempting to breathe but no air was entering his lungs. @PERSON, @CAPS, @PERSON, and I were all on the shore of the beach across the lake! Simultaneously, we looked at each other, nobody was laughing, everyone looked worried. All at once we booked it into the water. It was about a @NUM yard swim to get all the way to @CAPS. I was the first one there. He was panting by then, but he was still in an intense state of panic. I stayed away from him until @PERSON got there. @PERSON is almost 6'@NUM and @NUM pounds, so he grabbed @CAPS around the torso first. I grabbed his legs, when @CAPS and @PERSON finally got there they took hold of his arms. We all pulled him to the beach where he could safely put his feet on dry land. Who knows what would have happened if the panicked @CAPS would have made it to the beach all by himself. Although, it was kind of @CAPS fault for pressuring him in the first place.  After almost @NUM hours of basking in the in the sun and calming down, the sun started setting behind the gorge, there were shadows closing in on us from the shoreline. It was only @NUM @LOCATION. We decided to explore down the @LOCATION a little bit, also to find some more sunshine. We all stood up and noticed that @CAPS's entire backside was purple! Not only because of his ginger skin, but the impact on the water created quite the contusion. Everyone except @CAPS saw it and busted out laughing at the memory of what had previously just happened. @CAPS looked behind him and saw his discolored back and couldn'@CAPS hold back bursts of laughter. Laughter was coming from everyone.  This was the first time that @CAPS, @CAPS, @PERSON, @PERSON, and I had ever hung out. Laughter was what brought us together. Now we share @CAPS @LOCATION spot with all of @CAPS own other friends but nothing sticks out to me like that day did. To this day we all still reminisce about that hot @DATE day at @ORGANIZATION when @CAPS attempted a gainer off the cliff. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two (or five) people.""

12962,21613,8," Before my best friend moved away, we would stay up at night just laughing for no reason at all. I don't know what would get us started, but it would not stop until our stomachs hurt so bad from laughing that we just fell asleep. On these nights, her mom would come in around @TIME and ask us nicely to please quiet down, which just made us laugh more. When we are together, it is quite dangerous to be around. We have gotten so close that we are practically sisters in a way. Laughter is important in all of my relationships. I grew up in a large family where laughter is key, and positive attitudes were expected.  Over the @DATE, @CAPS and I work together, so we have lots of time to get our thinking on the same track. If we are on a short car ride and we want to go somewhere, we make it happen. We are very good at manipulating our elders, a skill acquired from years of practicing on @CAPS. All it takes is one look to see what the other is plotting, then a laugh will follow, letting the manipulated know that it is doomed, or very soon to be. Our schemes are generally harmless, possibly just a little side ache from being tickled too hard. It does not help that we are both small, strong, and packed full of energy, just waiting for the right person to come along. @CAPS and I find ways to stir up mischief all around us, whether it be jumping out from behind corners or taking the manager's keys.  When I go somewhere, I am generally aiming for positive places with an upbeat atmosphere and people that make me happy. I dislike and avoid places I don't enjoy, I am one to make jokes or be sarcastic when things are too quiet or too serious. Serious environments intimidate me, @CAPS are out of my comfort zone. Laughter brings people together, and it lightens people's moods. Nobody likes the awkward situations where no one is saying anything, so I generally will break the silence with a blond joke or something.  I was flying home to @ORGANIZATION from @LOCATION, @CAPS and met a couple great people on the way. When I boarded the plane I looked around for a place to sit then decided on the seat between an elderly woman and a man who resembled my father (I was alone on the flight). I thought, for the next hour I will be with these people, so I had better make it something to remember. The man had helped me get my carry-on into the overhead storage, which was very nice of him. The elderly woman and I started talking, and the subject of horses came up, and when horses come up in conversion, @CAPS are usually paired with lots of falling stories. She talked about this @CAPS horse called @CAPS @CAPS, how he had a mind of his own, and how he would do things his way. The problem with horses is this: @CAPS know that @CAPS are a slight deal bigger than us, and can really do as @CAPS please, but most choose to listen as @CAPS don't like to be corrected. I told about my first few rides, and how I didn't know much besides how to steer the massive animal beneath me. Before we knew it, we were landing in @LOCATION, and my new friends got off the plane.  When my plane landed in @LOCATION, I figured I would be flying to @ORGANIZATION sitting alone. After a few minutes, a teenage girl got on and sat next to me. The first thing she did was offer me a piece of gum, which I accepted. The first bit of the ride was quiet, but after awhile the crying baby got annoying to listen to so we started talking. She was flying to @LOCATION to her dad's house. We talked about our families and hobbies, and had a good time. After we flew into @ORGANIZATION, I welcomed myself back home, I was back in the eternal rain state, and couldn't see anything besides clouds out of my window. Laughter is all around us, and there are always things to laugh about, look on the bright side of life. People are more attracted to those who can make them laugh, so get a sense of humor and you will be in good company. Giggles and smiles make the world go around, so keep laughing.

When we got to the house that @TIME is was so beautiful the snow was falling and @CAPS was coming down so hard @CAPS looked like white cotton balls and the snow on the house was just amazingly marvelous I mean @CAPS seriously looked like @CAPS could have belonged in a story book as a princess castle. When we got in the house @CAPS was really relaxed and nobody really wanted to do anything we all pretty much fell asleep on the couch.  The next morning when we woke up we were all eating breakfast and watching the snow @DATE, there was a knock on the door, so of course I had to @CAPS get @CAPS because my @CAPS was ""too tired"" so i got up and went and opened the the door and three huge boys came in and picked me up now at first i was like ""@CAPS who are these boys?"" but then after they took their hoods off i noticed @CAPS was my cousin @PERSON, his best friend @PERSON and his other friend @CAPS. So they carried me back to the table and sat me down and @CAPS was funny because my whole @CAPS was laughing so hard they couldn't breathe and i still had a horrified look on my face.  They yelled""@CAPS"" and then went out back and started building snow ramps to snowboard off of. So i got dressed and went out back with them and at first they were like ""@CAPS great she is out here"". And they usually give me a lot of attention but they weren't so i decided i needed more attention so when they weren't looking i went and sat down and the snowboard ramp the had built and of course @PERSON knew why i was doing @CAPS but @CAPS and @PERSON were still clueless so of course they told me to get off but i told them ""@CAPS"" and that irritated them so @PERSON said ""@CAPS girl if you don't move i am going to jump over you"", well of course i was super mad at this point and wanted to see if he would actually do @CAPS so i told him ""@CAPS ahead"" @PERSON started to @CAPS but then @PERSON grabbed him,@CAPS him off the snowboard and started yelling at him @CAPS the time the whole argument was over, witch @CAPS the way lasted almost the whole day. I went to bed @TIME and @PERSON@NUM and @CAPS went to the bar and the next morning I was told to sleep in but i was woken up at seven o'clock @CAPS @PERSON and @CAPS screaming at @PERSON to get up but they didn't get him up they got me up I was so mad I felt like a mama bear who just got woken up in the middle of hibernation. @CAPS was so irritating to be a house with three hungover twenty-one @DATE old's but i had fun anyways, That @TIME they were not home @CAPS god but with them not there is was peace and quiet so we played @CAPS and @LOCATION, @CAPS was so much fun we had a blast. The next morning wasn't all that fun because we had another @CAPS, @CAPS us. I swear i was so irritated I wanted to pounce on them like and angry tiger getting ready to catch her prey. So i tried to stay away as much as possible, witch was kind of hard because they all love me but i just decided to lock myself in my room for the day to avoid them, @CAPS kind of sucked but @CAPS was a lot better than having them yell in my ear every five seconds. The day after we cleaned and started getting ready to leave, @CAPS was not fun at all but my @CAPS made sure i was cleaning and we ate three meals and after every meal we cleaned again but that @TIME we went to bed and you didn't hear a peep out of anybody because we were so tired but the next morning we left at seven o'clock and started driving back to @LOCATION @CAPS was so fun being at @LOCATION we have made @CAPS a tradition but we weren't able to @CAPS this @DATE because of winter formal but we are definitely going back this @DATE and we will have twice as much fun as we did two ears ago!",15,17,0.0,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.0
12964,21617,8," Morose and somnolent, I woke up. I woke up to go to @LOCATION. Going to @LOCATION to watch a few basketball games, I was. Although I was unable to partake in the activity because I was @CAPS injured in the previous week of practice. Unfortunately though, I still had to go and support my friends and teammates. It was about @NUM o'clock when we all got onto the bus and set off to @LOCATION. All of my friends were mirthful and talkative; but me on the other hand, I was in a lackadaisical stare. The bus ride seemed to last a whole lifetime; but in two hours we arrived at our destination. @LOCATION had a nice school; but we were all about to find that it sometimes resembled a ghost town. The high school seemed lifeless in comparison with other schools we had played at in the past. There was nobody around and not a soul to be heard. We all sat there patiently waiting; then, after maybe five minutes or so a man showed up and led us to the locker rooms. The boys had to wait till the girls were done playing their game; so, we all went and started shooting on one of the auxiliary courts. Although, sadly due to my injury I could not participate in the activity. They were all having so much fun screwing around down there. Just the thought of not being down there with them made me ill. After the girls game we all went to change. After that we all sat there, joking around and waiting for our coach to come in and give us our pre-game pep talk. It seemed like ages before our coach finally came into the locker room. He talked about what we should and shouldn't do in order to get the win. When the game started I was really getting depressed, but I sucked it up and cheered on my team. The first half of the game was great and we were on top. Although the second half wasn't so great. We only scored six points and ended up losing the game by a large margin. My friends tried to be stoical; but I could tell that they were ashamed. Ashamed of their performance in the second half. This once again made me feel sad and depressed. Next, I had no choice but to go and watch two more games in the old, vulgar, and uncomfortable bleachers of @LOCATION. The first of the two games was a great one; we won by two points. The next game on the other hand, was a very boring one. It seemed to take forever; but the worst of it was the fact that we lost. After that final game I had to wait for my cousin to come out from the locker room. When he did, we went to check out with our coaches; we had to check out in order to ride home with our parents. So off we went; but first we had to get something to eat. Once again, like all the times before we chose to eat at @ORGANIZATION. We went through the drive through, got our food, then pulled over so we could eat. At first everything seemed right; but then my cousin noticed he didn't receive the @CAPS he ordered. So we went in to get the problem solved. Afterwords, we were all kind of joking about the restaurant not getting the order right; then I took a bite of my burger. It was then that I realized I had received a burger without a patty. I was really upset that @ORGANIZATION's made such a silly mistake. So once more me and my cousin went in to the restaurant. When told what the problem was they were all just in shock. They couldn't believe what they had done. So after they all settled down they made me another burger.  Me and and the family were all having a ball about the events at the @ORGANIZATION. It was a great trip home fillled with lots of fun and laughter; which was not what me, my cousin, or anybody else expected.So in the end of my once gloomy day, I found myself stricken with laughter.",18,18,0.0,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.0
12965,21618,8," A while back my mom had decided to send me to @DATE camp. When I heard this I was pretty upset, @CAPS I wouldn't know anyone there. Before camp started I did all I could to let my mom not let me go. After a while of that I knew I wouldn't get my way, and before I knew it I was off to camp. When I got to the place that was taking us to camp, there wasn't a lot of people there.  When I got to the camp I was wrong, there was a lot of people that I didn't know. It was extremely scary, but it was to late to go home now. Walking to my cabin was nerve racking, @CAPS I didn't know who would be in my cabin. Meeting the girls in my cabin was awkward, mainly @CAPS we didn't know each other and secondly our counselor was so weird. Right after meeting each other our counselor made all of us play a game of @CAPS. Playing @CAPS at first with strangers was strange, but after a while we started laughing. We played and laughed for hours and hours, until it was time for lunch. Lunch with the girls was not so scary since we had so muh fun playing @CAPS, but we still didn't really know each other.  When lunch was over the first thing we did was play @CAPS, the more we laughed and had fun the more and more we started to get to know each other. All @DATE we played the silly little game of @CAPS, and just giggled and laughed. @DATE came along the second @DATE of camp and all of us had almost become friend by just laughing and playing @CAPS. We played it so much the first @DATE that we just called it ""@CAPS @CAPS"" instead of @CAPS. Like other things we got tired of @CAPS and went our separate ways for free time. Everyone agreed that free time that @DATE was so boring so we played @CAPS again. Laughing and laughing till our stomachs hurt from laughing so hard, that I think was the @DATE all of us really became friends.  We had become thick as thieves in just a couple of days, we did everything together. We talked,we swam, we played tennis, and most importantly we laughed together. Camp was not what I expected it to be, it was way better. All the girls in my cabin had become friends so fast that it was strange to other people,not realy but it was kind of weird to become best friends in just a couple of days. Camp was flying by for us and before we all knew it it was almost the @DATE. Things were so good, until one of us got sick. I was the one who ended up sick, it was horrible I stayed in bed all @DATE missing everything that was going on. Even worse I had almost lost my voice, laying in bed without laughing with my friends and having fun was just torture. @DATE the @DATE of camp was fastly approaching, and all I could do was stay in bed. @DATE was there, but it was a relief when I could talk again. The rest of the @DATE @DATE of camp I could be out of bed and enjoying camp.  When @DATE time was ending and evening was arriving, we had our cabin party. Our party was so much fun, even though we had to stay inside our cabin. We ate all of our treats we saved from the concession stand, and all of the treats our counselor brought. It was almost @TIME so we had to go to bed soon, @CAPS we where leaving in the @TIME. There was one @DATE thing we had to do, and it was one @DATE game of @CAPS. We played for about in hour, @CAPS another counselor had to come tell us to be quiet.  Looking back at my first year of camp, I always remember how all of us became friends. We still talk about it every year at camp, and we do still play @CAPS. That year at camp I think is one at my favorite memories, @CAPS we all became friends by just playing @CAPS and laughing together.",20,19,40.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0

12967,21620,8," Everyone knows how important a laugh can be. Everyone has a different laugh, it can be powerful and moving or devastating and hurtful. Someone said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I agree with this statement, everyone has a different laugh and and laughs for many different reasons, laughing is so powerful, someone can make you laugh when your upset or unhappy and they could change everything and how you are feeling. Laughing is a way of connecting with others, you laugh when you are having a good time, are hurt and need someone. Laughs are surprising you never know when your going to laugh and for what, it could be from a little joke or a funny elaborate story being told to you.  Over the @DATE I was moving back to @PERSON from @LOCATION, and I was very nervous and scared to be the new kid again. Even though I knew some people from when I used to live here, nothing was going to change the fact that I was the new kid. Not too long after I moved I got reconnected with some old friends of mine that I have known since the second grade when I lived here before. My friends and I are always having a good time, laughing, and just being crazy. All of us girls have been through a lot the past few years and that @DATE, and it was nice to see them and talk to them again after all that has happened to us, we have all gone of and done our own thing and became friends with different people, but we are still close friends after all this time. It was good to spend time with them and see how much they have changed. We have all changed a lot in the past few years. And we @MONTH have fought caused some drama and some of us moved away, but we have been through almost everything together since we were little kids and probably will still be friends through out high school and collage.  @DATE was almost over and school would be starting again me and three other friends of mine wanted to something all together one last time before school started. So we planed to have one big sleepover. one of the friends lives in @LOCATION, and she was able to come out to @PERSON and have this sleepover with us. It was just like second grade again, I don't think I have ever laughed as hard in my life. Not long after we all got there, we were laughing, talking, and having a great time. That night we were all sleeping over, we were thinking of something fun to do, and of my friends decided it would be fun to go @CAPS'ing, so we asked her mom if it was @CAPS and she said as long as we don't go to far way from home and we have our phones on us in case we need to call her and have her pick us up. It was still a little too early for @CAPS'ing, so until we waited for it to get dark, we walked to the store down the street from her house and bought bags and bags of toilet paper. It still wasn't dark or late enough to go, so we watched some movies, went to the mall, and stuck our feet in her hot tub. I was nice being back and being with all my old friends again. We stayed up and finally it was dark and late, so we put on all of the black clothes we owned and disguised our selves so no would could recognize us, we looked pretty convincing. We put on big jackets so we could hide the toilet paper in our jackets and if someone saw us walking they wouldn't see any of the toilet paper. We tried to be quit and sneak up on houses, but it dint work, we were so loud, we could not stop talking or laughing. We were being so loud we couldn't hear some other kids out late on their bikes also. They got closer and close and we realized it was some other guy friends we know from school, they got board and went for a bike ride. They helped us @CAPS some houses and it was getting really late, so we decided to head back.  This @DATE was one I will never forget, we had so much fun and we agreed we have never laughed so much for anything. It was a hard year for all of us and it was great to see some familiar faces and spend time with some true friends like we used to.",18,15,0.0,33,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.0
12968,21621,8," Laughter is an important part of my family. We laugh together, we breathe together, and we'll die together. When it comes to a family the most important thing that brings @CAPS as one besides having fun, loving each other, and spending quality time together is what makes @CAPS laugh and what keeps @CAPS close. For me, my siblings, and parents we always have to have a good time and laugh, whether one is upset or the other is mad. It doesn't matter what the situation is @CAPS's always a time where we have the best times even @CAPS points when one of us doesn't want to see one another. I was spending an adventurous day with one of my close friends, @LOCATION and we decided it was time to go home and get ready so I could go spend the night @CAPS her house. When @LOCATION and I stepped in my house @CAPS was so much commotion going on and yelling that we decided maybe we should sit down and figure out what was going on. As we sat down we began to bust up laughing @CAPS the sight of my step dad, @PERSON yelling @CAPS my oldest sister, @ORGANIZATION. We didn't know what had just happened, but we really wanted to find out. ""I can't believe @CAPS just can't go next door to @PERSON's house and ask for toilet paper when I've been sitting anxiously on the toilet with hope @CAPS would bring me toilet paper for an hour. Yet, they came to our house and asked for our plunger which is far more embarrassing,"" @PERSON said. As soon as those words violently came out of his mouth we started cracking up laughing. It felt like my stomach was tightening so much that I couldn't breathe. With as much attitude as @CAPS can put in your tone of voice, @ORGANIZATION had said, ""@CAPS don't need toilet paper to clean yourself with! @CAPS could have easily hopped in the shower and used the shower head to wash off the poop!"" @CAPS that point @CAPS was no going back @CAPS what she had said. My step dad was furious that she would even say such a thing. Without any hesitation @CAPS quickly picked up the phone and dialed my mothers number. Waiting, and waiting for her to pick up. Suddenly, @LOCATION and I heard a voice on the phone. @PERSON began screaming telling my mom about the situation. It got to a point where @CAPS said some words that @CAPS shouldn't have said. As the words rolled off his tongue @CAPS began to stutter. @CAPS spoke, ""@CAPS was no toilet paper and @ORGANIZATION wouldn't go and grab me some from @PERSON's house. Unfortunately, I had to get up, get my hand wet, and wash my hands after I wiped my butt with my own hand."" @CAPS was no stopping us from laughing as hard as we could. I had never heard of something so disgusting that made me want to throw up all over our leather couches.  @CAPS was so anxious to take my sister's phone away that @CAPS immediately asked for it before confronting my mother about it. @CAPS didn't care even if my mom told him that @CAPS couldn't take it away. @CAPS wanted possession of it so @CAPS knew how my sister would feel. Not only did @CAPS take away her phone, but @CAPS took away her right to use toilet paper after using the bathroom. I don't know how long I laughed over that, but it felt like I was going to pee all over myself. As @LOCATION and I continued laughing @CAPS ran up the stairs as fast as @CAPS could rummaging through all the bathrooms in our house to get every last little square of toilet paper @CAPS was. Sad part was @CAPS even took off the shower head so that my sister wouldn't be able to use that also to clean herself. My mother got home and @CAPS was nothing to say. @CAPS was so embarrassed that we had heard that @CAPS had wiped his butt with his hand. Not only that, but i had put the story as my status on @CAPS and @CAPS had saw. I didn't mention any names besides @LOCATION and I's, but the fact @CAPS knew the story was about him made his cheeks turn as red as a cherry.  @PERSON began to wonder. My sister had said @CAPS was no toilet paper and when @CAPS asked if @CAPS was napkins she also said, ""no."" @CAPS started looking through cabinets and soon found napkins. @CAPS was so mad, but @CAPS the same time laughing really hard. @CAPS felt like @CAPS should look for the brighter side of the situation. A week has gone by and my step dad, @PERSON still hasn't put one roll of toilet paper in the bathroom. @CAPS said, ""@CAPS @MONTH think it's funny when it happens to me, but it'll be funny when @CAPS don't have any toilet paper.""",24,20,0.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.0,44.0
12969,21623,8," laughter is an important part of any kind of relationship like your family, friends, or your other half. Now let me tell you why it is important, there was two weeks left of school and my family had planned out to go camping for a week. Finally school was over and as we were all saying our good byes and see you next year to all our friends. My parents came to pick us up in what my dad called an ""@CAPS"" that looked like an ordinary school bus. We were now off on our way to go to our camping site.  Now you would think that going camping would be for bringing the family together and having fun. But no my brothers were locked into their video games, my mom and sister were both on their phones while my dad was driving. I even asked them why they brought electronic devices and all i got for an answer was a ""because"". Finally i just decided to let it go and read until we got to our camp site. Finally we arrived and the first thing we did was unload the @CAPS and set everything up so we could get comfortable. The same night we were all by the toasty camp fire, and as usual my family was being entertained by there video games, cellphones or everything that they thought was needed out here in the wilderness. As i sat by the fire i gazed at the stars above my head and started to wonder if my family was always going to be like this and never be a close, fun or even exciting family.  The next morning after we were all awake my parents were making breakfast, and my mom had asked me if i remembered to close the @CAPS door before going to sleep in my tent, and i said no i forgot knowing how my mom was she got a little mad and asked my sister to go close it. As she walked up to the door she heard noises and went inside to see what it was. Before i could even blink i saw her sprinting out of the @CAPS and screaming off the top of her lungs. Right behind her were a group or raccoons chasing her! My dad trying to be a hero runs towards them trying to scare them off, but fails and gets bit on his butt.  Luckily my dad was @CAPS but while we were all distracted the raccoons had left with our food. My dad was so mad that he kicked the only log that kept the @CAPS from rolling away. And it starts moving right away, we all watch it go down the hill until it rode into a lake. Slowly it started to disappear once it was completely out of sight we all went to the lake staring at the large lake that devoured out @CAPS wondering what we were going to do with no vehicle. As we were heading back to the camp site all you could hear for miles was my family arguing. not paying attention of whats in front of them my mom fell in to a mud pit and my dad tried to get her out but slipped in too. Once they got out they looked so outraged and looked as if they were ready to call out mother nature to a fight.  Once we made it back to the camp site we sat down and i took a good look at each one of us. Our clothes were all wet and covered with mud, we were all hungry and not really in the best mood. I sat there and said dad don't get even more mad but but i thought it was pretty funny when the raccoon bit your butt, and i showed him the picture i took when it happened. My family then all looked at it and started laughing and laughing we all suddenly started talking and actually acting like a family! We decided to just walk home and hitch hike, we walked down the road for a good hour until we got a ride from a local trucker we saw down the road. Once we got home we talked more, we spent more time together we were really like the perfect family i wished i could have. That camping trip changed us all and I'm happy that it did because now me and my family are closer than ever! And that's how I can prove that laughter is an important part of any relationship.",18,17,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0

So we sat down and talked to find out what we could do and were we wanted to go. So @PERSON had a few ideas one was go over to @LOCATION house were there was an air conditioning his other idea was to walk @NUM miles to @CAPS swim hole, but the only reason he wanted to go was because his girlfriend would be there,really know one hates @CAPS but no body wanted to walk that far in the heat ,then walk back to @CAPS @NUM had three ideas number one of his ideas was walk to his uncles house @NUM miles away to see if we could catch a ride to @CAPS @CAPS, his second idea was to go down to our friends @PERSON's house and go swim in his built in pool, his third idea was to to go in the back yard i spray our selves with the hose. @PERSON had two ideas one was to see if he could get his mom to lend him some money to fill his tank and to pay her back,his other idea was to drive to the coast and camp there for a few days if he got the money from his mom.Byran had three ghetto ideas one was to go jump in the water fountain by the @ORGANIZATION then quickly get out before we got in trouble, second idea was to go over to the @LOCATION...A.K.A. the @CAPS @CAPS and hop over the fence and then he was going to let us in, his third idea was to go over to the old people homes and swim in there pool there because he said he knew a @NUM had three ideas one was to walk a mile to to the forks , second was to walk down to the creek @NUM miles away third idea was to get a whole bunch of fans and run them threw out @CAPS room. I was with @PERSON on his ideas pf going to the coast and camping and what not because i love to camp at the beach it smells all pretty most of the time there is really fine chicks so yeah i was way down to go to the coast for real.So we sat and we waited and waited and waited for @PERSON's mom to call us finally his phone rings we were all excited but it was just his grandma calling him we were bummed all hell. so there we were once again waiting for what seem to be for ever for a phone call by @ORGANIZATION's @NUM phone ring we didn't have hopes up this time we figured it was some one else but guess what this time it actually was @PERSON's mom she said that she'll lend him the money but us boys had to do something for her she wanted us to go down to the bimor and pick @CAPS from work then buy her some cigars for @PERSON's grandpa so we did.After were done the earn run we packed our clothes,blankets,sleeping bag,food,camping supplies, and wood.After a good hour it was @NUM @CAPS.M. we went to the chevron and fueled @PERSON tank then we were off to @ORGANIZATION city @LOCATION the drive to almost two hours it seemed but what a beautiful ride long tunnels beautiful river , mountains oh and who could forget the beautiful tall red woods of @LOCATION and the smell of that forest you can smell it through almost any car.I thought it was funny when we got close to the coast the temperature dropped like @NUM degrees @CAPS and ever-body was in a good mood and could smell the coastal air.When we got to the camp site we ran out to the beach as jumped in people look at us like we were crazy or something because we swam like @NUM feet out in @NUM degree water it was funny because people wouldn't stop talking but then we found out we were swimming a red zone were there has been rip tide advisories so after that we were really @LOCATION and we realizes we had no propane so we had to go into to town and get propane for our stove so we did then we ate the best hot dogs ever dipped in @ORGANIZATION honey it was delicious.We stayed at the coast for a night then @PERSON got called in to go to work so we had to leave and go back to the heat in @CAPS @CAPS @CAPS it was a way way big drag and it was so hot getting back we pretty upset at the weather but when we got back @CAPS mom wanted to go out to the river so in the end it was all good.",17,15,30.0,30,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0
12971,21626,8," In most stories mothers and daughters are either enemies or friends, in @CAPS story however, we are both enemies and friends well; at one point we were that way. Not @CAPS much anymore. I'm sixteen now and she's forty and were just friends, I mean she's still @CAPS mom and she still can punish me as her daughter as she pleases but we work it all out and laugh it off. Approximately seven months ago @CAPS mom moved from @LOCATION to @LOCATION, @LOCATION I chose to stay behind to finish high school with @CAPS current friends. When she moved, the way we acted with eachother would be different, and it is, we act completely different with each other we now cherish the little time we have and I'll explain how. At the beginning since as early as I can remember, @CAPS mother and I would always fight over the dumbest things, we never got along. And here is what I think the reason is. I'm her daughter I was born just like her, her face, hair, eyes, everything, even @CAPS attitude and the sound of @CAPS laugh. She's stubborn I'm stubborn and we both like to argue, not really with other people just with us two, but if we were to go into business together things would get done, say if we became lawyers we'd work great together because I inherited her work ethic and we both like to argue valid points. But as I grew up a bit more and we experienced traumatic times together we began to see the brighter side of life, and that just having each other around is enough to keep us from falling apart. Events in our life that we went through brought us together @CAPS it was all finished and done. What I mean by that, is we stopped arguing, we comforted each other when we needed comfort, we became friends, and I believe laughter had a lot to do with it.  @CAPS mom, her name by the way is @LOCATION, once said ""Laughter brings two people together as a whole, the one thing that human beings all know how to do is laugh and its something we can all share."" @CAPS our life had settled down and we were able to live normal, like with a house and lights and a dog with a yard, things were good between us we still fought often but never as it used to be. Which would consist of throwing objects across the room at each other, like I said things are better now. We one night discovered, that laughter is something we both use to block out the things we no longer wanted to haunt us. I love to sing, @CAPS mother and @CAPS had me grow up around music like; The @CAPS, @LOCATION, @PERSON, @PERSON, and many others but we would sing a song together something that only the two of us shared and it was ""@CAPS're @CAPS @CAPS"" by @PERSON. But we would sing that specific song in the car, we would sing it in front of our family and @CAPS the moment was over we would laugh about it, because for once was something that only @CAPS mom and I shared and it was special. Laughter played a big part of who we are as people today. There are always things people do together, @CAPS mom grew up in a strict @CAPS @CAPS home, she also had four sister's and @CAPS was a very serious matter. @CAPS mom and I went to @CAPS together and we always tried not to take life @CAPS seriously all the time, @CAPS while in @CAPS we would start @CAPS about some kind of ugly bug on the wall, or she would laugh at me because I would drop the prayer book on @CAPS foot, but we would always laugh."" @CAPS it or I'll bring @CAPS @CAPS over here and @CAPS'll have to take an extra religion class.""@CAPS mom would say as I'm poking her or making fun of her and i would say "" @CAPS wont make me take an extra class I'll tell him @CAPS started it."" That's who @CAPS mom and I were and were still like that. Even though she moved to @LOCATION for a new job, and @CAPS she could see the man she loves more often than every six months, we still talk, and like I said we laugh when we cry and boy do we cry a lot, especially on the phone when I tell her I miss her.  That is the story of @CAPS mother and the laughter that we have shared for the last sixteen years, and to quote @PERSON ""@CAPS is the best calorie burner."" I do believe that and @CAPS mom and I see it as that, @CAPS is the one thing we can do when we don't feel @CAPS hot or don't feel like ourselves, @CAPS yes she is correct when she states that laughter brings two people together, and it's positively true, we have a better relationship than ever.",17,18,0.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.0

12973,21629,8,"When you laugh, is @CAPS out of habit, or is @CAPS cause? What are the causes for laughing? Is @CAPS even such a thing as a ""cause"" for laughter? I'm sure that if you were to get a scientist's opinion, you would be given an in-depth, technical explanation for the cause of laughter; but does that mean that laughing is simply a message sent from the brain to the required muscles? Certainly not! The true cause is what was said or done to cause the brain to send the message to the required muscles to physically make a person laugh. So what makes people laugh? A funny joke, a senseless action, a misunderstanding? @CAPS can be anything! Without a doubt, one thing that makes people laugh is having a delightful time with a friend or two. @DATE, @CAPS older sister @PERSON and I unknowingly went out on an adventure. We were headed to @LOCATION, @LOCATION to visit our very best friends, @PERSON and @PERSON, who happened to be almost completely identical to @CAPS sister and I in personality; @PERSON being like @PERSON and @PERSON being like me. Now, whenever the four of us got together, @CAPS was no telling what kind of humorous and insane memories we would all go home with; all we knew was that hanging out together @CAPS failed to brighten up our days and put a smile on our faces. This particular day, both @PERSON and I were in desperate need of each other's full attention and up-lifting spirits. She and I had both been going through a rough patch with some friends at our schools (oddly enough, we were both having friendship issues with someone named @PERSON, and we didn't even go to the same school), so after some discussion between both of our sets of parents, they agreed to have @PERSON pick up @LOCATION, @PERSON pick me up, and well all meet somewhere to take our minds off the antagonizing situations were were both suffering through. We decided to meet in @LOCATION, at @PERSON and @PERSON's house. When we pulled into their drive way, I could feel @CAPS body being filled with excitement, as if the emotion was trapped inside some kind of storage container inside of me that was too small to hold all the contents that were being held inside. Before the car engine was completely turned off, @CAPS seat belt was off and I was half-way out of the car door. I slammed @CAPS shut once @CAPS body had slithered its way free and ran for the door. To @CAPS surprise, @CAPS was unlocked! I pushed @CAPS open obnoxiously yelling, ""I'm heeeeeeeereeeeeeee!"" @CAPS was a cry of laughter that filled the room. I hugged both of them in one tight squeeze, and almost as if @PERSON and I had our very next move planned out, we immediately began chattering about the incidents that had occured that day as we took a seat on the couch. All that could be heard was, ""@CAPS @CAPS @CAPS! I have to tell you what happened today!"" and "" I can't believe she said that!"" or ""...and she said...and then I was like...so then she says...""@CAPS was just as if we had taken up the life of a drama-ridden teen straight out of the movies.

Minutes creeped by, and we were still laughing at the off-key remark. To this day, @PERSON and I remenise upon that afternoon and the laughter that was shared upon us and our very, very best friends.

Whether it was about something stupid I did, or my best friend doing something stupid, or most of the time when we got together and did something outrageous. Someone once said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". With my best friend @ORGANIZATION and I, that's exactly the case. I always get a good ab workout whenever I'm with her, because I'm always bursting with laughter. It was my @NUM grade year at @ORGANIZATION here in @LOCATION, @ORGANIZATION. I was hanging out with my best friend @ORGANIZATION during our lunch break outside. I was showing her my new jeans I'd just gotten the day before, at @LOCATION. I was also telling her about a note that had been passed to me, by a boy who had apparently had a crush on me for sometime, this boy had also asked me out on the note. @ORGANIZATION had asked me if she could see it, when I handed it over to her, all of a sudden, she chucked the note over the fence. Clearly, the guy didn't have @ORGANIZATION's approval. I couldn't just leave the guy hanging without an answer, especially when at the time, I liked him back. I begged @ORGANIZATION to give me my note back, but she refused. What was I supposed to do, just let an unanswered note lay on the other side of the fence? No. The only solution was to hop over the fence and grab it. So I, in my new jeans might I add, practically straddled the fence, and ripped a big hole on the inner side of my thigh, in my brand new jeans. I was so mad. I grabbed the note, and climbed back over the fence in my new and improved hobo jeans. On my way back over, I lost my balance, and fell of the fence. I ended up losing the note again and planting head first into a pile of mud and pine cones.  What an idiot I was, I'd climbed over that stupid fence, ripped my jeans, biffed it and lost my balance, and lost it again. I was so frustrated with myself, I started laughing. I'm not sure if it was because I was embarrassed or what, but I randomly started cracking up. Then @ORGANIZATION started laughing, and when she laughs I laugh, because her laughter is so contagious. Pretty soon, we were both hysterically laughing like a couple of dorks. ""Laughter really was the shortest distance between two people"" that day. Even though I probably should have been mad.... But why do that when @CAPS can just laugh about it? That's what life is all about, living. With this silly but funny memory, it'll stay with me forever. Especially now that @ORGANIZATION has moved away. It @MONTH seem stupid, but it was funny to us. I guess it really was one of those ""@CAPS had to be there"" kind of moments. But it reminds me of the good old days with @ORGANIZATION. It's good to have memories filled with laughter. If @CAPS don't, your life can almost feel dull without it. Even if @CAPS laugh at just the smallest things in life. That's why to me anyways, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"".",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
12975,21633,8," Many people believe that laughter can improve your life. Laughing lets out endorphins that give your body energy for daily activities. Relationships are usually better if both the people are happy. Happiness is like shaking up a soda bottle. Happy emotions build up in your body and when shaken, release with an explosion of positive emotions such as laughing. When I was born, my mother said that I was the most chubby baby in the world. As she said this, she laughed, in constant thought that I will eventually become a young adult. I giggled in the backseat of the car as we drove home together. I was taught by my mother, who laughed all the time until her eyes were full of tears, to laugh at every chance I had. Through my years as an infant, I giggled, chuckled, and laughed my way to adolescence. As I moved into adolescence, I was diagnosed with @ORGANIZATION's @CAPS, a mild autistic @CAPS that has a variation of side effects. Some people who have @ORGANIZATION's @CAPS develop cases where their emotions do not show physically. This case is similar to the physical features of @CAPS @CAPS. My main case with having @ORGANIZATION's @CAPS is that I do not receive all the information given to me at one time. When people tell me a joke that they think is hilarious, I tend to miss the important parts of the joke, which are funny. As the joke comes to an end, everybody around me is laughing, but I am standing there with a blank look on my face. Sometimes I tell people I cannot laugh. Though I say this, I know it is not true. I can laugh, it is just really hard for me to find the right time. Most times, I laugh at a situation that really is not funny and everybody else has a blank gaze on their face. This usually makes me feel embarrassed and I don't feel normal. A lot of people tell me I look expressionless and then try to perk me up, or smile. I don't feel the need to smile, even in happy times in my life. I have not laughed enough, but have been learning in how to make bad situations into great and happy ones. Learning that at any moment I can laugh is important. Even if there is no joke being told, I can laugh. Most people would probably look a me in a weird way, but I wouldn't care because I am the one that feels happiness inside. Laughing relieves stress, makes other people feel good, and allows people with mental disabilities to feel more comfortable in the community they live in. I have finally learned that even with @ORGANIZATION's @CAPS, I can laugh just as much as anyone.",20,20,0.0,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,40.0
